"Considering the overall flying time from Muscat to Houston via Doha was 19 hours or so I was dreading to do it in an economy class flight. However do to pricing factors for a business class ticket, I transferred my amazing American Express membership reward points to my QA account and credited it with miles. After having done that I called up the call centre who said there weren't any seats available for miles. I was disappointed as  I had already transferred my amex points out by then. As my date of travel arrived, departed Muscat to Doha on economy I had a 2.5 hr transit in doha and felt like trying my luck at the customer service counter.  Unfortunately my hope for an upgrade via miles was not entertained by the lady stating I was not eligible. Not giving up i was directed by another  staff to head to the counter where the security checks were. One staff typed away on his system started making calls and told me theres just one seat available which only could be released after confirmation from his team which would just one hour prior to departure. Keeping my fingers crossed 10 minutes later he told me I was able to avail the upgrade! The efforts made by Ahmed were so remarkable that I insisted I raise this to the management that staff like this should be admired and rewarded for such excellent service and should be role models. The gesture made such a difference to the whole trip as the Qsuite on the A350 is an amazing experience and I think it's a better than even the A380 business having the double bed feel side by side to your partner is wonderful. We've shared our experience with friends and family stating it's not just a 5 star service on board meeting the right staff gave us a 5 star service on ground too.",1
"First experience flying Small Planet was a great success. We often go to Greece to visit family in Volos and usually fly EasyJet to Thessaloniki. Our flight from Gatwick to Volos via Skiathos on 31st May was a bit late leaving due to bad weather at Gatwick. The plane was not Small Planet but had been chartered from Air Afriqiyah but flew with Small Planet crew. Most passengers were flying in and out of Skiathos with only six on to Volos. The plane was cleaned and restocked efficiently at Skiathos while the six remained on board. We flew direct home from Volos a week later on a Small Planet plane. On both flights the crew were friendly, helpful and professional. The planes were clean, well stocked, seats comfortable and legroom adequate for a short haul with the Small Planet plane appearing quite new. We were very happy with all aspects of our flights and will certainly use Small Planet again to Volos.",1
"Melbourne to Kuala Lumpur via Singapore. Bought Emirates tickets but fly with Qantas and Jestar. Used to fly Emirates and the services was pretty good so we went back to Emirates. Both Qantas and Jestar was ok too but this whole codeshare thing had really ruin our family trip. Ticketing was not transferred properly from one airline to the other airline and we have had to scrumble to find our own way. When customer purchased a ticket from one airline their expectation is solely to that particular airline. Otherwise we could have chosen other airlines. Nearly missed our flight. Treated poorly at counter and was told it was ticketed by another airline so we didn't get to choose seats, food or nothing at all. Essentially a subclass customers. We did not know nor had chosen Qantas and Jestar. Not once heard of Emirates other than paying more and handed to other airline including a budget airline.  We have had to carry our infant on hand despite empty seats are available. It was horrible.  Totally unacceptable.",0
"Gatwick to Sofia. Efficient and on time for both departure and return. Cabin announcements were complete and non intrusive. Aircraft was clean and cabin staff were great for full flights. The purchase on board of wine and snack package was really good. For the money paid for this flight, this was incredible value.",1
"Flew to Cuba from Fredericton food has gone donehill this was our 7th and last trip to Cuba. Flight was late leaving Fredericton 19th April and late arriving on 26th April. No communication to us while we were waiting to be picked up in Cuba. Pizza definitely not recommended. attendant informed us we should buy the ""duty free"" on the trip to Cuba because the supplies would be gone on the return flight. So this was done then much to our surprise the Cuban security staff seized our ""duty free"" alcohol and said we could not even put it in our check in luggage on our way out of Cuba. We now have to declare what we are bringing into Cuba gifts cell phones all electrical devices we are carrying.",0
Stockholm to Odessa via Warsaw with LOT Polish Airlines. First flight to Warsaw began OK. After a while captain said that due to foggy weather he had to go to Gdansk. There we stood waiting for two hours. The plane was filled with petrol but our stomachs didn't seem so important. When we later started to Warsaw they said they wanted to give us a cup of coffee or tea for free.  When they came to me I said I wanted to order a sandwich but it was impossible. I said I must eat but they didn't have anything. I told I had an important business meeting in Odessa and some minutes later she came back and told me that flight to Odessa should wait for me. In Warsaw I was running to gate 21. They had never seen a pensioner running so fast at this airport. When I came to the gate door was locked and nobody there. Why they promised when they couldn't hold it. The plane was still at building and they had to wait only for some seconds. Had to wait 26 hours on their next flight. ,0
Johannesburg to Bloemfontein. My flight was due to leave at 0610 but when I got to the boarding gate at 0550 the gates were closed.  I went to SA Express counter but there was no one there to assist. I was the told by the check staff that I had to purchase another ticket.,0
"First time flying with Silver Airways. Booked the flight because of their association with JetBlue. Biggest mistake! I knew something was wrong when there was only one ticket agent at the counter attending the guests to check in their bags. She took her time and looked a bit stressed. In addition, the departure time and gate information did not match the ticket sent to me. I asked about it and she said it was a mistake. Fast forward, we board the airplane and it was hot! I don't think that the temperature got to tolerable state ever! We land at FLL and my bag was not there. It was left at JAX due to weight limitations. This was never disclosed my the agent in JAX or in their website. I was told to file a claim with their Guest Relations team. They do not have a phone number. It's only an email. They denied the claim! This is an airline that should be non existent. They lack experience, customer service, professionalism, and appetite to excel. It is a joke! People complain about Spirit, this is that airline but on propellers with about a third of their employees and experience. Run! Don't waste your time or money!",0
Bangkok to Koh Samui. Cheap fare but directed to lounge with free refreshments snacks and Internet. Onboard for a 55 minute flight there was plenty of food available. Great service and good leg room.,1
"Oulu to Helsinki. Easy check in with Finnair mobile app. Smooth boarding. Cabin fresh and clean. I had good legroom because a seat on the exit row. Complimentary coffee, tea, blueberry juice and water. It's enough in the 55 minutes domestic flight. Also I bought beer and some crisps. Excellent cabin crew who were friendly, smiling and efficient. Very nice experience.",1
My wife and I travelled with our daughter and her 20 month old baby to London. We travelled in First Class. We did the same trip last year but without our daughter and her son. Naturally we were a little bit nervous about travelling with the baby but the staff were so accommodating helpful and friendly that we had nothing to worry about. The staff on both legs were superb in every respect. The food was excellent and the First class sleeping pods were excellent in every respect. Comfortable clean and well appointed. We will travel with British Airways every time we could not fault them in any way. Just one minor thing that is no fault of British Airways. When they call the flight there is a dedicated boarding row for First Class passengers but it seemed that everyone was able to use this lane which means that we had to join the queue rather than just walk straight through. I know that this sounds rather pathetic but surely if one is prepared to pay the additional fare one should be entitled to some form of privileges. We have travelled with British Airways on many occasions and each time we have had the same wonderful experiences.,1
"My flight was cancelled and we were just told to either get a refund or rebook another flight. All flights to George Bush airport were fully booked that day. So much of an inconvenience since in the first place i booked the very first trip to have adequate time for possible delays. Able to book going to Hobby airport. I just need to be in houston that day. Unfortunately my checked in baggage was delivered to George bush. Not an urgent need but an inconvenience. Toll free number takes 45 min to call you back. Inquired with AA ground crew at the gate who just shrugged their shoulders. They were all in a rush to go coz their gate was about to close. Finally boarded to fly to hobby airport. I could not understand a thing the flight attendant was paging overhead, her words were garbled and carelessly pronounced.",0
London to Toronto. Boeing 789 plane is so poorly configured that passenger comfort is given the least importance. Seat width and seat pitch of 30 inch is too tight for long flight. Long lines at the washrooms. Avoid this particular plane.,0
"I was impressed and happy with the service, friendliness, food and entertainment on board. This was a big improvement to flights last winter with the old Business Class. The crew were great and the 10 hour flight went by quickly. The A380 is quiet and smooth in the air and LH has done some homework and the hard working flight crew made the difference. In my 16 years of flying the captain did greet the Ladies, gentleman and children on board.",1
"The inflight entertainment is very poor, so I think SpiceJet can improve this service fast. Overall the cabin crew are very good, however I don't like the entertainment.",1
"I was extremely disappointed in the service my husband and I received on our flights using Etihad Airways. We first flew from Dublin to Abu Dhabi using Etihad and thought that the poor service could have been a fluke but we were wrong. On our direct flight home from Abu Dhabi to Toronto the service continued to go downhill. The flight attendants were rude and not helpful. It took over an hour for someone to come to us when we turned on our attendant light. Attendants would see the light and walk right past us. Passengers around us also had this problem and we heard chatter about how the staff was rude and they had received better service on other airlines. The food was not good either. I understand that plane food usually isn't great but after following Etihad on Instagram and reading other things online I expect better, especially on such a long flight. I have had better food and service on one hour flights with other airlines. Also, there is a lack of organization at the airport for this airline. Getting through the gate was a logistical nightmare and the Etihad staff did not communicate effectively with patrons. Everyone was everywhere and did not know what was going on. All in all, poor customer service and poor organization led to a very negative experience flying with Etihad.",0
"Their meals and services are excellent. Both ground and onboard services are friendly, enthusiastic, and professional. Flight attendants  wear a smile on their faces and are very prompt and attentive.  If I have the opportunity to take their flights again, I will definitely choose them without hesitation, looking forward to enjoying their excellent services and delicious meals again.",1
"Flew on Tuesday before Thanksgiving. No problems at all. I have to admit I do not like that we not even offered a drink. So you need to make sure that you carry on a beverage of your choice and any snacks as there is nothing on the plane. The plane was not full so the stewardess offered people to move to another seat so they could stretch out. It was very expensive but I assume that it was because of Holiday travel. I would fly again, as very pleased with this airline",1
"Extremely disappointing. Corona crisis started. They basically cut all phone numbers, closed offices and let us without information in Thailand. They were still selling tickets for the next few days when they cancelled our flight back and did not allow us to take place on those just to sell more expensive tickets. Definitely a rip off. Emirates. Don't fly. It seems like a better pick up line for your commercials.",0
"My husband and I flew home from Orlando to Seattle on Monday night on Alaska flight 19 from MCO to SEA and had the best time! The flight crew were very accommodating and joked around with us each time they came by our row, messing with us about our drink orders. My husband and I are pretty fun people so we really enjoyed the playfulness on such a long flight. This was our first time flying in the premium section and the extra 4 inches of leg room really makes a difference! Plus, you get a free checked bag as well as complimentary drinks the whole flight. I always fly Alaska when I fly and have yet to have a bad experience and will continue to fly Alaska any time I can.",1
"I was told I'd require a 48 hr negative covid test for entry into Philippines. Booked my trip via BA.com, with a transfer in Singapore. They delay my transfer to the next day, okay, not too bothered as have my 48 hr negative covid test, but when I try to check in at Changi Airport, the Philippines Airlines check in staff require a 24 hr negative covid test. Had to rush to a different terminal, get tested, wait for the result, rush back to check in ...the gate had closed.  Had to book an extra night in Singapore hotel, book my own flight to Manila, then also the return journey back to London. If one misses one leg of a BA booked flight, the remaining flights get cancelled.  I discovered Oman Air Business Class and better then British Airways, from treating their customers, quality of service, the business class experience.",0
"Los Angeles to Ft Lauderdale. If you have never heard of the saying ""second class citizen"" then fly this airline. If you are not in First class then you are a second class citizen. I would have purchased a first class ticket but there were none available. This plane only had 12 first class seats. TV did not work for most of the 5.5 Hr flight. Have to pay for internet.",0
"I booked the flight for my Christmas holiday via the S7 website in the summer. On 16 October they informed me that one of the sectors was cancelled. They couldn't provide any alternatives as all their flights around the Christmas period were full. I had to buy tickets with another carrier, paying double of what I previously paid. When I raised a refund with S7, they made me pay an additional cancellation fee. I won't use their website ever again.",0
"Economy flight with Alitalia is very frustrating and stressful. Departure Gate changed Last minute, no announcement or signs to advise. Seats onboard unclean and storage pouch hanging partly torn away, hanging on my leg. The cabin staff were pleasant enough. They lost my luggage, despite an immediate report at Baggage Claims, the process was very poor for recovery. So 3 days later no luggage yet, and no answer at Customer Service.",0
Luton to Belfast International. I paid extra to pick my seat. There was a biting cold wind with gusts to 50mph. Boarding was really slow so I got to stand around on open steps for several minutes whilst people got their stuff packed. When I got on board my carefully chosen window seat turned out to be next to a screaming baby. I swapped with one of the parents so I was then one row away from a screaming baby. On a flight with unallocated seating I would have picked a seat 15 rows away. The next time I flew with them they made me pack my carry on bag in the hold. There were seats which were near empty luggage bins but the bins near my allocated seat were full. It meant I had to hang around waiting for my bag to arrive when I should have been on my way home. They are trying to act like a premium airline but without the infrastructure or the organisation. It takes too long to board so they end up running late. If I'm boarding from a sky bridge then its not so bad to have to wait whilst people find a specific seat. However with Easyjet if I am queuing outside I want everyone onboard and seated as soon as possible. When I've got a choice I will use some other airline.,0
"The new Air France Business seat is full flat, comfortable and provides very good privacy. 1x2x1 seat layout on the Boeing 777 allowed me to access to corridor easily. What surprised me most is their food, which has improved a lot. I was well entertained by the IFE during the flight.",1
"I greatly regretted booking my flight from New York to Madagascar on South African Airways. While this was the most direct route, the headaches and hassles associated with South African's booking system and web services were extensive. As a result, we spent hours trying to do such simple tasks as obtain seats, and had to spend 2 lengthy sessions on the phone with customer service, only to arrive at JFK with the problems unresolved. It is a pity that one of the leading carriers of Africa cannot run a basic website. They claimed our credit cards had been declined but on checking with the bank, there was an ample credit line and no record of any related transaction. Nor was the information concerning excess baggage relevant or accurate. Way too stressful a way to approach a 20 hour journey. Two thumbs down.",0
"La Paz to Santiago. We flew as a family for a holiday in Peru. The few short flights we had with LATAM were riddled with problem after problem. We missed our first day of our trip, because LATAM sold our prepaid tickets, so we had to wait 6 hours at the airport, to get another flight. We were unable to check in 48 hrs prior, as there was no wifi. On another flight, our bags were lost for 2 days. They had inflexible seating arrangements, resulting in splitting our small group up. We will never travel with LATAM again and highly recommend using alternate airlines.",0
"Everything is in the fine print when you book a ticket with American. We bought three tickets from Boston to Chicago and paid for three, yet they gave one of the seats away. The answer if you look at the fine print, you agreed to the terms. That's way I try to fly SW, Jetblue and others.",0
Recently flew Birmingham to Keflavik return. Prior to the outbound flight I checked in online and moved our seats to 10a and 10b both of which are in the Economy Comfort area and offer a little more legroom than standard Economy. There was one drinks run and one duty free run. The selection of films was adequate for a 2.5 hour flight. The return flight was onboard the specially liveried Hekla Aurora which was nice as it was due to do the run to Gatwick that day. I again had checked in online and obtained exactly the same seats so the return flight was just as comfortable. I enjoyed using Icelandair and certainly would again if I was flying to north America from BHX rather than travelling down to London. One tip though is that if you are checking in online definitely get yourselves into the Economy Comfort zone and in particularly rows 8 if you are travelling as a couple or row 7 which is just behind Saga class and is very quiet.,1
"Mauritius to Madagascar via Reunion Island. The flight has been delayed from 4 to 7 and now 9.15 pm, no communication or support from the ground staff. They knew about the delay before the departure from Mauritius but did not inform the customers. Acces to lounge was given only after insistence from us and only to who has asked for it, not to all afected travelers, and no airline representative has spoken to us, as we should be grateful for the lounge access. No alternative connection was offered. Kids and old people were left without even water and waiting confused. Very unprofessional staff and airline!",0
Had a 6 part trip this month on AA. Every leg had issues. Mechanical problems abound due to the age of the fleet. Arrived at JFK for the vacation portion of this trip and was told at the first class check in that our aircraft was removed from service and we would be 6 hours delayed departing. We missed our first day of vacation and a party because of this. Bottom line you can't rely on this company to get you where you are going in any reliable way. Also have issues with their website frequently down lack of communication with flight delays also.,0
Delhi to Bangalore. Worst experience ever. I had 1 stop flight. First flight delayed for like an hour. Next flight delayed for 6 hours without any further notice. This is my first and last time going with this company,0
"Sofia to San Francisco via Istanbul. I booked this flight back in March for my parent's first visit to US. I was beyond excited I have found such a convenient flight that will fly them to US. Today, I received 10 texts from Turkish airlines my flight has been changed. When I went to look up the option, duration of one way was about 24 hours. I am extremely disappointed, because my travel agent is trying to get a hold of the Turkish Airlines and they can't . Now, I am waiting to see if I would be able to get another fight company. Words cannot describe my anger and frustration and of course huge loss of money. This is totally unprofessional and unacceptable.  Very disappointing, no one seems to care from customer service. Extremely bad English and bad communication over the phone.",0
I flew on July 7th from Ft Lauderdale to Gatwick. Flight was on time no one at the airport at 9.30 pm so security was a breeze. Very efficient boarding was in a premium seat which was comparable to other airlines business class. Lots of room nice quiet flight and I did notice much less drying of nasal passages which normally affects me. The Dreamliner is a vast improvement on lighting etc. The food service which was included in premium was actually quite good. Good movie selection really there was nothing to moan about. Nice friendly flight attendant. There is no WiFi on international flights. This is a winner for me needing to travel between Ft L'dale and Gatwick four times a year.,1
"The cabin staff specifically the male flight attendant was more concerned with women not carrying their purses than people not wearing their mask during the flight. Covid19 safety is non existent with this airline. People were coughing, not wearing masks but the cabin staff where mainly concerned with telling the young women to place their small purses and bumbags on the floor. They ignored the older women and allowed them to carry their small purses and hand bags, their priorities are all messed up. I'll never fly VietJet again for health and safety and the rude flight staff.",0
"Horrible, horrible airline. My flight was delayed twice, and the airline was not helpful at all. Leaving customers stuck at a city, despite offering a refund, is still very irresponsible. I've had a very fixed schedule, and due to EW's fault, I have suffered a great deal with my work and personal life. I do not recommend flying with this airline unless you really have no other choice.",0
"Melbourne to New York via Guangzhou to New York. Both flights were above satisfaction and the friendliest cabin crew I flew with. Chances of getting both long haul flight with above satisfaction is very rare, they deserve the compliments. Other than service, food, entertainment and cabin overall experience is good too.",1
"Dallas to Vancouver with American Airlines, and this is the worst airline ever. Its ridiculous how many times the flights are cancelled and they leave the customers in standby and they don't care where will they stay overnight or anything. If your flight is cancelled they can make you wait days for next flight. The service is horrible and for them pretty much they are doing you a favour rescheduling the flights they cancel. I would put no stars this airline doesn't even deserve one star. ",0
Charlotte to Denver. How is it that the airline requires it's customers to show up at least 2 hours before their flight and there is nobody available at the ticket counter to check a bag until 4am? Every other airline has representatives available. With the amount of money you people charge for a ticket there should always be a representative available for your customers.,0
"London to Melbourne via Abu Dhabi. This has been my worst ever experience with an airline, thanks to a defective airplane. Long story short, 12.5 hours flight with full on aircon is not a must have experience. Asked one of the cabin crew if we can adjust or dim down the aircon but got a negative answer in return. Result was babies crying all the time, people complaining for good reason, even had the quarantine members cone on board upon landing in Melbourne due to some passengers feeling ill.",0
"On arrival we checked our cases in, not surprised to find only a small queue. Both the flight out and back took off on time. I am 6 foot 3 and even I had enough leg room. Despite the flight only been 2.5 hours we still had a movie to watch. The breakfast we were served was okay however the roast dinner on the returning flight was very filling and tasty. Would recommend.",1
"Jieyang to Singapore. My boyfriend and me were on flight 3K 824 on 30 July 2018. We were very impressed with the service rendered by the 4 crew members. It was a full flight with quite a number of infants, toddlers and impatient elderlies, yet the crews displayed an outstanding amount of patience, cheerfulness and an overall great service. It really made a difference to the general atmosphere of the flight. Thank you for a memorable experience. Good job, keep it up !",1
"We had a bit of a mix up with our flights getting unknowingly shuffled, which split up our group of travelers. We were under a lot of stress the last couple of days trying to get it changed and were unsuccessful. We decided to take a chance and go to the airport to try and fix it. The moment we got there, the man working for the airline at the front desk was the most helpful and kind person he could have been. We told him our situation and where other staff members refused to help on the phone, he immediately did everything he could. He managed to get us all on the same flight and all the way home. He was the most calm and kind man. I wish I had known his name, but he worked at the Honolulu airport at the front main desk. He really saved our trip.",1
Flew Hawaiian from Sydney this August. Could not sit in lounge at airport until just before boarding. Arrived at Honolulu to Big Island. Boarded plane but could not take off. They had no air con. Finally took off but could not disembark. Door could not open. It was an extremely long trip. Coming home we were told just before boarding from Honolulu there would be no audio for. 10 hour flight. I had to upgrade as I cannot sit in a confined space for that amount of time. Seated in business class. The air con was freezing all the way. Given IPads but battery kept running out. Could not rewind to where I finished my movie so had to watch it all over again with another IPad. The air con was freezing all the way home. Even the crew were wearing jackets jumpers etc. it was the worst trip there and back we have ever encounterd. Never again. Could not even get a cup of coffee after dinner. Only tea. Did not have decaf coffee. Someone forgot to make it.,0
"Moscow to Kosice via Warsaw. The worst airline in the entire world! They cancelled my flight from Moscow 2 months ago, but they didn't tell me about it. No email, no call, nothing. Then I came to the airport and was wondering why my flight is not on monitors. I was told by LOT representative that the flight was cancelled 2 months ago. You didn't care about me overstaying my Russian visa because of the cancelled flight and I had to chase it and PAY for it. And honestly nobody wants to go through the stress I went because everybody knows how hard it is to get permission to leave Russia if you overstay visa. Then when I got eventually to Warsaw I have asked 3 times at LOT desk if they will handle my luggage all the way through to Kosice. I was told yes, because it's a connecting flight. Then I came to Kosice and of course my luggage is lost. I will never fly with them again.",0
"Icelandair is not ready for the big league. Three of four segments from Milan to Portland via Reykjavik required us to depart or enter the plane on the tarmac and take a bus. Reykjavik airport is a mess with construction and detours that change from day to day. The staff is over worked and stressed. Our flight crew was late causing an hour delayed departure to Milan. The result was we missed the last shuttle to our hotel so a 30 Euro taxi ride was incurred. Of the 4 Icelandair flight segments three were delayed and we had to rush through the Reykjavik terminal to get to our Portland flight which was also delayed. The Icelandair business strategy appears to be ""sell the tickets and we'll figure out how to make the flight later"".",0
Terrible experience during the crisis. No compensation and customer service is a robot answering mails. Company in decline. Will never recommend to anyone.,0
"Flew on the GA862 Jakarta to Sorong on June 10th at 12.30am. The boarding gate 24 is located a long way from the lounge area, however there are buggies that are available for anyone to board and they will drop you off at the gate. The boarding process was straight forward as there were two gates one for Business Class and Sky Priority members and the other for Economy. The flight took off a little behind schedule as there was queue for take off ahead of us. The flight itself was ok considering it is a night flight. The cabin crew came around through out the flight offering snacks and drinks, it would have been much better if they had of switched the cabin lights out and aloud us to sleep. The flight landed in Sorong close on schedule time, however it took much longer than usual for my baggage to be delivered for a business class passengers. The service overall from check in at Jakarta to landing in Sorong was good, but Garuda could do with a rethink about switching the cabin lights off after initial meal has been served as that would allow people to get some sleep.",1
"Upgraded to Business Class on our British Airways flight from Madeira to London on December 28th, paying a premium of E105 per person. Disappointed understates our reaction. Our seats were not comfortable business class as I remember, but exactly the same as the uncomfortable economy class seats behind us, distinguished only by a curtain defining where economy class finished and business started! British Airways standards are slipping!",0
"London to Minsk via Frankfurt. Horrible experience, flight leaving London was late and missed my flight to Minsk by a few minutes, was told at the check in desk that customer services would book a hotel and get me on a flight next day, they rebooked on the next evening flight but refused accomodation with the excuse that my flight landed at 18.30 and the connecting flight didn't leave until 19.15 which is the legal minimum for connection so they weren't liable, it transpired that they told a lie and that the departure gate had closed at 19.00, the customer service staff for this airline are thoroughly unpleasant and seem to take a sadistic pleasure in seeing their customers in a state of distress.",0
Lisbon to Salvador Bahia. Flight plastic free. The first one I have travelled with. And they had Ipads to comfortable watch what we preferred. The distance between the chairs was large.,1
This airline has cancelled a flight with no notice. Only 2 service desks open for all delayed passengers. I understand from another source that instead of being booked on a direct flight at a later time there will be more than a 24hr delay in my arrival at Vienna as the replacement routing is via another airport. I would recommend anyone to think twice before booking with Austrian Airlines. It's not as if this is an intercontinental movement. Any airline worth its name should be able to arrange a replacement aircraft at reasonable notice.,0
Rhodes to Birmingham Saturday 5th July. Over eleven hours late with no explanation other than 'technical problems'. It should have left after nine hours but no staff were on duty to keep us informed and a 7.30 am flight finally took off at 7.16pm. The staff were miserable and surly. No route map on the inflight and the front toilet locked on both journeys.,0
"Hong Kong to Singapore. Unfortunately took this Cathay Pacific flight in Jan 2018 from HKG to SIN during midnight, very sad news was the last minute aircraft changes due to NO reason. From A350 1x2x1 seat configurations to B777 2x3x2 seat configurations, the cabin was so narrow, very similar to economy class seats. I missed out my meal service, I understand passengers may sleep during the midnight flight, but there was no one asking about if I am okay to wake up during the meal service, after I woke up, there was no on asking if I want have some meal before the flight landed.  Will not take Cathay Pacific flight again.",0
"Calgary to Phoenix. First time flying with WestJet. The aircraft was only equipped Economy Class and Premium Economy, I was pretty nervous about the room and comfort of the seat. They put a cup holder in between the two seats and it was actually not that bad. Worth the money.",1
"Barcelona to Menorca. Vueling is a disgrace for traveling. It is highly disfunctional and there is no low cost. We spent Saturday on a beautiful summer day at the airport in Barcelona for a 40 minute flight to Menorca that was supposed to leave at noon and so far at 8.30 pm we still don't know if we are taking off. BTW the round trip fare was above 200 dollars. The staff know nothing, and the kept dragging the issue all day so here we are still waiting.",0
"Amazing experience, new comfortable aircraft, professional staff, great food and beverages served. Very comfy seats. Convenient transfers in Doha Airport.",1
"I am a frequent flyer and fly around Europe using different airlines. My experience with Swiss is always one of the best ones. Since I have been flying with them years ago, they never gave me a chance to complain about anything. Decent aircrafts even though some of them are old ones, very friendly and attentive staff and really good service. My experience is mainly based on short haul flights within Europe. The only downside for some may be higher pricing, as they are slightly expensive than other airlines but then better service to compensate.",1
"Los Angeles to Portland. Southwest has some incredible customer service. I completely messed up and accidently missed my flight to go back home. I briefly explained what had happened and without hesitation, the very friendly female clerk got me onto another flight within a few minutes. There was no charge, no hassle, and before I knew it, I had another flight back to Portland. Very appreciative of the great customer service and the williningness to work with their customers.",1
"Been the worst travel experience, our flight was supposed to take off 11am Qatar time, we flew until 6pm with no regards to our schedule, no communication from the company, the flight, seats, staff, everything was horrible. We landed early morning on the next day, to find out that our luggage was left behind in Doha and no explanation provided at the airport in Casablanca by staff. The best of all is that they tried to blame Qatar authorities for that, no ownership taken, came back next day on my cost and had no clothes to wear, had to buy new personal care stuff early morning to refresh myself, and drive again back to Casablanca from Rabat, just to find that both my suitcases arrived broken,. Tried to file a complaint and up till now no replies by email and been trying to call same way no answers.",0
Flew Rouge Toronto to Phoenix 2 days ago. Knew it would be tight but they could put more padding on their seats. After a 5hour flight back was extremely sore. Agree with others the flight attendants appear to have little to no experience. Purchased a business class meal in economy and it took them over 2 hr to collect the tray and plates. My husband had no room on his fold down tray. And when we asked for it to he taken attendant refused. To top everything off because things were so tight we accidentally left our passport holder on the plane and didn't realize until next day. Fortunately got passports back but money was stolen. So try to speak to someone to report the theft and AC states they have no one on the ground in Phoenix as they have a third party. But they don't even have contact numbers to report the theft. Next time will fly either WestJet or Prter with JetBlue.,0
San Francisco to Portland. Oversell their flights constantly. Here we are still at SFO because they do not have enough flight crew to even begin to board the plane.,0
"My sister and I were flying from Boston, MA to Toronto, ON and then onward to Gatwick, UK. It all started when we got to the airport as suggested 3 hours early.  They are open for 2 hours only per day.  We waited for an hour to check our luggage. Finally when the one staff member did show, the gentleman checked our luggage all the way through to Gatwick. Well, needless to say it never got there. My sister and I went to submit a claim. Claim number should be emailed to us so we can check the status. Never got that. Here we are in Gatwick with a friend we haven't seen in 8 years and we have to spend our time buying clothes and toiletries and then drive an hour to the airport to see if we can at least see if it was there. We get to the airport to check. We spoke with a woman who at first seemed helpful. Said she would walk us through security to check the luggage so we could see if it was there but first had to bring someone else through. We wait, wait and continue to wait. We see her, making eye contact, trying to keep ourselves in check. My sister went over and she forgot about us.  Then she tells us that she doesn't have that clearance. I was so confused, she just did this for someone else! They tell us to come back in 2 hours. We have already spent 2 hours here and this is our vacation! So, we ended up getting a number to the baggage area and the woman on the phone regrettably gave us our claim numbers. I was an inconvenience to her. My sister had a 2 week trip. London first then to Cardiff, Wales. We did not get our luggage for 7 days. When we did, my new large piece of luggage was broken. It would no longer roll and the top handle was coming out. So, I kept all my receipts and am finally home. I went online to submit my reimbursement claim and their online service is ""temporarily unavailable"" since yesterday. I sent them a contact email regarding this. No confirmation, no email back. I am now on hold for the last 2 hours trying to find out an alternate way to submit for reimbursement.",0
I travelled back with easyJet to Luton from Corfu yesterday on flight number EZY2372 with my parents who are both disabled. The cabin crew were marvellous to us all and I can't thank them enough for their pleasant and helpful attitude. My partner and I have just brought a villa in Corfu and this excellent service means we can now feel quite comfortable in inviting our parents to stay with us.,1
"I have to admit after reading all the articles, I was a bit nervous flying Allegiant but my experience was a very positive one. We had to wait a bit to check in, but it wasn't too long or too bad. Staff were courteous, helpful and cheerful. This is no frills airline and one should investigative all add on charges. They don't serve complimentary soft drinks or snacks and you do have to pay for carry ons, but the overall savings was a plus. I would fly with Allegiant again.",1
"Tampa to Las Vegas. This is now the 2nd time Spirit has cancelled a flight without proper notice. 1st time we were delayed almost 4 hours due to a crew shortage which they verbally announced over the loud speaker. After 4 hours, they ultimately cancelled the flight stating 'inclement weather' being the reason so they didn't have to compensate for their error. No offer to book hotels, supply ubers for this flight of almost 200 people. I missed a job interview because of this mishap and I had to practically stalk them for a partial refund. All the while, the staff was absolutely unprofessional, almost downright hateful towards all the passengers trying to rebook. Against my better judgement, I booked again trying to save a few bucks. Not even an hour before take off, I get an email that the flight was cancelled with no reason given. I am writing this review in hopes it will deter people from booking with this airline because the stress they cause is not worth the money 'you save'. Save yourself and book Frontier.",0
"Ranchi to Bangalore. Worst service I have ever experienced. I had scheduled to travel from Ranchi to Bangalore. They have cancelled the flight just few hours before departure when I was traveling to airport. I asked them to arrange any connecting flights as it is really important for me to travel that day, they replied with a smile. When I asked for next available flight they replied after 30 hours. Without any other option I had to cancel the ticket and counter booked a ticket from indigo. GoAir didn't even regret for the caused inconvenience. They just told we nothing to do with this. I frequently travel in AirAsia and indigo but my first experience with Goair created such a bad impression that I would never book GoAir in future under any circumstances.",0
On time departure. Excellent value and they gave a meal on a 2.5 hour flight.  We arrived 30 mins early. Staff was professional. Bags delivered in a normal amount of time.,1
I had booked 8 tickets from Mumbai to Mangalore and return for next month and I paid around Rs. 28000 for flight bookings and now spicejet cancelled scheduled flights and now my important function is getting affected because of flight cancellation from Spicejet. I need to pay higher fare for flights booking of other airlines. This airline don't even bother to call once they cancel prebooked flights. Don't ever go for Spicejet.,0
"I couldn't legally travel and the airline refused to refund or allow a change of flight. I've asked for a statement that they won't provide a refund so that I can claim it through insurance and they refuse to provide one. The customer service is extremely rude and absolutely useless! Their website doesn't even make sense, none of their customer emails work, if they cant set up a proper email I wouldn't trust them to fly a plane.",0
Return flight to Sydney on an updated 777 and it was a great travel experience. Departing Seoul was a little late but given a call day before departure and were well informed by the airline. Check in very efficient and ground staff welcoming. Onboard service was excellent and the crew were incredibly accommodating. Dinner and breakfast the following morning was great. I had the Western my partner had Korean and we both really enjoyed our meals. Entertainment screens were wide and clear and was impressed with the touch screen display. Nice choice of films games and music. Seats were comfortable and sleeping was great with good recline. Arrival was on time despite delay and it was a very pleasant flight.,1
SFO to Dusseldorf a 10hr nightmare. No leg room overcrowded plane rude staff no choice of entertainment seats very hard with little cushion. Not significantly cheaper than the major airlines when you consider a sore back is assured after arrival.,0
We travelled from Singapore to Colombo and then onto London. The shorter flights were older planes but still comfortable. The long flights both ways had lie flat seats and we all slept for about 5 hours perfectly comfortable. One of the planes had on demand TV the other you had to wait for movies to start but it was fine. Where they really excelled was their food and service the food was very good and served very nicely and they also changed the choices around for my daughter. They put us up in a hotel on our return transit through Colombo so it was very easy. Much better than Qantas business class and for about a third of the price on our dates.,1
I travelled from Perth to Kuala Lumpur return with Air Asia. This was my first flight with this airline and with budget airlines. It was a pleasant experience and I am planning on more trips with Air Asia. The staff were charming and helpful and the plane was new and almost as tidy at the end of the flight as it was at the beginning.,1
Our first flight with Wizzair from Skopje to Memmingen and all was correct there was no delay. Food was just for sale but for a normal Price. Flight staff were very friendly. We can recommend.,1
"Flew South African Airways from Johannesburg to Lagos on 19th September and returned 23 September. Flight left on time arrived a little early both destination. Food was good. My rating is for based on my return flight, I did not feel well during the last few hours of the flight and the crew let me sit on their seats where the temperature was not as hot as in the cabin and the provided me water etc. They let me sit there until we were almost landing and I began to feel much better. They were very concerned and helpful and I am really grateful for their assistance.",1
"From start to end, nothing but problems and hassles, service is the worst, the hostesses treat you with disrespect and stress the fact that they are not there to serve you but to control you, very rude and the team leader was sitting down and stuffing her face all the time like she was in first class. The plane arrived at 1am from Vegas and now it is 2.2am and our luggage hasn't arrived nor has the belt started turning. Please, pay the extra money and save you dignity and avoid this garbage.",0
"Pleasant Flight, great staff, always try to fly with Alaska when I can, however I was not impressed with the food product. The first class service was great, but the food was not so good.",1
"Seoul to Honolulu. I want to commend the flight attendants for handling a unruly passenger on a flight to Honolulu. A young lady wanted the whole row of empty unassigned seats at the rear of the airplane because she wanted to sleep during the flight, but there was an older woman already seated there. When I boarded she was sitting with her friend a few seats forward then when she got up to move the older lady was already there. This young girl made such a fuss about her wanting the seat before the other lady. The flight Attendants asked her to sit down because she was delaying takeoff. The flight attendants finally got the old woman another seat  and let the young girl have her seats. A flight officer from the cockpit came out to see what the delay was. The flight attendants did right by defusing the situation and dealing with it so the plane could take off.",1
"Calicut to Washington via Riyadh. I could not travel in Saudi Arabian Airlines. There was a 14 hour lay over in the Riyadh airport. I got to know that they ask for transit visa for spending time at Riyadh. I contacted the ticket agency, Goibibo, they tried to contact Saudi airlines, the online agent waited for 8 days for a response from Saudi Airline, but they never got. I tried to contact Saudi Airlines myself. I called to airport airline help desk, but their first answer was ""cancel the ticket"" we cant help with a transit visa. I asked for a full refund, and lost money as a cancellation charge from Saudi Airline and even ticket agency Goibibo took a good amount of money from my refund.",0
"Beirut to New York via Paris. The food was disappointing. We took a long flight, and the least that they can do is provide a decent meal for the people that are paying this much to fly with them. To be honest, i wouldn't fly with them again.",0
"Good flight from Bangkok to Dubai with Emirates, but excellent flight from Dubai to Birmingham. Lounge at Dubai quiet and great breakfast offerings. Crew on DXB to BHX excellent with very attentive service and food and wine of top quality. Inflight entertainment very good.",1
At Gatwick on way to Marseilles we had to wait for about 40 mins in a spiral staircase as plane door would not open. Then on way back I had to pay 60 Euro to be allowed on board with exactly the same luggage I boarded on way over.  Seats don't recline. An awful experience I will never repeat.,0
"The American Airlines staff in the Akron Canton airport were incredibly polite and helpful. My flight with Southwest was delayed which meant I would not catch my connecting flight to Las Vegas. American Airlines was exceptionally courteous, especially about my emotional support dog, who travels with me everywhere. They were happy to greet and pet my dog and she was pleasantly invited into all three flights I had to take home. All other airlines I have flown with were not so pleasant about my dog flying with me. I was met with positivity and an excellent level of customer service from every employee. Thank you so much for easing what would have been a very stressful travel day. I will fly with AA again!",1
Almaty to Kuala Lumpur. My family and I travel with Air Astana and are accustomed to a high level of service provided by the airline. During a flight last week from Almaty to Kuala Lumpur I witnessed a crew have to respond to an emergency medical situation about an hour into the flight. The professionalism of the Captain and Crew in handling the situation resulted in saving the life of a passenger. Medical emergencies can happen to anyone and at any time. Having experienced the crew's actions first hand I am confident that my family and I are in safe hands with Air Astana.,1
Pathetic experience with this airline. Many time they rescheduled my flight without any call. Just drop a simple message. Even customer care people are very arrogant. Will never travel again with this airline and never recommend.,0
"Flew Singapore Airlines from Bangalore to Singapore in economy and it was an excellent experience. The service was good and food was really good. Timely arrival and attention to details are something that they are really good it. If there was one area to be picky, that would be the choice of movies in the inflight entertainment. I will fly Singapore Airlines again !",1
In December 2013 we flew from JFK to Istanbul Turkey then on to Rome Italy. Our flight was 0004. After reading some of the reviews for Turkish Airlines I was concerned about our trip. We were however pleasantly surprised. The flight crew was friendly accommodating and generous with drinks and food. We flew Economy Class. The seats were as comfortable as they can be after 9.5 hours. The movie selection was good. The crew is what really made the flight great. If all Turkish Airline employees were as good as this flight we would definitely fly with them again.,1
"Marrakesh to London via Casablanca. When we arrived at the airport in Marrakesh our flight had been cancelled and we had a connecting flight in Casablanca. After waiting for several hours we were bussed to Casablanca leaving us no time to catch our flight. After going through security we were told at baggage drop it was too late. We pleaded with them as it wasn't our fault and were told to leave the line and find a manager which we refused to do as we had no time. We explained the situation to them and no one wanted to help. Eventually we got the go ahead and were told to run to the gate. There were several more checkpoints to go through with long cues and no help. We had to run from point to point and when asking for help were just ignored. The gate was at the far side of the airport so eventually arrived with a pocket full of cash that we couldn't spend in the duty free, dying of thirst as we couldn't stop to buy water and dripping wet through after all the running. All we needed was for one member of staff to be helpful and get us to the departure gate quickly through security and it wouldn't have been an issue. I have never come across such unhelpful staff.",0
"Amritsar to Atlanta via Doha. I am posting this review on behalf of my mother and father. On way from Amritsar to doha my mom fell in flight and the cabin crew gave foot massage to her. They not only help my mother, they also vacate the nearby seats for her and  provided drinks on regular basis to her. After they reached Doha, cabin crew brought a wheelchair for her and helped them checkin for next flight which was from Doha to Atlanta. From Atlanta also they helped a lot to get onto next plane to Nashville. I am thankful to cabin crew of Qatar Airways who helped a lot to my mother .. thank you, you are really awesome.",1
"Faro to Gatwick. Yesterday flew home on EZY8920 and the crew were excellent. Polite, attentive and efficient. This may go against the grain of some recently read reviews but I think when customer service is provided well it should be praised. Yes a good level of customer service should be the norm absolutely, we pay our money and expect nothing less. However all of us expect a pay on the back occasionally for a job well done and this crew deserve just that. Thank you also for the care shown when my daughter in law felt a little unwell. Well done easyJet!",1
"Terrible! Delayed, delayed, then cancelled. Couldn't reschedule for three days, no reimbursement for lodging, and rude service. That's what you get for flying with the lowest bidder.",0
"Traveling with 1 kid and 1 infant from Los Angeles to Bangkok via Seoul, Asiana was the best kid friendly airline that we have experienced. We received a call 4 hours from Asiana Customer Service before the flight to inform us that our flight was going to be delayed by an hour. This allowed us to leave an hour later, minimizing the time our kids would spend waiting at the airport. They were also very accommodating on the flight, allowing us to walk around the back of the plane with the infant, and they were very accommodating with our drinks and meals. Highly recommend this airline if you are traveling with smaller children.",1
"Hanoi to Danang. Finally an airline that has bought back the service in Vietnam. Impressed and hope they keep it up. Check in seamless, lounge infinitely better than others in Noi Bai. Flight left as scheduled could not ask for more. Definite value for money.",1
"London Heathrow to Riyadh. Worst Business class in terms of food quality and in flight service. Boarding was ok after delay of 30mins, seating and layout of the new Boeing 777 of is great and now have full flatbed seats which is a plus. However the food quality has gone downhill very fast since the past few years. The flight attendants were asking passengers what they would like to have for dinner while I was in the prayer area in the back and obviously missed me. However when the food was being served I thought they were asking passengers at the time if what they would like to eat. Clearly no one served me anything which got me concerned resulting in me asking one of the flight attendants why am I not being served any food. Still no food or acknowledgement, then I decided to ask another attendant upon which the response was that I did not ask. Seriously! Anyway after a long wait I was served the food and upon slicing the piece of steak I found it stone cold inside. Again I had to summon one of the attendants and complain, who apologised and took the plate to heat it, when it finally arrived, it was very low quality.  Also no amenity kit for Business Class passengers on this night flight, the response of the attendant was, that the kits were not loaded at London. Saudia can be a perfect airline if it improves its catering quality, variety and train its flight attendants to actually care about passengers.",0
Flying now United Airlines round the world starting from Europe. Never again on a UA flight unless it is the last choice. They started me on a feeder flight from Oslo to Frankfurt only to tell me that they pushed me 24 hours on their flight to Chicago because they simply cancelled the flight that day. I did not accept and got across with Air Canada but ended in Toronto rather than USA. Had 5 internal flights in the US scheduled time seems an approximate time not a target for UA. I boarded in Washington on UA803 via Japan with same flight number going to Singapore. After boarding we sat excess 15 hours in the plane awaiting for UA to finish their maintenance. Arrived Tokyo only about 40 minutes late but was told too late to board the 803 flight to Singapore. On arrival I had a good 30 minutes and only hand luggage. Tough luck same flight number means 2 different airplanes on the two legs and no margin to be late crossing the Pacific. 6 hours waiting with shifting to Haneda. Business class and Star Alliance Gold card means nothing to UA's level of service. Never UA again.,0
"My wife and I flew Spirit the other night from Cleveland to Las Vegas. This is a new route for the airline. We bought two Big Front seats for cheap and it allowed us to have basically a business class seat compared to other airlines. Our flight left on time and arrived on time! I could not have been happier. I am glad Spirit is expanding in Cleveland since United has cut flights and charges too much for tickets. Make sure you understand the bag charges and pay for them if you can before you leave your house. Otherwise it will cost more at the airport. Some people complain that Spirit ""nickels and dimes"" customers but that is not how I see it. It is more like ""a la carte"" style where you pay for what you want. I highly recommend flying this airline!",1
"Absolutely useless. Late flight, luggage left behind, zero customer service. They just don't care, no refund or credit for taking exit door seats away. What once a great airline is now the world's worst. Do not fly Qantas they just don't care.",0
"Bangkok to Moscow with Rossiya Airlines. Not the worst airline I flown with, but far from good. For the money they charge, service should've been much better. Food was average, seat comfort was none. Didn't get any sleep. Plane was packed, overcrowded, and even in these conditions the price for the ticket was outrageous. Because of that virus situation, it was the only airline flying and they knew it, so the price was unreasonable. I'm pretty disappointed, mostly because of how much money I've spent on this ticket, totally not worth it.",0
I was already seated inside the aircraft and noticed I left my jacket with my wallet inside it at the boarding gate. I explained the situation to one of the flight crew and she accompanied me to the waiting lounge. She made my trip one of my best trips.,1
"Very expensive to fly with American Airlines. We purchased our tickets in errror on line and they would not reimburse once they have your money. When they mess up too bad the customer pays and they say they are not responsible for any additional costs incurred. Their plane had problems which delayed our take off for four hours. The terminal staff were rude and arrogant. Their problems caused us to miss our connecting flight and our hotel transfer. We had to pay to regain both and they are not willing to reimburse because it is not there problem. They said they would send me a voucher to travel with them again, but after reading the reviews from others, I don't think flying with American Airlines will be happening again",0
"Wonderful airline! I booked our trip with Southwest Airtlines, and it was quick and easy! I booked our hotel with Southwest also. The boarding process was efficient, and the flight attendents were wonderful. The complimentary beverages and snacks were appreciated, and One Free Bag was great. I have nothing but compliments about Southwest!",1
"Port Elizabeth to London via Johannesburg. Another excellent journey. Both flights on time, both planes almost new with bright cabins, great crew and great food. SAA are a revelation compared to BA.",1
"Melbourne to Guangzhou with China Southern. The flight attendants were very courteous, friendly and accommodating with requests. Food and service were excellent and seating was comfortable. Information screen was faulty showing distance and time to Australia instead of China, information reversed.",1
I used to recommend flying Delta to friends and family. I fly very often and they used to do a great job. This past time while flying they disregarded the seats that I had chosen and put me in the very back row on all of my flights. I get very bad anxiety back there and was very unhappy with this. When I kindly and calmly asked them about this they told me that you now need to pay extra in order to choose a seat ahead of time. Flights are already starting to cost a lot more so there is no way that I am going to pay extra for a seat every time that I fly. I will never fly Delta again as long as they operate this way.,0
"Due to Covid Pandemic, they cancelled the ticket.  Vueling doesn't even respond to me. It's been one year. Still, nobody answered I sent dozens of mail. Long story short, they are just turning this crisis into an opportunity by aggrieving their own customers. They don't even have the dignity to answer emails. Highly not recommended.",0
"Flew Los Angeles to Toronto. Air Canada is easily the worst airline in the western world. How can one airline loose so many bags, be so late for so many departures and arrivals, offer the most disgusting on board food and employ the nastiest most incompetent staff and still be in business is a mystery to me. Air Canada's hatred of its customers is evident at every level of the company and can be seen in every single employee you come in contact with. Air Canada is a national disgrace and embarrassment of Canada and should be avoided at all costs. Take a plane, a boat, a train.",0
I could barely fit in my seat and the customer service was absolutely terrible. Very complicated to figure out how to get where. There was a pot of confusion at the gate. There was nothing pleasurable about flying with them. If at all possible avoid them unless you are truly stuck somewhere.,0
"Venice to Seoul via Doha and my first flight with Qatar Airways, and I was nicely surprised by the airline. Everything was great although the flight was super full! New plane, clean, great inflight entertainment and nice cabin staff. I've also appreciated that they give you a beauty case and socks for the travel. The layover in Doha was very good, in fact the airport is new and full of shops and restaurants. Qatar Airways is totally recommended.",1
"It is an absolute joke that Air Malta does not have an app in 2023. Plus the prices are absolutely ridiculous. I don't know what revenue strategy they try but should definitely reconsider it. It make zero sense. A ticket in economy costs 430 euros and a ticket in business class 290 euros on their website, at the same time, and for the same destination. I understand this is not a low cost carrier however it really acts like one. Too bad you don't have other options if you want to reach the destination.",0
"I paid and book several months in advance a flight with the company Corsair and to my disappointment I end up on a charter plane of a Portuguese company flying from Montreal to Paris. Why pay for Corsair flight at a full price to end up on a foreign charter plane. Entertainment onboard only has old movies that I have seen in flight on other routes several years ago. No relation with the one that is posted on the Corsair site. Moreover the French leaves a lot to be desired on board. My mother tongue being French I myself had difficulty understanding. I call this stealing customers and this is the last time I would travel with Corsair. Pay the price for Corsair and finish with a charter company called Hi Fly, no thanks.",0
Amsterdam to Prague. Do not use this airline. Really bad experience. Booked tickets with cancellation insurance. Missed my flight due to a 2 hour delay in security check. The airline did not inform for possible delays in the airport due to national holiday. I called them twice from the queue asking what to do and they told me if i am checked in the plane will wait. I called them again after i lost the plane and they asked for 400euros per person to book us in the morning flight and were not helpful with the insurance. I don't think this is professional and customer friendly approach. We had to miss our holiday but there were people in the same situation that were returning home and had to book hotels and miss whatever obligation they had the next day. I would not recommend this airline.,0
Heathrow to Zagreb 8th November and returned 12th November. I travelled with a sporting rifle and as a result expected to have problems. The booking in going out and returning was smooth and well conducted. The staff were very pleasant and helpful. The flight was smooth and reasonably comfortable for an economy seat. The meal quality has gone down from previous trips but when I consider the price and duration of the flight I think it is very good value. I have difficulty walking so always ask for a seat near the front door and in every case I have been obliged.,1
"Seattle to Denver. Used to fly Frontier Airlines all the time but boy have they gone downhill. Nickle and dimed for every amenity. No complementary beverage service, chairs dont recline, trays the size of a small tablet. Rude agents, attendants who have no customer service skills. Nightmare",0
Sarajevo to Amsterdam via Vienna. Very rude and it takes them so long to answer your call and give information. They delayed my flight and didn't even let me know what will happen with my connecting flight. Also they give themselves the right to take away your cabin luggage and lose it afterwards. Never flying with this company again.,0
"Edmonton to Ottawa via Calgary with WestJet. I don't understand the point of completing online early check in. In the past with WestJet and still with other airlines when you choose your seats for the flight they are yours. That no longer seems to be the case with WestJet, choosing your seat means nothing. I selected a changeover in Toronto but for whatever reason WestJet decided to change that to Calgary. The flight times changed also by over an hour making it not possible for me to make my schedule. At no time did WestJet make an effort to inform me of the changes, I found out when I got to the airport with no time to make other arrangements. I believed WestJet was supposed to provide better service to its clients. I am disappointed.",0
"Hamilton to Halifax. Besides the outrageous hidden fees and uncomfortable seats, the flight was delayed for an hour as one out of the 4 staff had to leave home sick and we had to wait for a new attendant. On return from Halifax flight delayed again for no reason, only update I had was an email. Boarding time comes and still no new update so I ask customer service at the desk and she says ""I have no idea when we will board"". I said can you at least update us so we dont have to keep asking, her reply was ""you'll know when we announce the boarding time"". I don't mind the delay things happen what I mind is the attitude of the personal. Not helpful at all. First and last time I use this airline.",0
"Do not fly American Airlines unless you are willing to have your flight changed. I booked a flight months in advance on a flight that only had one layover with less than two hours in between. I did this on purpose so as not to expose myself for long to crowds of people during this pandemic. American changed my flight weeks before I was to fly to having a 6 HOUR layover before my next flight! When I contacted the airline the only solution they could provide me was a double layover in multiple airports to ""break up"" the time of my flight. So instead of one stop with a six hour layover I would have two layovers with several hours before each flight took off. This was there way of ""helping"" to compensate me for their changes. What they did was change the size of plane I would be flying on. That was the whole reason for the extended layover. Do not fly with them. If you do be prepared to have your flight changed, or delayed. Nothing else was even offered to me for the changes. No upgrades. Not even access to the Lounges. This is not customer service. Now my day went from an 8 hour day of flying to a 15 hour day of flying.",0
"I have flown Hainan Airline three round trips Chicago to Beijing.  My flights were clean, seat and inflight temperature comfortable, attendants were friendly and helpful, many options in flight entertainment programs. Most important is flights were on time. I fully enjoyed the long flight.",1
We were suppose to leave on July 10th and got notice on July 6th that they had cancelled our flight and moved it back a day. The airline did not reimburse us the money we lost from our airbnb. The flight was not comfortable and the food was not good.,0
"Beijing to Brussels. I chose Hainan Airlines after 2 days comparison with numerous other flight companies and it turned out to be a lucky strike. The service in the air was way beyond my expectation. All staff on board were friendly serving with hospitality and the food was satisfying. After informed that my earplug was ill shaped, one of the attendent kindly gave me a new one. The movies provided on the plane are various and newly updated, and I had a nice sleep during my long trip. I will recommend my friends of it.",1
My trip from Manila to Tagbilaran was moved by 2 hours and 50 minutes got a 3 day notice from Zest Air 3 hours of wasted time and they refused to rebook me for free. Same thing happened to my return flight Tagbilaran to Manila. This time there was no notice that the flight was delayed by 2.5 hrs.,0
HKG to Phuket. Full flight. Boarded quickly crew efficient and plane spotlessly clean. Breakfast not amazing but ok. Captain informed us of progress some TV on drop down screens. Good overall. Loads of drink service tea coffee soft drinks and water.,1
Just back from a fantastic 2.5 week trip to Thailand flying to and from Bangkok with BA on 777 aircraft. I definitely would choose another airline next time. We flew out on 31st December 2014 and the crew were surly and inattentive. Asking for a drink seemed as if it was really putting them out. One of the crew swore when communicating with her colleague during the drinks service within ear shot of us. Outbound they run out of the the meal choice for both very small meals by the time they reached us so we had to had the veggie option. For most of the flight the crew were camped in the galley at the back seemingly having a party with colleagues whether working or not so you felt it was a imposition to ask for water or snacks. My inflight entertainment system had streaks all across which couldn't be rubbed off making the movies very hard to see. Return flight crew on 16th Jan were much less surly but again conspicuous by their absence meaning you had to try and wade through the party at the back to try and get water or snacks during the flight. Two passengers were flicking raisins about the cabin onto other passengers which might have been spotted had the cabin crew had more of a presence. The inflight entertainment system had major issues which meant it didn't work on demand making it hard to plan viewing of movies. Again 2 very small meals at the either end of a 13 hr flight with very limited options for snacks in between. One staff member said they had very little left then allowed a passenger to grab about 5 packets for herself. Tray table was broken in seat 27b also. The crew said as it was an early flight they knew we all wanted to sleep but the flight left just before midday so not what I call a night flight. I used to love flying BA as have always been impressed with their service in the past but now the planes and the crew seem tired and I am sorry to say neither my partner or I enjoyed the experience. Will look to EVA Thai or one of the Middle Eastern airlines next time.,0
"Port Macquarie to Brisbane. Dreadful. The age of the plane is ok, however the claustrophobic set up of the cabin is dreadful. The seats were small. We are average sized and were wondering how we were going to fit into the chairs. I have a chronic pain condition and within 20 minutes I was beside myself with being cramped into such a small place. No knee room, no room to reach anything in your handbag on the floor, barely can you put your tray table down. The water and white bread half sandwich was pretty random, not even a cup of tea. How on earth you fit so many overweight people in those seats is beyond me. What happens when large people book 1 seat? Which is the size of half a normal seat?",0
"fastjet from Windhoek to Dar Es Salaam. Plane was alright and comfortable for this price. Cabin crew was friendly. You pay for your drinks and beverages on board. But they lost my luggage, and are not willing to pay any of my costs as they say they don't take any checked in baggage through another airline. Be aware of this, because I couldn't find this in their terms and conditions! I found it also really hard to get in touch with them.",0
"Flew from Albuquerque to Miami with a layover in Dallas. Attendants refused to assist with check in demanding the Kiosk be used. Refueling delays in Dallas. Luggage arrived slightly damaged, but filthy. Clean your luggage compartments!",0
"Never received an email that flight was changed or cancelled! I am flying with my 2 young children and an infant by myself and now stranded in Calgary. Read many poor reviews, but decided to give the flight a try anyway. Never again will I book with Lynx!",0
They lie and cheat and leave you stranded. We waited in a lay over for 5 hours to find out last minute at 10 pm our flight was cancelled. We were given a letter and told to find another airline to fly and we would get reimbursed. 2 months later did not get reimbursed for alternate flights needed to get to destination a day later. Contacted every avenue of customer service provided all needed documents. They all lie and say it will be taken care of but it's not.,0
"Atlanta to Dallas via Corpus Christi. The staff refused to help my partner and I with Hotel accommodations that ATL promised us to due to our delayed flight caused by mechanical errors. Told us we could camp out in the terminal until the next day and mentioned we could go online to find hotels without means of transportation. Finally spoke to someone from AA Customer Service who did, in fact, confirm that mechanical errors automatically provide paying customers with hotel accommodations. By the time we reached the phone agent, the staff literally left the premises and did not return to us and left two of her desk agents to help us out. What a sorry excuse of a Supervisor.",0
"Los Angeles to Lansing via Chicago. No TV screens to view during flight, internet was down, couldn't even stream on personal device. The snack was a pathetic tiny bag of wafers, asked for a diet coke, got a half of a tiny glass. About 2 swallows. Absolutely a joke. I will avoid flying United at all costs in the future. They really need to step up their game.",0
I booked my tickets through Indigo to travel to my hometown in Kolkata during Diwali. I am impressed with the services provided by Indigo. A320's were clean and spotless with great sitting arrangements and ample leg space.,1
"Ruined our trip to Disney World! Me and my 8 year old daughter waited at the airport for 7 hours, delay after delay! I just couldn't take it anymore going to be delayed till after midnight? We were supposed to leave at 6pm. Pathetic Airline! I had to cancel everything over their stupid, incompetent employees and planes! I'm furious! Flight 1879, Departure from Austin to Orlando. Oct. 28th, 2022. Never even left Texas! I hate you Spirit Airlines!",0
"Cebu to Manila. 5th flight with Cebu Pacific, 5th time there has been a huge problem, 4th flight cancelled with no information, terrible staff communication, no snacks or good food in the flight, chairs are the worst iv sat in. After this last joke I won't be flying with them again.",0
"I flew with ANA from Jakarta to Washington DC with a transit in Narita on Nov 2021. Boarding and disembarking went quite orderly, everybody waited until it's their turn, so there's no jostling at all. The flight was pleasant and the aircraft was clean and spacious enough. Cabin crew are kind and helpful. Even though the second flight was delayed due to technical problems, it was a pleasant experience. The return date on my ticket is 30 March. But I decided to return this month, in february. I called ANA customer service this morning and got Ms Hisae on the line. She was very courteous and patient with me while trying to reschedule my booking, she waited on the phone all the time when I was trying to punch in my credit card numbers to pay for the difference in taxes, which is a minimal amount. It took quite a long time for the process of rescheduling and submitting the credit card number and Ms Hisae guided me patiently through the whole process which took about an hour to complete, and she chose aisle seats for me too. Thank you so much for your kind services Ms Hisae, I really appreciate it very much. I look forward to fly ANA again on my return home this month. I'm certain the services will be as good as my outbound flight in Nov. I strongly recommend ANA for travelers to Japan or the USA.",1
Kuala Lumpur to Bangkok. I was in the wrong and late for my flight but my friend online checked me in and called a favour so staff would help me when i arrived. But when I arrived staff said she was finished working and left. The plane ended up delayed because the staff were told to wait for me. Clearly staff aren't communicating.,0
"Guwahati to Delhi. My flight booked through Cheapoair for April 15th was canceled, Vistara could not provide the service I paid them for, and Cheapoair will not refund my money. It reflects poorly on your company.",0
Vancouver to El Salvador via Mexico City. I can not put into words how bad the customer service is with this airline and the lack of caring and inability to provide a basic level of service. We did not even make it onto our flight due to outrageous prices to re book a flight on top of our original purchased tickets and with penalty fees. We lost a vacation and a lot of money. I do not understand how an airline is allowed to operate out of a Canadian airport and only offer by phone customer service back to the defunct business they are allowed to run in Mexico. I hope that if anyone reads this before considering flying with this airline please re consider at all costs. This airline is criminal.,0
I travelled Kenya to India. Flight from Nairobi to Addi Abbas was behind schedule. Onboard the flight it was very warm and uncomfortable people were using papers to fan themselves. No good food or entertainment. Flight from Addi Abbas to Mumbai had similar problems. When coming back from Mumbai to Addi Abbas everything was excellent.,0
"I recently flew Turkish Airlines on a morning flight out of Istanbul to Amsterdam. The staff at the Star Alliance Gold Lounge were very unfriendly and did the bare minimum to welcome guests. Boarding for this flight was chaos where Star Gold passengers boarded last. Onboard the crew didn't greet passengers. Plane was showing its age, meals were cold and tasteless and toilets were not cleaned at al throughout the short 3 hour flight. I won't be flying this airline again!",0
"San Francisco to Seoul. My experience with Korean Air surpassed my expectations! The crew of flight KE 026 were kind, helpful, and very attentive. I highly recommend Korean Air to anyone who wants to have a great flight!",1
Change of gates 2 hours before my flight. Made me miss my flight. When they sent me the email update I didn't get it until 15 minutes before the flight because I was on another flight and landed at 8 pm. My flight left at 8.48 and got to the gate at 8.40 to realize they change the gate from A8 to C6! From one side of the airport to the other. Never flying American again.,0
"Toronto to Beijing return with Hainan Airlines was an excellent experience. The cleanliness and cabin service was really good. The seats for a long flight are better than average. On the return trip, their service to transfer from a domestic flight to international flight including changing terminals in Beijing, when we had only a 2 hour window, was outstanding.",1
"Calgary to Vancouver. Outstanding crew, easy check in, easy guidance, easy boarding, flight was empty and didn't even have to ask to move seats we were offered the choice. Flight Attendants gave more snacks and were talkative, and joking. They took their tike to make our early morning flight better! Above and beyond customer service.",1
Athens to Montreal on 4th July. The staff on the plane was absolutely amazing. A flight attendant on flight AC1903 was so helpful and made the 10 hour flight much better and very helpful. It was unfortunate that there are no tvs and no iPads to rent out but we know for next time to bring our own. Great service.,1
Flew Wick to Aberdeen with Eastern Airways. This service is now virtually useless and constantly late. Today almost 3 hours late and we're still not off the ground yet. 6 colleagues waiting for me to arrive in Aberdeen and another load of passengers stranded in Wick having missed business and holiday connections.,0
"Flew AirAsia from Kuala Lumpur to Bali return. Both flights with a 2 hour delay, on the second one I almost lost my long haul flight, even though I had allowed 4 hours between flights. Boarding was chaotic. My advice, dont fly with AirAsia if you have a connecting flight, or fly a day before.",0
Dublin to London City. I booked expensive flight due to family emergency. My return flight has been changed from London City to Southend. Reason given is staff shortages. This is most inconvenient and not what they advertise. No response from cityjet or offer of compensation. Never again.They continually brag about flying you into heart of London. Southend is certainly not that!,0
"Frankfurt to Palma de Mallorca. Reserved seat was ignored, it looks not unusual. My family booked 4 seat together beforehand in website. But boading pass we got in airport forced us to seat far location each other. One lady kindly changed her seat for my son 8 years old to my next seat. She was forced to seat separately with her husband instead. My wife and daughter 11 years old are forced to seat one by one separately.",0
"My bag was lost and the customer service has been terrible. I filed my claim with KLM and the only thing they can tell me is that there is ""no update."" They cannot even find the bag. Nobody I speak to is able to call the airports my bag could potentially be in and ask them to look. They refuse to contact anybody on my behalf, so there is no way for me to know if anybody is even looking for my bag. They only say that their system will be updated when the bag is found. Well, how do I know you even have people looking? I have been more than three days with no update, and I leave in one day. No bag at all. KLM customer services hours are also limited, so you cannot continue to call for updates. Absolutely terrible.",0
"Philadelphia to New Orleans. Do not fly Frontier. In a span of about 1 month we dealt with a cancelled flight from Philly, a 3 hour delay in Philly, and a cancelled flight from New Orleans. The reimbursement does not cover the flights we had to find to get to our destination. Totally ridiculous. We will never fly Frontier again.",0
Mumbai to Chandigarh. I reached the airport 45 minutes before my flight. Ground staff told us that airline will not be accepting us as their customer and counter is closed. Vistara airlines has caused me monetary and unmonetory loss as it was family trip. I,0
"Contrary to other reviews I read about Spirit Airlines, this was a fantastic flight. We flew from a small airport in Niagara Falls to a moderate sized airport in Myrtle Beach. That may have helped the experience as departure was great as was disembarking and baggage retrieval. The website booking, flight status and online check in was great. The service at bag drop was good too. The plane is not large but the seats were wide enough and comfortable enough for a trip of less than two hours. Amazingly we arrived in Myrtle Beach exactly on time! Everything costs extra but the overall pricing was good. We recommend this airline.",1
Very good airline and my favorite for domestic travel. I am a 2 million mile flier on United and I have now switched to Virgin America. I have flown seven round trips this year on Virgin. The food is very good compared to any other US domestic airline. The entertainment is fantastic. There is WiFi. The seats are reasonably comfortable. Although it does suffer from the same horrifically small legroom in economy class it is better than the majors.,1
NRT to CGK. Service was above my expectations. Food tasted really good with superb presentation. Baggage claim was long but probably its CGK baggage handling system's fault. Return CGK to HND. Everything went perfectly. Overall I'm really pleased with ANA. One improvement could be IFE organization as they list same movie multiple times with different subtitles.,1
"Economy flight from London to Auckland return. At 6ft 3"" I have nothing good to say. Far too many seats crammed into the A380. Seats are far too thin and uncomfortable allowing the seats to recline is valid except for when the person in from ends up on my lap! Food is of a poor standard and not enough based on length of trip.",0
"I would recommend Austrian. Excellent service, on time, Vienna airport is excellent without delays. I traveled business. Easy online checkin",1
"I used to be a loyal Frontier flyer. While they never provided any extras, I always found the aircrafts to be clean and on time. After my experience with Frontier today, October 2022, I will never fly Frontier again. The customer service of Frontier is insulting. Our flight was already over 30 minutes late and the gate agents had every single passenger put their backpack in the luggage check. For reference, my backpack contained two outfits and a toothbrush. If your bag did not fit, you were charged one hundred dollars, additionally, a man behind me was having technical problems with his phone and asked for his boarding pass to be printed. They charged him twenty five dollars. These charges are no way to treat passengers at all. I encourage everyone to choose another airline. While it may look more expensive when booking, if you account for all of the hidden fees of frontier, you are in fact saving money.",0
I flew Aeroflot with a connection in Moscow. On my 10 hour long flights we were served two meals! The food was very good considering it was airline food. It was hot with plenty of bread and salad. Free wine was served throughout the flight. We were provided with slippers blankets pillows and eye shields. The staff were very courteous and announcements were made in Russian and English. The entertainment had a terrific selection of movies and music. If you are a tall person you are better off purchasing the emergency exit seats as they were so much more comfortable for someone 6'. Connection in Moscow which I was a bit fearful of was actually a very nice experience. They accepted US dollars. Most sales people spoke some English. Free wifi in coffee shops. The cleanest airport I have ever been to with janitors cleaning the toilets constantly wiping down all chrome pillars in hallways. Sparkling clean. Connections were smooth where my check in luggage went straight to my destination without having to recheck. The smaller airbus for my 4 hour flight to Venice did not have any entertainment video but did serve a meal. I recommend Aeroflot as great airline for the price! Was totally surprised.,1
"I experienced very poor service on the delayed flight from Athens to Heraklion on the 17th of March 2018. I was at the airport for more than 24 hours, very tired and anxious after traveling for a week in Germany. After the trip I also contacted customer care to express my complaints and they also had the same cold attitude that they did at the airport.",0
Flew YYC to LAS a couple days after these flights were Rouged. Flight attendants were horrible either the PA system was poor or their speaking ability or both. The announcements in French would make my elementary French teacher cringe but it wasn't like the English was that much better either it felt unrehearsed and like they were reading off post it notes and need to pause every few words to find their place. The lack of IFE was archaic for a new airline and was the clincher for me to not fly this airline again.,0
"Kiev to Dubai. Staff are far from friendly, seat spacing is too narrow and the worst of all it is always late. I've been using this airline since launch and nothing has changed.",0
The best treatment I received in an airline. Helpful staff meals in flight free drinks in the lounge personal assistance in transfers and access to lounges in the airport for all users.,1
"I cannot believe some of the reviews on here. We have flown with Jet2 on a flight only basis also the last time on a package to Menorca, can't fault them. Service excellent, plane good and the amount of staff to see you through check in etc was brilliant and very helpful. Recently returned from Turkey with TUI hotel very good, however TUI changed our flight to a Smartlynx flight that was rubbish, it was so cramped, I am 5 foot and was so glad had an aisle seat, the 2 TUI staff on board were not the best for customer service, would I go with TUI again, no would I fly with Jet2 again, yes. In fact flying with them again in November.",1
"I will never fly Allegiant again. Was an awful flight there and back. First flight had 3 drunk guys sitting behind us at 9am. Many complaints but flight crew didn't do anything about it. They would rather save 3 than the many who sat around them behind bothered by the yelling and bad language. The flight back was even worse. The people directly behind us had a medium size dog that whined and yelped loudly the entire 2.5 hour trip. The dog was under my seat so it was even louder for me. The owners only were addressed by the crew when they were caught with the dog sitting openly on their lap. Not being bad enough, the dog was also passing gas. One of the requirements listed on Allegiants website is the animal must be ""non disruptive"". This definitely was not the case and the flight crew was not eager to do anything about it. Not to mention that both of us are allergic and were sneezing. I did reach out to Allegiant with my complaint. Their answer was shocking and dismissive to say the least. They pretty much said, in short, that it's my problem and they did nothing wrong. I asked to speak to someone else and I've been brushed off. Again, they are going to lose passengers to save the feelings of two people. This isn't very good business!",0
"An absolute joke. The flight was delayed by 4 hours and after that they decided it was cancelled. Not only did they take ages to decide it was cancelled all other flights to Cyprus had already left and therefore the next available flight from them was on Thursday, nearly a week after. There was no representative at the Airport which I don't know how this is legal, as we had no guidance no nothing. People that needed hotels were never given any validation or any help. They need to rebook us onto the next available flight and they were completely useless. Lots of people lost their holidays just like that. It's funny how easy they will take money off of us for luggages being cm than the allowed dimensions but will not even speak to us when the cancel entire trips. I have never felt so neglected before! The customer service on the phone was also not helpful at all telling us we need to do this online. I have spent money on taxi to and from the airport and which I want compensation for and they never said anything. Absolutely disrespectful. The EU law says that passengers need to be cared for after cancellations which clearly has not happened.",0
My husband and I both fly frequently between Ohio and New York and Florida so this review is based on many flights. Southwest has become my preferred airline. As a senior checking my bags for free means I don't have to lift a bag overhead that is getting increasingly difficult. No change fee means I don't have to buy insurance. The staff are wonderful boarding is done in an efficient way and you can get a convenient and moderately priced flight without having to fly at 5.30am. Would only use another when I have to match a specific time frame that is not available.,1
"My flight was set to leave at 2300 on August 29th and was initially delayed 3 hours but I was not sent an email until 830pm. Lucky I was checking the airport website hours before. Then my flight was cancelled with no other flight offered until Wednesday so I had to book a flight with another airline in the AM and book a hotel. You can't get a hold of anyone to ask questions or get a refund immediately. I am sincerely hoping I get refunded my flight and hotel but something tells me this airline will not do the right thing. This airline leaves passengers stranded with no regard for them at all. Just pay the extra money to fly with someone else, because you're probably going to have to anyways. If I could give Flair a negative rating I most definitely would.  I'm disgusted and will never book with Flair ever again.",0
"Buffalo to Cancun via Philadelphia. After being almost a 2hr delay, with absolutely not weather events and the 35mins circling the sky to land in Philadelphia. My wife and I have upgraded seats. Had 5mins to get through customs and heard the flight to Buffalo, NY was about to close the gates. After running with my military service connected knee and back conditions. And after asking for a ride by an attendant, which we were denied, made to the gate on time. However, the airlines sold our seats to someone else, even though we made it on time. The ticket agents need to have a bit of customer service training. They could not have been more ignorant, especially when I attempted to get it straightened out. I was given a the neck jerk and the hand, while she took our tickets and would give me their names. So, now I am stuck in a hotel when I should be home already. Not only that, the Homeland Security act has given these folks the audacity the act like law enforcement officers. I worked for custom and immigrations for many yrs and have never experienced the ignorant folks you have working for you. I will never fly with American Airlines again.",0
Dakar to Casablanca. Very nice experience! Very satisfied to travel with the Royal Air Maroc. An airline serving its customers. Bravo the RAM. You are the Best!,1
Tel Aviv to Wroclaw. Fantastic flight. The airplane interior was new and fresh. Seats were very comfortable and it was enough space. Food was tasty and prices very affordable. Cabin crew was nice and helpful. There was a little bit delay due to operational reasons. I will use them next time as well.,1
"My wife and I flew Icelandair from Gatwick to Keflavik return on a B757. Both flights were full and on time. We had exit row seats on the outbound flight which I found to be very hard and uncomfortable, on the return we had normal seats which were far better, plenty of leg room for a 3 hour trip. Complementary hot and cold beverages served. A nice touch was the northern lights show played on the cabin roof above the lockers.",1
"Banyuwangi to Jakarta. First time flying on a CRJ1000 on GA's ExploreJet brand and I was surprised at how much leg room there was. I was unfortunate to have picked a seat on one of those awkward rows between two windows so I had to lean forward or crane my neck behind me to look out the window which was disappointing but I blame only my poor luck. The plane was clean and comfortable. Flight attendants were fantastic. For this short domestic flight, we only got a small snack box consisting of bread, an Indonesian rice cake snack called lemper, and the flight attendants served a variety of drinks. All were just enough to fill you but nothing more. There was no IFE. Overall a short but comfortable and pleasant flight.",1
"June 10 2014 LH 493 to Frankfurt. July 3 2014 LH 476 to Vancouver. We paid extra for exit row seats and were not disappointed lots of legroom. Only critique was that people tend to congregate around area for bathrooms which isn't a big deal but when they hang out there for more than half an hour and keep bumping into you while you're trying to sleep then it's annoying. Outgoing flight was 747 and seemed to attract more ""standers"" return flight was 330 and shape of cabin did not encourage people to hang around as much. Pleasantly surprised at number of meals and snacks during both flights lots of variety service was great and flight attendants went out of way to accommodate other passengers with young children. Look forward to flying Lufthansa again hopefully in Premium or Business Class next time.",1
"This airline is the worst, all flights were delayed for about 3 hours and also Eunice one the airline's desk helper in Mexico DF was disrespectful and rude she also said that she had the power to stop us to take our flight back to USA. I will never use Interjet again.",0
"Milan to New York JFK. We were so pleased with our Emirates experience. The lounge at Milan was clean and well appointed and staffed by super efficient and friendly people. Our flight went without a hitch. Lots of leg room, variety of entertainment, and so many food choices. We fly international about 7 times a year and have sworn off Delta. We are so grateful to have found an airline that appreciates their customers.",1
"Wonderful value for the amount paid for ticket. Staff were very attentive. Airplane was immaculate, and everything ran on time. We landed twenty minutes ahead of time.",1
"Just back to Gatwick from Costa Rica and we were impressed by the Boeing 787 and service from Thomson Airways staff, though not by having to pay in order to sit together!. Staff were very attentive on the outgoing flight with similar drinks and food service to scheduled airlines for long haul flights. The meals were slightly smaller but very tasty. Thee seats were comfortable and the cabin was airy. Altogether a good experience and I would definitely fly with Thomson Airways again.",1
I flew from Vienna to Cluj and onward to Bucharest. On the first leg they offered me a large and delicious warm meal. On the second part of the trip they offered me two ham and cheese sandwiches with butter a large milka chocolate caramel bar and two drinks including Romanian beer and wine! Seats were comfortable on both occasions the aircraft arrived on time. Excellent legroom and very friendly crew! Will definitely fly TAROM again.,1
Catania to Verona. Great company. It is always a pleasure to fly whit it. No problem at all. Easy to contact for assistance by social media and very easy to book a flight whit app,1
Flew from Sao Paulo to Santiago de Chile and then five days later from Santiago to La Paz Bolivia via Iquique. Excellent service efficient and friendly cabin crew good food comfortable seats. Excellent!,1
"Los Angeles to Manila via Taipei. The plane was very clean and cabin staff was efficient at getting meals served. I took a total of four flights with EVA Air in February and I felt some stewards attitude was very gruff. They need training on how to ask passengers to do things such as opening and closing the window shade, raising the seat from a recline position. When I am travelling, especially on vacation, I expect courteous service. I was very frustrated with the demeanor. It may be a cultural difference.",0
Myself and partner flew Sydney to Cairns return. From the international terminals we could purchase sandwiches and muffins on the forward trip but they only had Mars bars or crisps on the return trip at 7am in the morning. Pretty ordinary for a 3 hour flight. The seat in economy on the A330 are very tight my knees were on the seat in front flight attendants never smile. Never again.,0
"Always nice to fly with Singapore Airlines. Again had great flights,  enough legroom. Entertaiment was sufficient. Very friendly crew.  Will fly with them again. Seat number 43A and C.",1
"I've read very poor reviews about Spirit. I haven't had difficulty yet. I didn't have any difficulty with checking in, baggage, or boarding. I do have a return flight on Spirit from Orlando. So I guess I just lucked out with the service. The staff were polite, helpful, and friendly at check in and on the flight. So I don't have a bad review so far. I'll update my review, if possible, for the return flight.",1
"Buffalo to Atlanta. Due to the power outage in Atlanta my flight from Buffalo was delayed and then canceled. Then my next day flight was also canceled. The staff at gate 25 were absolutely wonderful answering questions and working like crazy to get everybody on the next available flight with connections that worked for them. They were efficient and more than polite. The level of concern they showed and their willingness to bend over backwards to accommodate the passengers was incredible. They worked quickly but took time to explain questions asked and not make us feel rushed through. I was traveling alone and not being an experienced traveler, I was extremely nervous. But the young lady really made the inconvenience much less scary and went out of her way to show us step by step what was about to happen.  Thank you Delta for your excellent customer service and taking care of your passengers. You really made the best of an unforeseeable event and showed me how important your reputation is to your employees.",1
"Bangkok to Tokyo Haneda. Flying with ANA is always a pleasure as even before boarding the flight you know that the service will be of a very high standard due to Japanese custom of serving the client! Hence, it was no surprise that the flight has outstanding service from the Japanese and some Thai crew. Drinks and food was served in a superb manner, plane was very clean, toilets very super clean and if or whenever you called for service the crew came immediately, spoke with the most respect and promptly served you. This is a wonderful airline which I feel even Singapore Airlines and Cathy cannot match and they are great. However, what really impressed me was how professional the Purser in charge of my section Ms Nagakawa was! I asked a Crew member for a customer form not realising that they would consider this as me being unhappy and raise it to their Purser. Ms Nagakawa came to me and said, ""Sir, you have asked for a customer form, could you give me an outline of what the problem is?"" The way in which she did it and showed concern made me realise what high standards this airline puts in pleasing a client and if the client is unhappy in anyway, they don't speak down to the client like other airlines do, their senior team members come professionally to appease the situation and help the client enjoy their flight. Luckily for her I had good news about how wonderful the flight was. She so politely spoke to me and appreciated it but that was not just it, she continued to maintain high standards by constantly checking on me and personally serving service of a high standard. An absolutely magnificent Purser who led the team by example and I had one of the best flights of my life. My return flight too was superb with high quality service from ANA. I highly recommend this company for safety, service and most important of all the way in which you as a client are respected! Thank you to ANA for employing such wonderful staff like Ms Nagakawa and the other crew as well as setting such high standards",1
"Birmingham to Malaga. We've all seen the online blogs about Ryanair's reputation for avoiding compensation claims, but I experienced it first hand when they cancelled my flight to Mallorca just 6 hours before take off back in October of last year, and I lost a fortune in transfers, hotel costs, train fees, travel money etc. I thought it would be very straight forward to get compensation for something for which I was totally blameless. Not so. I contacted Ryanair with all of my proof of purchases, and got an email to say they would pay me nothing because of circumstances ""which was due to a general strike, outside of our control.""  I contacted the Ombudsman, Aviation ADR, and they contacted Ryanair on my behalf, and received a reply saying that they still would not compensate me. I went higher up and still nothing. I am continuing to fight this. I'm not going to say I will never fly with them again, because they are cheap. But the reputation Ryanair have for abysmal customer service and compensation claims is utterly justified. If you book, make sure you are ATOL protected, because otherwise you will have one mighty battle on your hands.",0
"Loved Norwegian on my flight Oslo to London. It exceeded my expectations for the price. Comfortable seats, free wifi and lovely staff.",1
I'm just back from Malta having flown out and back from London Gatwick. Both flights departed promptly after smooth check in and boarding and arrived on time. Flying Airbus the seats were wider than I have experienced on recent economy flights with other airlines. The staff were friendly and the absence of attempts to sell unwanted items was appreciated. The provided means were pretty average but it was much cheaper to travel with them on my route than with Easyjet where food would have been an extra. I will certainly use them again and it is clear from a number of conversations that they have deservedly won many regular customers among the expat community.,1
On July 3 we were bound for intercontinental flight from SFO to FRA. Departure should be at 2 pm and was announced for 6.45 pm. After some more trouble boarding started at 8.15. After a tour on the airfield the plane came back to starting point. At least we departed with a delay of nearly 8 hours. The gate staff was completely stressed with the amendment of connecting flights for other passengers. No customer voucher were given no telephone calls offered no service at all.,0
"Heathrow to Marseille. Within a few days of booking a flight for December, BA advised flight has been changed to late evening arrival. This is unacceptable so I opt to cancel and full refund. BA then says it is refunding the fare and makes no mention of the fee I have paid for seat selection. I have found a claim form for refund of these fees, on submission they say they will take up to 28 days to think about it.",0
"Overall, another pleasant flying experience with Emirates. All 4 flights on time. IFE is pretty good, so the boys were extremely happy. We have strict Vegetarian diet and the special meal requests were properly delivered on all segments. Kids goodies were pretty high spec. Legroom, service etc in economy class on any Middle East carrier has similar standards. It is the other factors such as flying on time, food, proper receipt of luggage etc that matter for family holidays by air.",1
Detroit to Reno via Denver. United Airlines was the most unorganized airline I have ever flown on. They didn't provide good customer service on or off the ground. We arrived well over 3 hours for a domestic flight and no one kept us informed if we would make the flight or not due to the computer problems they were having and could not print tickets. This is understandable but to pick people who were yelling and causing the most commotion as opposed to calming veryone down letting all passengers know that the flight crew is aware of the problem and no one would be missing their flight. When i would try and ask questions i was dismissed without answers and they were rude.  Leaving the trip had a horrible experience with them as well. Again we allowed ourselves plenty of time especially after our first encounter with them. We again waited in line for hours when we finally approached the desk They only let 2 of us check our bags. The other 2 family members they refused to allow them on and had them fly out later that night. I have never encountered such an uncompassionate and unorginized company. I will never fly them again even if the flight is free.,0
"Never again Delta. Today I arrived at PWM at 5am for my 6.30 flight. The Flight was delayed for fog in NY, not a problem I wasn't in a rush to get to CLE but just needed to get there hopefully by 5pm and even later would have been ok. Delay after delay after delay after delay came and went. They called me up and said that the connecting flight was in jeopardy but that they might make up time in the air and I might be ok, but they offered me a alternative to go to Detroit and then to Cleveland on a later flight, said they would put me on it and I could decide before the boarding of the one that might be late into NY. I said ok, fine. 2 minutes later they said they couldn't get me that because someone took the seat they had for me and it was the last one. OK, I figure well, at least I get to New York and surely Delta will get me to Cleveland, both being large cities. So the original flight delays more and more and they they find me again and say...we know you have been here for a very long time Sir, but we can't get you to Cleveland today""? What an epic failure for a supposedly professional company, a large carrier, the kind someone might book with and book first class because they are known as a reliable company! Don't be fooled, they are none of that if they cannot get a passenger to a city like Cleveland Ohio on a day they ticket you for. Not a holiday, not a busy time of year, nope, just a bungling company with terrible service that can't deliver on their service. This day cost me two uber riders to and from my home, it cost me food all day while I waited and waited being promised time and time again the flight would be leaving, I think a total of 6 times before I was told to take a hike because I wasn't making my trip today, I was told I could book with another airline and that they were out at this point. I could get a refund for my unfulfilled ticket by Delta. Of course when I asked that would my having to rebook on another airline today at a hugely inflated last minute ticket, would they include that on my refund, they were not taking any responsibility for that. Just go away sir and have a nice day. The only thing that went well at all, was the refund person that answered the phone in a reasonable amount of time and was very nice while quickly refunding my card. So apparently they do well at refunds, likely due to lots of practice! I always thought Delta was one of the top dogs in the industry, I mean I would have not been surprised if they were a small company like Elite, Spirit or Frontier, but Delta? They can't fix a screw up delay to a city like Cleveland? So I had to go home and not make a trip to do business for a couple of days because I chose a company like Delta, because I chose to trust my flight need to Delta. What a mistake, one that I will never make again.",0
"Out of 5 flights with this airline in recent months, 4 were delayed more than 1 hour, 1 was cancelled. Lesson learned. Never again unless unavoidable. The cabin interiors seem super worn, but that's the least of their many many problems. Take AirAsia instead if you can. Way better on time performance in my experience.",0
Jetstar Asia was extremely bad. Flight was cancelled due to volcano while every other airline was still flying to Singapore except Jetstar. There was only 1 person at the airport from Jetstar. The option they gave was to book another ticket from an other airline and we could get our money back at Singapore? The site was good for making a booking.,0
"We flew Scoot on the 23 November 2014 Sydney to Singapore and were very happy with the flight and service. The meal provided was OK. Captain had a good sense of humour ""We are going to Scoot off now"". We would defiantly fly Scoot again.",1
"San Francisco to Barcelona. Booked premium class travel in September 2019 for departure in December. A week before departure they call me to tell me the reservation actually did not book, even though they charge my credit card. Offered two alternative flights that would both delay our arrival to Barcelona by more than 12 hours and require at least 3 stopovers. 12 hours later they have yet to confirm the charged schedule. In short look elsewhere. No need to risk your travel plans with his airline as all they will do is take your money and ignore the reservation.",0
"London to Mumbai with Jet Airways, and the seating in economy class, especially for such a long haul flight, is diabolical. The seats are extremely narrow, even for a slim person and the leg room is so cramped. The pocket flap in front of the seat is so tight, one can just about store a few papers. One is constantly disturbed by the passenger in the next seat as there is really no room to keep both arms on the arm rests without touching the other person. Really diabolical experience seating wise on such a long haul flight. At the same time, fares are among the most expensive.",0
We have always used SAS and been loyal customers. Previously SAS had had the best in airline customer service from our experience. Our latest experience from Atlanta to Oslo was terrible and resulted in us being forced to cancel our flight with several thousand dollars being held by SAS right before Christmas. The problem is that SAS had sold out and exported their customer service dept to a third world nation where the reps do not even speak legible English nor do they care about the concerns of customers. Particularly American customers. SAS has done a great disservice their customers and also to the competent Scandinavian people by exporting their jobs for profit. I suppose it should no longer be called Scandinavian.,0
Miami to Chicago. If you have any other options for an airline use it. This hands down the worst airline I have ever spent real people money on. I suggest you build a kite large enough to carry you before booking with them.,0
Calgary to Toronto. Previously I would chase Aeroplan miles and exclusively book Air Canada for business travel. On this recent trip I softened my view and booked WestJet. It will be the last time I do. I used to have a high opinion of WestJet and their customer service.. Somewhere along the way they devolved into the worst nickel and dime company with more service fees and charges than I've ever experienced in all my years of flying. I have no plans to use them again moving forward.,0
"Bologna to Cologne. Just awful, boarding started on time but they let the people wait in the corridor for about 30 minutes before they could actually enter the aircraft. Boarding took very long and you couldn't change your seat, which was very uncomfy and didn't felt right sitting in. Staff was ok but not allow to change seats. During the flight there were lots announcements about buying which really annoyed. Deboarding was also very slow.",0
"Lisbon to Dubai. Emirates is going worse and worse, service is not great, food is horrible and really small portions. In an  8hour flight we get only a small meal and a mini snack. We pay a lot for a flight that is not by far good, the staff is more worried to take care of family flying on same airplane, than with other passengers. IFE screens sometimes are not working. Wifi inside, it should last 2h for free, I had 5 minutes, and couldn't connect any more.",0
Bangkok to London. Seating and interior old with a very small IFE screen. I did not like the meals. Had a short connection and i was rebooked from another partner. Upon arrival in LHR others for the same connecting flight were awaited but not me. I was told there would be service agents in purple everywhere but I found none. The fast track security was non existant. Total experience was bad.,0
"Vueling Airlines was the worst nightmare. My suitcase didn't arrive to Barcelona. All they gave me after hours of waiting was a small torn paper with the information I gave them, and the last paragraph saying that they don't take any responsibility. When I ask them what are my rights, they simply said we will look for your suitcase. Aftet 3 nights I return to the airport, they were totally unfriendly, said they did not know where it is. Lets see what will happen.",0
"Luton to Larnaca. The staff at Luton Airport were rude, pushy and downright unprofessional. There was a delay at both airports with no explanation and no apology. The prices charged for 10kg or 20kg luggage are extortionate and make the overall trip very expensive compared to other airlines doing the same route.",0
"My first flight was delayed by 45 minutes with no explanation. Fine, that's not terrible. But on the flight I was an idiot and left my purse behind. That's on me. But trying to get a hold of anyone has been a nightmare. First time I was on hold for an hour and thirty minutes. And they said we're basically closed for the day, nothing has been turned in, call back on Monday. Monday I was on hold for two hours before I had to give up. Eventually drove to the airport because I was upset, they said they have nothing. Which essentially means it was stolen. Which is pretty upsetting. So I am currently on hold again to double check, its been 1 hour and 44 minutes so far. Oh yeah, and on my flight home they delayed the flight three times, without sending us a single email.",0
San Jose to Vancouver via Seattle. The Alaska Airlines agent was amazing! Our flight was cancelled and she went above and beyond to rebook us and get a direct flight to Vancouver from San Fran. She could have easily brushed us off but chose to go the extra mile to make sure our vacation wasn't disrupted. We will definitely book with Alaska Airlines in the future. Thanks so much!,1
Absolutely terrible experience. I recommend everyone avoid Allegiant at all cost. Allegiant canceled our flight with no rescheduled flight for 4 days. We rented a car and drove 3 other people from our flight home. After a month of trying to reach out to Allegiant I had to Facebook message them to get a response! They are not reimbursing us for the cost of the car and only providing a voucher for the flight instead of a reimbursement. Customer service staff were terrible.,0
"We had an exceptional flight with Thomas Cook Airlines from Orlando to Manchester. My girlfriend and I flew premium economy, which was well worth the money for the extra legroom. The plane was very modern which great entertainment options built into the seat in front of you. Flight crew was very pleasant and the food was even better. Drinks were all complimentary and they had an excellent selection of premium beverages. I was very surprised by what a great flight we had and will definitely recommend Thomas Cook to our family and friends.",1
"Flew Southwest Airlines from Houston, Texas to Cabo San Lucas, Mexico. This review is for the employees at the customer service desk in the boarding area. I had lost my passport and was about to board, and 4 people immediately jumped to help solve my problem. They pulled my bags off my boarding flight to Mexico immediately and made sure I was able to get my bags. They than proceeded to do everything possible to contact the airports I was previously at and talk with their lost and found to see if my passport had been found. They gave me all the information for me to obtain a new passport in Downton Houston to fly out to Mexico the next morning! Couldn't of asked for a better turn of events.",1
We recently flew from Chicago to Istanbul to Tel Aviv. The experience was very positive but where Turkish Airlines really stood out was in providing gluten free meals. They were of excellent quality and out of four major meals there were no repeats. Really beat the standard white rice and dry white chicken most airlines serve every time. It helped make a long trip easier.,1
Worst experience of my life. Never felt this unvalued. Flight delayed by 16 hours. Hotel only given for 6 hours which was 1 hr away from the airport and had to apply for a Turkish visa in order to get to the hotel. Spent 50 pounds extra on top of out flight and food for 16 hour delay. People at the airport not helpful what so ever. Turkish Airlines kept giving mixed messages and canceled our flight even when the flight was still going. Rude people with bad cabin crew service. 7 hour flight and the hostess kept turning my light off whenever I called for assistance.,0
This flight was cancelled by Aegean and I am still waiting for my refund.  Where is my money?,0
"Athens to Milano. I think that Aegean has a very good economy class product for short haul flights within Europe. Seat is quite comfortable and since you can book your seat 48hrs in advance using the echeckin services, you can select an emergency exit row free of charge. Lot of other airlines will charge you with 15 to 20 euros for such a seat. Then it is one of the few airlines which still serve a hot meal. For the flight between Athens to Milano other companies serve a cold sandwich. We have been served a hot breakfast plus yougurt with honey, juices and coffee. Plane departed with 15 minutes delay but we arrived on time",1
"ZB648 2nd July and ZB649 7th July. Return flight with to Larnaca. Good points flights on time and UK bag drop was quick and easy. Bad points was not impressed with the service not one single member of staff spoke to us. Very budget airline ok for a 2 hr flight but not for anything longer. The seats were very uncomfortable and no entertainment of any sort provided. Check in process at Larnaca airport was a farce and took over an hour just to drop bags as we had already checked in online to ""speed up"" the process. I spoke to a member of staff at the airport about poor service and was ignored I have since emailed them and again have been ignored.",0
"As with a lot of people never heard of Small Planet Airlines so was a bit apprehensive but let me tell anybody who is flying with them there is no need to worry. Modern, clean aircraft, friendly, hard working staff. A very pleasant experience.",1
"Flight 866 from Los Angeles to Dallas Forth Worth was supposed to depart at 10.19, it was delayed until 12.39. We were not informed of our delay. I checked with Spirit about an hour after our supposed departure and agent informed us of the delay. Asked why this was not announced, he said that it would be done after the previous flight departs. I was told the reason for the delay was crew shortage, this is unbelievable that such a huge airline does not have accommodation for crew shortage.",0
"Delhi to Varanasi. Absolute nightmare, flight delayed by 3 hours after the boarding call. Crew took no responsibility, no communication after the initial call for passengers to be seated.",0
On 21st August this year my wife and I were to fly United from Heathrow to Chicago and booked in early July. As soon as online check in opened I found that only five seats were left which meant that we were to be separated during the flight. How were all the rest allocated before the 24hr opening time? The night before we were due to fly out I received a text message to say that the flight was cancelled. Whilst on route to LHR a text arrived telling us to check in as normal. At the United desk we were told that we would be bussed to a hotel for the night. The best compensation they could offer was Economy Plus instead of our Economy seats. On the flight out the food was appalling. Drinks were served from jugs carried down the gangways in a very unprofessional style by very unprofessional stewardesses. After arrival at Chicago we thought our problems were over. Whilst in Washington we went to Dulles Airport to see a United Supervisor to ensure that we could sit together on the return flight on 11th September. The system would not allow her to print boarding cards with seat allocations more than 24hrs before departure but she printed some boarding cards and wrote the seat numbers on the cards. For the return journey we arrived in good time at Chicago checked in and boarded the aircraft on time to find that we had been given Economy Plus seats. Start up time came and went and then an announcement was made that an electrical fault existed. We waited eventually after a delay of approx. 1.5 hours we were off back to Blighty. The flight through the night was unpleasant due to the aircraft being very cold which made sleeping almost impossible. Altogether not a very good experience.,0
"Flight left gate 13 minutes early, I was at gate 20 minutes early they did not give my refund back but issue me a airline voucher good for one year. I am never going to fly this airline again, I have to rent a car with my family to drive 16 hours from Bellingham WA to Oakland, there are no phone numbers to call no one at checkin counters, no one answers my email. Please pay extra to another airline if you love your life.",0
"Inconvenient is the word I would use to describe my experience with booking with Frontier Airlines. Replacing by the phone customer service with online ""chat bot"" that doesn't work should be illegal. Quit playing with peoples money.",0
Stansted to Athens. Being assigned separate seats at check in time and forced to pay for changing your seat is just ridiculous. This is a whole new level of low.  I've been a loyal Ryanair customer for almost 10 years but enough is enough!,0
"My boyfriend and I book a trip to Dublin only to get to the airport and was told the flight was cancelled. The manager said the next flight was the following day at 9.45pm. When passengers started asking to be put on another flight he said there were too many of us he said there was nothing he could do and finally shouted ""I am not going to answer anymore questions the flight is cancelled and that is that"". We cancelled the flight and booked another airline that same day.",0
"Copenhagen to London. Super slow, had to wait for buses which were delayed. Also packed the buses to tight with people. Where too far from arrival terminals. Service bad from staff. Coming to Terminal 5 is the worst terminal on Heathrow. The food and beverage on board was terrible for the price. For the price of the airline ticket the whole experience was way below expected service and time of staff.",0
"Denver to Orlando. This is by far the worst airline I have used. They must receive hand down airplanes because 3 times, not once or twice but three times my flight was delayed or canceled. First flight was from colorado springs to Chicago and they delayed the flight for 2 hours and eventually canceled the flight. Again from Denver to Orlando it was delayed 2 hours. Then Orlando to Denver the flight was canceled for mechanical issues but when they knew about the cancellation a day ahead and didnt let anyone know until we were at the ticket counter with the rest of the people for the flight. They canceled it and we couldn't leave for another 2 days.",0
"This has got to be the worst customer service experience I have ever had with a company. I booked my flight and then 2 days later they cancelled it without even telling me directly. They then said that I could not get my money back. Fast forward two months and they send out a broken refund form that cannot be filled out as it required a rewards ID that I don't have because I never signed up for their rewards program. I reached out to their customer service team and received no answer, for two months. Where are you WestJet? Are you enjoying my money? In all seriousness I strongly recommend that you look at another airline for your travel plans. WestJet is not a professional company and I will never be using their services again. There is no acceptable reason for a digital refund to take ""up to 6 months"" as WestJet says.",0
"I've bought a return ticket from them 12th April depart, 14th April return. They cancelled the departing flight 5 days prior, the next day I got an email says that they have rescheduled my departing flight to 14th April without my consent. That makes my itinerary like departing in the morning, stay at the destination for 30minutes then returning on the same day!? I lodged a case for refund with AirAsia thru their online chat bot, as I couldn't contact any of their customer service staff. My case status was closed by AirAsia, and I haven't get my refund back. I went to the airport to check with their counter staff, they said AirAsia have refunded me. I checked with my bank, and there are not a single dime from AirAsia.  There are no way to contact their person in charge for refund. The boarding counter staffs tell you to lodge your case online with the chatbot. You can spend 2 hours and get nowhere there.",0
"I flew Qantas Sydney to Melbourne return. The flights were punctual. The service was calm, efficient and friendly. The meals in Business were hot and delicious. It looks like Qantas is back to its old self after the COVID disruption. Well done.",1
"I had the best customer service experience! I dealt with Christine in the Seattle branch and she was expremely helpful, very professional, cheerful and informative. Thank you Christine for having such wonderful customer service skills and cheerful disposition! Totally made my day and makes me feel comfortable having my children fly without me for the first time. You are a wonderful representative for the airline they're lucky to have you!",1
"United airlines is by far the most insensitive airline I have ever taken. I have a service animal and requested a window seat months ago to which they said none were available after guaranteeing me the seat when I first booked my flight. Besides this, the process for taking a service dog on their airline is so complex and takes 48 hours to process I almost was unable to assure my service animal could accompany me. By paying for a flight I got nothing but greif and felt shamed by customer service for having a service animal. If anyone from United airlines actually reads this please know I will never be taking one of your aircraft ever again. ",0
"Cebu to Caticlan. I booked premium economy and was downgraded to economy. There was no refund offered. When I asked the flight attendant I was told I did not book premium economy, complained last July 11 and all I got was promised if they will contact the officer in charge. Kept following up but the same response to wait for the person in charge to reply via email. Customer service is terrible!",0
Flight WG514 on Jan 8 2014. Delayed 8 hours then we were stuck on the plane for 3 hours prior to take off. Airline attendants would not help anyone. They were very unprofessional. Then when we landed we were stuck on the plane for another hour. They wouldn't let anyone use the bathroom while were stuck sitting there. No one at the luggage area to tell people what was going on. Didn't give out forms in line so prolonged the line as people were standing at the desk filling out form instead of doing it ahead of time. Then our luggage didn't arrive. When we finally got a hold of someone they said we would get our luggage on Sat or Sunday but it never came.,0
Flew to Dubai from Heathrow not flown Virgin for over 3 years and was painfully reminded why I no longer fly Virgin. Old tatty plane poor food and an entertainment system from the dark ages that didn't work for many. The marketing is great for them but the delivery of the service is dreadful couldn't understand why the staff were just so rude and plain unhelpful sadly a week later returned and the same plane and same issues. Virgin used to be so good.,0
"The flight was excellent. I was wowed by the entertainment system SriLankan Airlines has upgraded to with new modern, responsive HD screens with good entertainment collections. Well maintained aircraft. Food was great and service was efficient. One gesture I liked was staff offering water before takeoff to all passengers seated. Overall great hospitality and service.",1
"Upon arriving at the gate for a 33 minute in air flight, I observed another flight that was canceled with a long line of people waiting at customer service. Just then, my flight was delayed due to the absence of the flight crew. We then switched planes and gates to a larger plane to accommodate yet another canceled flight from the day before. We finally boarded with a flight crew, but after the doors were closed, we were deplaned since the crew ran out of hours. This was not an issue with the airport or with the crew, but rather with the scheduling of American airlines flights and not accounting for weather or maintenance or other imminent delays. With so many choices, why anyone would choose American Airlines after seeing hundreds of people canceled without refunds, without food vouchers, and without hotels all trying to sleep in the airport that had no open businesses this time of day is beyond me. American Airlines should be closed due to poor business practices.",0
"Wuhan to San Francisco.  The flight was on time departed. The aircraft is quite new. The food service was excellent, and cabin service was thoughtful and just right. The ground staff in San Francisco was efficient and easy going. I got my luggage in priority baggage area as soon as I went thought the custom.",1
"Toronto to Athens. Booked Lufthansa but somehow it was an Air Canada rouge flight. The staff were very nice. I am a 5'8"" female and my knees were touching the seat in front of me. The entertainment is access to the Rouge app. If you do not bring a laptop with earbuds, you can rent one from Rouge. Glad I brought my kindle. The meal was rubber chicken with a mix of potatoes, carrots and beans. The salad was a very poor version of potato salad. Great for potato lovers. This was not a bargain flight for me.",0
"A very comfortable flight from Colombo to London Heathrow. I wasn't feeling particularly well which one of the cabin crew noticed and made sure I was well hydrated and had food that I wanted. The new business class seat is very comfortable, although slightly confusing in what positions you can achieve. I spent a while trying to understand what positions I could get myself into.",1
"MH 148 from Melbourne to KL. Check in most efficient and guided to express lane for security and passport clearance. MAS use the Qantas lounge which is a bunker at Melbourne but nice food and drinks on offer. Slight boarding delay as some passengers were paged by the gate staff on a number of times. Upon boarding shown to my seat in 6 A and assured by the excellent cabin manager that my ""book the cook"" meal was on board. Welcome drink offered however no champagne. I asked for a glass if possible and it was delivered in a prompt manner. After take off a cold towel was handed out and then one of the highlights of this airline the satay was served! Next came a Terrine as a starter followed by my lunch which I had pre ordered. A prawn and noodle dish which was one of the best meals I have enjoyed in over 40 years of flying internationally! The wine list was very good and also the ""if your hungry"" menu was also great! The service and the staff on board were brilliant and answered the call button within seconds. Movies were limited but enough to keep me going for the 8 hour flight. Overall for the price and the great crew this flight I rate in my top 3 of all time.",1
"Atlanta to Ft Lauderdale. Spirit Airlines is the worst airline, they didn't have a flight attendant show up. It absolutely wrecked my plans and cost me a ton of money. Never book Spirit Airlines, go with anybody else instead.",0
I travelled from Singapore to Berlin on Scoot. It was a long haul flight and was able to get some sleep. Arrived in TXL and was bused to the annex of airport.,1
I'm sitting at the airport waiting for rouge 1849 to leave. It was supposed to leave at 6.20 its now 7.15 and everybody is milling around the Rouge desk waiting to see what will happen. Typical AC.,0
"This is the worst trip by far. Trip delayed for two hours for unknown reasons and the captain miscommunicated the duration of the flight that took 4 hours and a half instead of the usual 3 hours and a half. Chairs are broken and filthy and very small. Apart from a friendly attendants, it was the worst experience for me and my family and never again.",0
"Copenhagen to London. Checked in 2 bags, 1 arrived other did not. I was told it might arrive on the next flight. But no reference number was given initially by GBS at London and the contact details give of SAS were wrong, even though they were printed on a SAS letterhead. It took us 12 hours to manage to speak to some one at the airline in Denmark and they said they dont handle lost baggage. On the 3rd day we returned to CPH with one bag and the other not to be found. Finally some one from the airline spoke and said it might get found might not and that the airline is more concerned about getting people on the planes on time rather than find lost baggage. He also said we cannot contact anyone from the airline and they will only contact us. Im left helpless with no clue about baggage and I've written to the airline on the feedback email ID but no response, even no response after posting on there twitter. I have not seen such poor service in any sector in any airline in any country.",0
"Cancelled my flight and called to try to get a refund due to a death in my family and they did not want to give me a refund. They told me I only get the credit. I won't be using the credit and definitely not Spirit Airlines again, I work in the hospitality industry and I know the difference of when to make an exception.",0
"Still apparent that Virgin Australia are running ghost flights, flight cancelled at 1am with no explanation. Only option to fly via Brisbane to get to Melbourne 8 hours later. Missed a family funeral but as expected offshore call centre has no appreciation of this concern. Virgin very much a budget airline once again.",0
"We have been loyal WestJet customers for years, having a WestJet credit card and loyally collecting points for a long time. I've had delays before , usually the delay is leaving from Abbotsford to Calgary, but never like this. We were delayed 4 hours out of Abbotsford with the excuse of weather being the cause, yes it was cold but not storming and not the coldest weather we've ever had either, in Abbotsford or Calgary, but that was the excuse. We were not able to use the bathroom in flight because it was full of septic, not able to empty it in Abbotsford! Once we landed in Calgary we were stuck on the tarmac for 90 minutes, the pilot told us they didn't have enough ground crew working to bring the plane into a gate. This caused us to miss our connection to Saskatoon by 30 minutes. WestJet customer service counter at 1145pm was a 3 hour wait only to tell us very rudely we didn't qualify for a hotel because our flight was delayed because of weather when clearly the pilot told us the opposite was true. Calgary airport doesn't have any food service open after midnight which also added to the frustration. Westjet also lost our baggage going out to Abbotsford for 2 days. So disappointed in Westjet.",0
This airline is not punctual. Do not trust Spirit Airlines to get you anywhere on time. It does not care about its customers. It is better to spend more money with an airline company that will get you to your destination on time and that offers adequate leg room and quality customer care.,0
Flew to Cancun in early December from NYC. To return to NYC we arrived at the airport in Cancun more than 2 hours before flight to find the United service desks in complete chaos. The line to check in stretched the entire length of the airport. No one was sure if they were on the right line as the signage was very confusing. No other airline had such problems. Very stressful and unpleasant. Will not fly United to Cancun again.,0
"Stansted to Brindisi. Since more or less 6 months Ryanair say that if you want to have your baggage with you, you must a priority fee. This fee suppose to allow you to pass for first At the moment that you show your ticket. In the flight that I took yesterday this didn't happened, many people without priority passed before of me and this is something really unacceptable, doesnt make sense to pay something if after you cant have the service that you are paying for, i know for sure 2 people that passed before me and that are been relocated to the priority, even if they dont have it, and i guess that someone else is passed as well. Very very disappointed.",0
"We were late leaving Barcelona to France but we were not asked if we had a connection, other customers were and moved so they could get off first. They only had about 6 officers in passport control out of around 300 people waiting. Boarding the bus to the terminal for our connecting flight the bus stopped and waited, there was no one. We missed our flight and no one would even help us, we were led in a mouse maze where the employees were rude and wouldn't give us a hotel. I will never recommend Air France to anyone.",0
"Hanoi to Nha Trang. Very good airline, from the airport to the cabin. The cabin crew were friendly and hard working. The food was good for a 2 hours flight. Good legroom, fast service. Check in was quick.",1
"Airline to be avoided, if there is a problem they do not provide a solution. The plane could not land in Bilbao due to weather conditions, for some passengers it was the second time this happened to them within 24 hours. Vueling knew about the weather conditions but they decided to fly anyway, to try their best. When the plane could not land we returned to Barcelona. They left people waiting during more than an hour in a queue for a solution. Some passengers that have meetings in Bilbao were advised to just cancel their tickets through the app and book a new one. Their solution 0. After more than an hour queueing they provided boarding passes for flight after 9 or 14 hours if you were lucky, this was depending on when you book the flight.",0
I find it very disappointing that an airline can allow you to purchase a ticket but cant provide the service. This is the second time I've encountered severely poor service from United airlines not only did I not make it to my destination today they tried to accommodate me to stay in a state that was not part of my itinerary nor my destination. I will never use this airline again and hopefully if anyone's reading this review you won't either.,0
"London to Glasgow. BA customer service is unquestionably the least helpful, least accommodating, least friendly and least responsive so called service available. They clearly train their staff in the multitude of ways to frustrate their customers. I will try to avoid this airline from this point on.",0
"Faro to Zurich via Lisbon. My flight from Faro to Lisbon on 4th December 2018 was delayed. In consequence, I missed my flight on the same day from Lisbon to Geneva on the same day and had to stay in Lisbon until the 5th of December. I missed a full day of work and had other costs resulting from this delay. On receiving my baggage on the 5th of December in Geneva I noticed that my bag was torn open. Since this incidence 8 months I have sent multiple complaints by email, whereby I attached all the necessary documents and pictures. In addition I have called at least 5 times to inquire about the status of my complaint. Each time I was asked to be patient. My patience has run out.I have encountered many problems in relation to flying but never filed a complaint. I have been consistently ignored by TAP for the last 8 months in a case which is absolutely clear. If you fly TAP do not expect any kind of compensation if something does not go well.",0
I've flown Frontier numerous times and never had a problem except once my luggage was on a later flight. Minor inconvenience and it was returned to me at 2am the next morning. It happens with any airline. The staff have always been friendly and attentive. I guess there's always a first time but I still plan to fly with Frontier.,1
Frontier has no support I tried to change my departure date and there is no number to call and their online chatbots could not reschedule my flight. I will NEVER do business with them again and I will tell all my clients to never do business with them.,0
I flew with AirAsia from Phonm Penh to Phuket via Bangkok and nothing positive to say about this airline. Seating with minimal leg room and they charge for water. The inside of the aircraft is plastered with advertising for one brand of jeans or another. There is no lumbar support in the seats and for tall people the headrest is in the middle of your back. The extra charges apply to everything and baggage is expensive. By the time you add in all of the extras might as well fly with a full far carrier. I will never fly again.,0
"Dhaka to Kuala Lumpur via Singapore. I flew Singapore Airlines with my spouse from Dhaka to Kuala Lumpur via Singapore. We had booked the tickets around 3 months ahead which allowed us to get them at unimaginably cheap price. So given the overall quality of service we received was great bang for buck. We loved the interior which had nice Christmas decorations. The legroom was sufficient for an economy seat. The food on the menu was better than what I have had on most flights. The cabin crew were extremely polite and helpful. Our takeoff was slightly delayed due to issues with airport and I was afraid we will miss the connecting flight from Singapore. However, we were allowed to board the flight at Singapore even though we were 5 minutes late and the last passengers in! So they were basically waiting for us. I was very satisfied with the experience and I would love to fly again.",1
Round Trip Newark to Denver. All flights on time. Boarded with A group. Completely uneventful and not exciting flights. Cheapest air fare and bags free is a big plus. All in all a quality experience if bland.,1
I travelled from Amsterdam on Monday the boarding was a nightmare. The gate they use H4 has 10 seats for a full plane of 180 people. We had to stand in this small confined place with little air conditioning for 50 minutes. Several elderly people looked very distressed . I love Easyjet but I would never ever travel with them on this route again. I suppose the airport gives budget airlines the worst gates. I was told this is always the gate for UK flights. Not easyjets fault but a nightmare nevertheless.,0
An awful experience from New Delhi to Lagos. No proper arrangement for entertainment seats are small and uncomfortable. Staff did not respond to call buttons. I will not recommend this airline.,0
Indore to Delhi. When we arrived at Delhi airport our bag was not received on the belt which was a shock for us as it had all stuff as I was in Indore for more than a month so carried everything along with me. Even after dropping them mails several time didn't receive any proper response. After 21 days of lost baggage they are paying us with just Rs 2450 which is less than the price of my empty bag. This is completely disgusting. Will never travel Jet Airways again.,0
"Poor, poor, poor. First of all we had a rude check in for our flight from Gatwick to Barcelona, we then had a 3 hour delay with no explanation and then had rude inflight staff. Room onboard is just ridiculous. If you are tall, or on the larger side, forget it. No welcome onto the aircraft or apology for 3 hour delay. Staff were too busy talking amongst each other. Staff rude throughout whole flight. No smiles. I will never fly with Vueling Airlines again. Flights were cheapish but I would rather have paid double and flown comfortably ensuring a good start to our holiday.",0
"Mauritius to Chennai. Since the plane was overbooked, I was upgraded to business class. My first notion on the journey was that it would be a hectic journey as I has to travel overnight. But the attendants onboard the aircraft made sure to keep me as comfortable as possible. The seats were excellent, cabin service was outstanding. Staff was well trained, polite and professional. I would recommend flying in the business class on this airline.",1
"Flew Fort Lauderdale to New York City. Spirit charges extra for everything! Baggage charges are especially cumbersome and expensive! Their website is very hard to navigate! Customer service is horrible! They entice you with low fares but beware of the premium charges for baggage, etc!",0
"Recently had an excellent Singapore Airlines flight from Sydney to Singapore. Having missed my scheduled morning flight Virgin Velocity and SIA were helpful in getting me on at short notice on the next flight. Being quite tall, I was allocated a row of 4 to myself in the back cabin. Flight was very smooth and I managed several hours of undisturbed sleep. Food and drinks also fine compared to Qantas these days. Smooth landing and quick luggage off at Changi, though the plane was fairly empty.",1
"Melbourne to Rome via Doha. I would like to praise the excellent customer service I received from an agent at the desk at Melbourne Airport. He went out of his way to assist me and after a long stressful day, and  his professionalism courtesy and passion for his position was reflected in his treatment of me.",1
"Guangzhou to Auckland. The cabin crew is very effective and enthusiastic. They smile and try their best to meet my demands.  The food was delicious and has kind of food for me to select. The seat of business class has enough space, so that I can sleep well on the plane. This trip is excellent, and China Southern Airlines is quite good.",1
"This flight was surprise for me. I flew with Brussel Airlines from Brussel to Milano with Sukhoj Superjet 100, the operator was Cityjet. The airplane was new and the seat comfortable. The crew was also very nice. This was early morning flight so during the flight almost everybody fell asleep. The flight was smooth and on time. I would like to fly with them again.",1
I flew from Paris to Johannesburg in March. The weather was very poor however the flight was not delayed because of it we were boarded and then sat on the plane for 4 hours with nothing happening. The only reason given at the time was that the luggage had not arrived at the aircraft but we had no idea how long it was likely to be. As a result I missed a connecting flight. I will never consider flying with them again.,0
"Emirates services are getting worse day by day, I had my flight from Dubai to New York where i had my connecting flight for Nassau, which they changed the time and destination to Newark. The bag drop counter was closed, so I had to take all my luggage to the counter of JetBlue to checkin. When I reached Jet blue the attendants were not helpful at all said the counter is closed and my flight departure times has been changed from 7am to 10am. And they are unable to take my luggage and won't provide any accommodations that I should take my complaints to emirates counter. Emirates ground staff refused to help said I should contact customer service. As I did not have a USA number I had to use my roaming services to call Emirates customer service, after 45 mins being on call i was told that they cannot help and I need to contact ground staff of Emirates. When I went back to Emirates ground staff they said they can't do anything as it was their closing time. Not to mention my flight from Ewr to Nassau also kept getting delayed. I was stranded at the airport as I was not able to arrange a hotel because by the time I could finish all this run around and phone calls it was almost midnight. The only option to eat was dunkin donuts. Worst part was both Jetblue which was affiliated with Emirates and staff of Emirates did not showed any regrets. They cared less if I was being helped or directed. I bought my ticket from the website of Emirates and this was my worst experience ever. I will always avoid flying with this airline.",0
"I would like to thank the cabin crew on the flight from Kolkata to Dubai. We were travelling with 2 toddlers from our family vacation. Toddlers were restless during the flight and disturbing other passengers. The Cabin crew were very considerate, understanding our situation and trying their best to manage the situation. Emily, the air hostess even entertained and kept my son occupied for a while to calm his energy down.",1
"Singapore to Brisbane and Qantas customer service is very poor. The food is dreadful, most of what we ate should not be served to customers. The cabin staff mocked us when we brought this to their attention. Having taken five flights with Emirates in December 2015, we had become accustomed to their excellent service, food and cabin comfort. Flying with Qantas from Singapore to Brisbane was one of the longest seven or so hours of my life. The cabin staff were arrogant, disinterested and in denial regarding the food quality. When I called Qantas the next day to complain they could not care less, a real waste of time. I always think a good test of the quality of any company is how they deal with customer issues, Qantas were very poor in this area. ",0
"Santiago to Sao Paolo. Absolute disaster. We were delayed in Santiago due to crew not being on time arriving 40 min late. Then in flight we requested to be assisted for notifying SAA of delay and priority disembarkment.  At Sao Paolo ground crew took 20 mins to open the plane door.  No assistance from there, no notification to anyone in Sao Paulo. We missed our flight to Johannesburg. When requesting a letter from confirmation of delay, not even any offer for accomodation. LATAM staff didn't even bother to find out why the plane was delayed. The worst airline I have ever used by far. LATAM are incompetent and cannot accomodate international travelers. Their staff has no clue of how to treat clients and assist. For example the captain does an anouncement about a delay without even repeating it in English. It was the most selfish crew and if I had to choose will never fly with LATAM again.",0
Los Angeles to Dallas Ft Worth. It is a real pity to watch one of the old mainline US carriers continue to fall to new lows. The aircraft broke down and needed to be replaced. The flight was the best part of 5 hours late. Inflight service and ground handling was ordinary. Once upon a time America lead the world with customer service. American Airlines staff seemed to be so demotivated that they really have little interest in their customers. The whole lack of a service culture seems to filter through the airline. They just don't care. This happens far too often and they risk long term customers like me moving their business elsewhere.,0
"Bangalore to New Delhi with Vistara, and I was travelling with my husband. We had booked the tickets on premium economy, but to our surprise we were bumped up to business class. I have to say this it is one of the best airlines in India. I was quite impressed by their service, on the ground and in the air. Too bad they don't have a lounge yet.",1
"Sao Paulo to Panama City. Food terrible, entertainment system outdated and terrible. Service lacking and staff attitude terrible. The seats are not comfortable for a 7 hour flight. Plane was clean, as it should be. Boarding was later than announced, delaying departure and arrival.",0
There was no one at check it in Kiev. I couldnt check in and I missed the flight! I asked the passenger handling at the airport and they did nothing! Never fly with them!,0
"The flight from LA to the final destination Dumaguete via Manila was actually relatively pain free. Seats are uncomfortable after a few hours especially when you are 6 foot plus like myself. Food was borderline comparable to just about any experience you've had in your life when you wish you didn't eat something but I believe just about all airlines serve bad meals.  My first major complaint with Philippine Airlines is the cost to check bags. The two bags I checked from LA to Manila were free. Checking the same two bags plus the two my wife had resulted in a 200 dollar fee for the relatively short flight from MNL to Dumaguete. That domestic flight wasn't even half full so not sure other than the obvious greediness explanation why Philippine Airlines charges this much to check bags. My other main complaint is I had also booked a one way ticket to Bangkok from Manila. As the date for that flight was getting close to arriving, my wife's mother became seriously ill and was hospitalized. This event made it impossible to make that flight to Bangkok. So I contacted Philippines Airline to request a refund since I don't know when my wife's mother will recover and we could visit Thailand as originally planned. A one way ticket from Manila was 130 dollars but Philippines Airline adds 50 dollars in fees just to book the ticket. The amount they charge for refunding the same ticket is 150 dollars. Not to mention the hoops you have to jump through with their request hub submission process and the ridiculous 25 to 30 minutes you have to spend on hold when they make you contact them by phone to explain the same exact details provided inside the written request. I'm not sure how these airlines are able to stay in business but one thing is very apparent, customer satisfaction isn't any type of priority or concern. It's a sad situation because the airlines in general and Philippines airline in particular seem to have way more interest in figuring out ways to gouge their customers every way possible than to follow practices that might make them happy.",0
Flew Orlando to Pittsburgh. I have never done a review before but thought I had to. The staff were very entertaining and polite. The gentleman over the loud speaker had a very entertaining personality while being professional. I thought they also took it an extra step further by showing everyone how to put on a life vest and how to inflate it. Not all airlines or flights that I have been on have done this. I will definitely be flying with Spirit Airlines. again!,1
I flew from the Gold Coast to Sydney yesterday my flight was meant to leave at 10.05 am. First of all it was late by half an hour after that we all boarded the aircraft that as far as it went. About half an hour later sitting on the aircraft they decided that they had some problem with the wiring we all had to go back to the terminal. At first they said it will only take 15 minutes to fix about 1400 hours we were still at the airport at 1420 hours we finally boarded the aircraft then we had to wait another 20 minutes because they realised the aircraft needed refuelling. Because of all that I missed my connecting flight to Hobart which was the only flight left of the day so no one knew if I had to stay overnight in Sydney until I arrive there so they found a flight to Hobart via Melbourne. Never again I will fly with Virgin again.,0
"Frontier Airlines flight from Las Vegas to Omaha via Denver. Flights late, which makes connecting flights hard. Did not know anything about the charge for carry on until I went online to check in. Just like some other airlines that I will not fly with again, just tell me what it is going to cost, don't bait and switch. The people at the desks were rude, but I'm sure the get the brunt of mad people. The flight crews were very good. Don't expect to get a free glass of soda or a bag of nuts, they charge for everything. There are other airlines and I will use them instead.",0
"Our first flight since the pandemic. Check in at LGW was quick and efficient. Made our way to the Emirates lounge as we had a couple of hours to spare. Service was good in the lounge and after about 15 minutes they served a hot lunch. The Goan Chicken Curry was pleasant. Flight boarded and departed on time. My wife and I had seats 14E and 14F which are ideal for a couple travelling together. At the time of travel masks were mandatory, Emirates provided spare masks and sanitizer. The food service on Emirates used to be quite drawn out but with the new system they take the meal selection from the passengers on a hand held device and it seems to be delivered in quite an efficient manner. I chose the Arabic Mezze, which was very tasty followed by the Beef Tenderloin, which was also good. Good choice of wine available. Emirates only serve one meal on the flight from Gatwick to Dubai, which we found to be sufficient. Snacks and sandwiches are available at any time, either delivered to your seat or from the bar. Overall a very good flight with Emirates.",1
"New Delhi to London via Kiev. The worst airline I have ever used for domestic or international. This was an international flight and my knees reached the next seat, I am 1,69 meters I don t know how other people managed. Flight attendant button didn t work for the whole row. Worst experience with an airline, will never use them again",0
"Flew Bangkok to Stockholm via Helsinki with Finnair. Incessant babbling over speaker system by staff in broken English and 3 other languages for every unstructured and repetitive message. Poor entertainment selection, bad food and only served once in 12 hours, only one glass of wine, extensive commercial videos forced upon you and a 3 hour delay to boot. Budget airline experience to national airline price. Never again.",0
Worst experience. No social distance. Was emailed the night before about having full flight. Was too late to change my schedule and plans. Bad bad bad. Do not care about safety,0
"Hanoi to Danang. The worst airline experience I have had in my life. Have travelled a bit, but never experienced anything like Vietjet Air. When everything goes to plan, it's an almost decent airline. As soon as anything goes wrong you're absolutely stuffed. Keep an eye on your gate and your boarding time. Everything can change in an instant and there may be no announcement.",0
"Astana to London. Air Astana provided me with great assistance at a time when I needed a relaxed easy journey. All staff I encountered were polite and helpful. There were no delays or issues at any point. Plane journey was smooth and arrived on time. Seats were comfortable and food served was delicious, not just for airline food. Entertainment on board is lacing with each seat needed a screen rather than one between rows. Easy booking process and very flexible airline with a personal touch that goes a long way. Will fly Air Astana again.",1
3rd August Luton to Kiev return Gdansk to Luton 12th August. Excellent flights all on time no issues with our luggage read the small print and made sure we were prepared. Found FA's friendly on both legs on flight to Kiev watched as FA's skilfully placed family together once airborne. As previously mentioned we did not have the interruptions that are experienced on Ryanair. Will be flying with them again. Luton airport is pleasant but the boarding areas are something else be prepared take water something to fan yourself and lots of patience Wizz Air staff in the boarding areas were fine.,1
Recently travelled from Manchester to Vancouver and return. We were concerned after reading some reviews. However all our worries were groundless flights were on time staff courteous and efficient service and food excellent. Not having individual TV screens was mildly inconvenient but we knew that was the case when we booked. We would not hesitate to travel with Air Transat again and shall recommend.,1
"Atlanta to Las Vegas. Never been on a plane before at all. The flight was ok for being inexpensive but the reason I will never fly with Frontier again is that after I paid for a checked bag I went to the airport and the lady behind the counter said that my bag was free because it was a personal item that I didn't have to pay. She gave me a slip of paper to call for a refund which was great. So when I called they told me they couldn't give me a refund because the lady didn't leave any comments saying that. Now think about it, my first time ever flying I have no idea what I was doing, not a clue. Frontier's customer service is awful. No wonder it's so cheap. Flew Delta on my return flight and it was night and day! Well worth the money!",0
"On November 13, 2017 I should fly from London to Paris. But Vueling denied my trip, no communication, very poor service. I bought a new ticket from Royal Air Morocco and requested Vueling to refund my ticket but Vueling refused to refund me. I realized that Vueling is  very poor customer service, very irresponsible. Vueling office is in Barcelona and deceive the customers. Please be extra careful when you buy your ticket.",0
The flight was 3 hours late due to snow in Chicago. I can live with that. What I won't accept is that once we landed we sat waiting for a gate for over an 1.5 hours. Then after a number of excuses the stewardess tells us that we better put our seat belts on or it will be our fault we don't get to the gate first. The 100 bucks I saved flying Spirit wasn't worth the time I lost. I could have almost driven back from Denver to Chicago in the time I spent waiting for the plane waiting for a gate and than waiting for my luggage with Spirit. When we finally got to where the gates were we saw plenty of them open. Could it be that Spirit only has 1 or 2 gates at O'Hare? The stewardess kept telling us all the airlines were waiting. I don't care about the other airlines I just cared about the one I was on.,0
"First of all the front desk ladies were very sweet and helpful, I can not complain about them. Now lets start, the staff on board were rude and did not seem bothered with the clients at all. After the safety instructions were done, they simply went and buckled themselves in, not one of them came by and checked to see if any of the passengers were buckled in. When we arrived my sons car seat was booked in as special baggage, well thank you for breaking the chair into two pieces. The car seat was thrown on the floor in the middle of the conveyors where you collect your bags. We asked the people at the kiosk where we should collect the special baggage, they simply pointed to stuff thrown on the floor and there was where my sons car seat was thrown. When we flew with Mango on the 4th they brought my sons car seat to us to the kiosk on a trolley as it should be but to throw someone's baggage like it garbage is disgusting. Staff have no personality, no drive and no respect for your clients goods. When we flew with Mango again on the 4th of Feb the pilots were excellent, they kept telling us and informing us where we were, but the pilots of flysafair did none of that. I regret not flying with Mango again and regret that I used your services. I will never be you client again and I advise anyone not to make use of your services!",0
"Johannesburg to George. 2 hour delay, old planes would not recommend. Poor communication from the airline. Will not use them again. Cheap in this case means cheap planes.",0
"Rio de Janeiro to Lisbon. I booked a flight at the end of January. As my plans changed I cancelled the flight on December 10th. This should be no problem as I booked a fully refundable flight. As I paid with credit card, the time for processing the refund was stated as 7 weekdays. I've been waiting more than double the time now and still not seeing any refund! So if you're a spontaneous person changing plans from time to time don't book with TAP Portugal!",0
EK 027 DXB to GLA on 23rd Mar. Aircrew were outstanding and very professional. Meals were tasty and enjoyable. Aircraft was new with excellent ICE range of all the latest movies. Aircrew were very friendly and worked well serving refreshments during the whole flight with a good caring smiling attitude and did a fantastic job.,1
Melbourne to Perth. Staff were amazing! A big thank you to the cabin manager of this service who allowed me to upgrade to business class for free and gave me the opportunity to speak to a first officer of the airline! I would recommend Virgin Australia any day for amazing service.,1
"Ahmedabad to Hyderabad via New Delhi. This is my 4th consecutive flight with SpiceJet that has got delayed. It's a hassle to rearrange my entire travel plan or wait extra hours in the airport. SpiceJet is unapologetic about it. For me, this is the last time I'll be flying SpiceJet.",0
Bengaluru to Delhi. Worst experience. Travelled several times Indigo but never faced issue. Spicejet is not at all customer friendly. Rude tone of staff. Not managed properly. Seriously in my life no one I know will book Spicejet again.,0
6 months waiting for vouchers. Rang them multiple times but they keep telling me it's not their department.  They won't put me through to the correct dept. or give me contact details for them. Just keep putting me off.,0
"London to Manila. We booked flights for Thursday 7th June. 3 weeks before our flight date we have been told that the flight is cancelled and we either have to fly a day later and miss the wedding or a day earlier and have to take unpaid leave and deal with work complications because of it. If we had known before we would have chosen a different airline, however 3 weeks before the flight date flights have sky rocketed in price and suitable flights not available so is not an option. What's more the flights we now were cheaper at the time of booking so we have now also overpaid for a flight we did not want. No compensation or apology from Philippines Airlines so far. Very poor service and terrible reliability.",0
WX 300 Cardiff to Edinburgh. 18th May. Return 19th May WX 310. Travelled from Cardrff to Edinburgh and was hugely impressed by the service. The attendants were very helpful and happy and the complimentary drinks and snacks came in handy. Shame they're leaving Cardiff airport.,1
Flair Air is by far the worst airline I have ever dealt with. Absolutely unacceptable customer service. Inconsistent answers to my queries. Extremely long wait times at the call center. A broken online system for changing flights. Unorganized and unprofessional at the ticket counter. Weather delays and unserviceable aircraft are forgivable but the dealings I've had with Flair are not. Pay a little more money and fly with the competitors and save yourself a lot of grief.,0
My review is pretty mixed as I had a terrible impression on the way out but a much better one coming home. Plane was brand new so lovely. We had the screens drop down to show us how far we had to fly where we were temperature etc. Cabin crew on the other hand were awful. Never met such a miserable bunch of people who clearly hate their jobs! Everything was too much trouble! Service was appalling. No smiles nothing! Flight was on time. I couldn't wait to get off the plane once we landed in Lanzarote! No hello no goodbye just grunts and huffs. Food was disgusting and dried up but coffee was nice. Coming home plane was a bit of an old banger our seats were ripped arm rests were falling apart and the drop down trays were too big so didn't come down properly if you were over a size 12. The crew however were lovely. All smiles hellos goodbyes and enjoying the banter we had with them. Food was still gross from what we could see from other passengers but coffee was still nice and the service was excellent. Food and drink is very over priced for what it is.,0
"Berlin to Madrid. This company used to be very good, I always preferred to travel with them than with Ryanair, but this it's no longer like that. Yesterday, one person of the company don't let me go into the plane because I was 1 minute late. The plane was there with the stairs, but she didn't let me in. 15 minutes later the plane take off without me. I was 1 minute late but she has no humanity at all. Next time I will choose a company without robots.",0
"Riyadh to Manila Premium Economy, Seat 24D. Flight was smooth, with some turbulence. Ipads were on loan to the passengers for free. Food was excellent, and cabin temperature was cold but manageable. if only the Premium Economy lavatory is exclusive to Premium Economy passengers, thus the long queue of even the economy passengers on the next section. Otherwise it could have been perfect or better yet, add another lavatory in this section.",1
"Flew American Airlines from Belize to Manchester via Los Angeles. Flight late, so missed connecting flight. Lost my luggage, unbelievably rude Baggage Claim. I had to locate bag 4 days later, no contact. No food on 5 hour US flight, awful meal on transatlantic flight. Charge for checked in luggage. Grudging rude staff. Full on prices, pared down service and facilities. Very expensive low budget standard airline. No entertainment on 5 hour flight unless have own device on which app may or may not load. In any event has to be done before you fly. Avoid.",0
"Terrible service, rude arrogant staff. Stay away from this airline. They will do everything to annoy you. An airline that shows no interest at you apart from trying to make you purchase another ticket.",0
"Departed Toronto to London on December 12, 2019 morning flight and returned London to Toronto on January 1, 2020 AC 857. I have to say check in, boarding process, in flight on all flights were well organized and quick, all staff were attentive when needed but left you when needed. All staff were great and very pleasant. We fly Air Canada regularly and sometimes things go wrong these are usually out of control of the staff and our experience is they are always professional and friendly. Air Canada you know your business keep doing what you do as you are good at it!",1
April 2nd return on April 17th. Outgoing flight MU552 plus MU2504 MU2342 MU5183 and return flight MU551. We have just returned from a 3 week trip to China. I had read all the negative reviews about China Eastern and approached the flights with great trepidation. We did long haul to Shanghai then several internal flights then one flight back to UK from Beijing via Shanghai. Apart from one very inedible breakfast I was completely satisfied with my flights. The staff were attentive pleasant and polite and the food good. My only criticism is that they don't really serve alcoholic beverages and my husband was only allowed 1 beer on the way home. For a budget airline the service was good and all flights took off and landed on time. Well done China Eastern airlines.,1
"Kuala Lumpur to Milan via Jeddah. Great airline, such amazing food and really nice staff.  Like the food is amazing. Comfortable seats, good entertainment.",1
"Chicago to Los Angeles. This is the worst airline I have ever used. Delayed us for ""weather"" which I know to be rubbish since we drove from the city the plane came from. Then when our plane arrived they gave it to another flight that they moved to our gate and delayed us another 3 hours! Unfortunately I am still here but I will never use or recommend Sprit Airlines.",0
"Due to fly from Orlando to Los Angeles with Jetblue Airways. Been sitting here for an hour and a half waiting to for maintenance to check the plane. Barely gave us water and cookies while we wait. We're all just waiting to see what happens. Can't get off the plane. We're all stuck. On top of that, my TV doesn't work. They keep saying they'll reset the TV's but they haven't yet. This truly is the worst flight I've been on. I'll let you know when we leave.",0
Travelled EY38 on 24 Dec 2013. Service was horrible. Stewardess did not smile. My sister and I asked for pasta upon hearing that the stewardess replied rudely that she needed to check and she cannot guaranteed that both of us would get our choice of meals. We told her politely that we could not take the other meal choice due to the meat. She replied coldly we should have asked for special meal. We understand that we cannot guarantee to have our choice of meals given a full flight. However the stewardess could told us politely. This is certainly not the service that I expected. This is the first and last time I will travel with Etihad.,0
I've flown Spirit 5 times in the last three months. Every single flight has been significantly late. My flight tonight was scheduled to depart at 9pm now saying delayed until 10.30. It's not weather I checked. And all the other flights are running on time. Delay delay delay. The equipment is fine and the staff are friendly so as long as you don't actually need to get to your destination its not bad.,0
"Miami to Thessaloniki via Istanbul with Turkish Airlines. The aircraft was excellent and almost new, the seats lack space but the inflight cabin service was great as was the inflight entertainment. Food was plenty but not that tasty. The crew was very polite, some lacks foreign languages.",1
Mumbai to Jaipur. It was a great experience for me to fly with Jet airways. The journey was very comfortable though flight was delayed ofr 45mins but i guess it was ok because I understand it was not the airlines fault. And also the cabin crew were very courteous and a staff helped me to put my bag as there was no space to keep my bag with me below my seat. Overall it was a nice experience.,1
"Frankfurt to Dublin. Dealing with this company has by far been one of the worst experiences I have had when working with an airline. I had a change of flight and had purchased the travel insurance to make sure I was covered. When making the initial purchase, the travel insurance was offered to me after I put in all the information stating I was an American and not an EU resident. When submitting a claim to get some money back, they explicitly denied my claim because of not having an EU residence. Working with their customer service to work on the claim, they have not provided any of the information that I have asked for in order to look through the ""insurance"" that was provided. Absolutely a terrible company and I will never fly with them again and recommend to everyone to avoid this company.",0
Washington to Delhi via Abu Dhabi. I will never suggest any Handicapped or the person needing assistance to travel with Etihad or its partner Airline . Etihad treat their passengers who are handicapped with no respect and the service is degraded. I have been the loyal customer for Etihad for past 4 years and flown only their business class multiple times a year. This time I had the health issues and noticed the service they provided was really bad. Asked for the wheel chair and the reply was they they don't have one and I have to walk. This time I requested the wheelchair and the service I got was very poor.,0
The staff constantly see the need to come behind the curtain exposing two bright lights to passengers who pay the privilege of sitting in row 1A in executive class. These insensitive staff feel the need to conduct a loud and animated conversation within the executive cabin throughout the night. We pay for lie flat beds and are constantly subjected to being woken up at constant period throughout the night and not from fellow passengers. The food is poor and who cares for duty free so why do they need to charge down the aisle every 15 minutes. My rubbish was never collected.,0
"Horrible. I was traveling to Germany to see my two sons and in Amsterdam watched as I was moved over two days to one cancelled flight to another. The flight in was horrible, worst staff and food I ever experienced. In Chicago they made us stay on our plane 5 hours on the tarmac. When we got to Amsterdam the crew vanished. There was no support, no help, no representatives. I had to take trains and finally pay a driver to take me into Dusseldorf to ensure I made my visit with my children. Sure enough even the flights the following two days were cancelled. The worst was they never provided any food or lodging.",0
My husband for the first time booked three flights with Southwest. We flew from Orlando to New Orleans from New Orleans to Dallas then from Dallas back to Orlando. We were very pleased with the service and we agreed that every seat on a Southwest flight IS compatible to flying first class with any other carrier. They all should take note IJS. You must remember to print your boarding pass 24 hours prior to your flight departure this will determine your boarding zone. The check in was so smooth! No need to fly with any other carrier.,1
I will never fly American Airlines again. Every time I book with them my flight is cancelled. Tonight my flight was cancelled and their solution is to book me for a flight on Monday. That's 2 days after I am scheduled to arrive at my destination. I waited in line 2 hours for this solution and their solution is a cot in the airport.,0
I was very disappointed with the flight and staff who overcharged me for luggage. I paid for extra luggage through the app but I was told the 40 kg that I paid extra for was free and included within my ticket price and my son had no allowance dispite paying full adult rates. In had the police called on me at the airport when I tried to stand my ground but fortunately the policeman was very good and took my side. The staff wasted over 2 and a half hour of our time and the only way we could get on the plane was to pay extra. After writing to Pegasus they now say they have investigated but have all the facts wrong and have refused to refund the extra charges. They have unfortunately ruined our holiday at the last and left us so disheartened that we will definitely not be travelling with them again.,0
Horrible. Always late and you pay extra for everything. The cheaper price is a scam. 65 dollars for carry on both ways. No free water or snacks of any kind. Uncomfortable seats.,0
"A very pleasant surprise for my first time on Nouvelair flying from Monastir to Paris CDG. Very friendly staff and excellent service on the ground and in the air. Reasonably priced food and drink on board. Flight was generally on time. Great and easy experience flying out of Monastir airport. Overall, so much better than the national Tunisian carrier.",1
"Auckland to New Delhi via Beijing. Worst experience of my life. Flight took off from Auckland, flew for a few hours, then the pilots realise that there is an engine problem and lands back at Auckland. Then they kept misleading the passengers to wait for an hour, to get the problems solved, but kept delaying more. Eventually we are told to return the next day for the next flight. No compensation provided. No hotel rooms provided. Passengers were stranded from different locations without even knowing if the airline will book further connecting flights or not. No courtesy towards passengers. Rampant language problem. The flight hostess didn't even understand English. We were stranded in Auckland for a day, sleeping in the airport. After returning to check in counter the next day, they didn't take our issue or priority and we were the third last people to get our boarding passes, that too through a different route. But the next flight got delayed as well by over 8 hours. Now we are stranded here, and going to miss our connecting flights again. The airline staff are very rude and not being helpful in our matter.",0
I travelled from Sydney via Abu Dhabi to Manchester my biggest problem the first leg to Abu Dhabi was with Virgin Australia I cannot understand why they will not issue a boarding pass for the two legs of the flight. The having to queue in Abu Dhabi for the boarding pass to Manchester was disgusting at a time when you would like to be relaxing after a 14 hour flight and looking around the airport instead you have to queue for a minimum of between 1 and 2 hours to get a boarding pass. The same on the way home had to do it all over again. The flights were very good cant complain about them but this can really turn you off flying with them again. I know they are two different airlines but flying together in unison surely this problem could be sorted out to the passengers convenience.,1
Business class. Scheduled to fly from Rome to Gatwick on 7 May on BA2543. The day that the fire broke out at Rome airport. We had a 12.45pm flight. I received a text from BA at 6.30am advising of flight cancelled due to the fire and to contact BA. I called them and they rebooked us on flight BA555 at 8.15pm but direct to Heathrow. We accepted the flight change considering and lounged around Rome for the morning. Than when about to get the train to Rome airport received a text from BA advise that flight had been changed to Naples and if we wanted that flight to make our way to Naples. So we high tailed it onto a train and in 2 hours we were in Naples. The flight did not leave till 9.30pm as they were waiting on others who had made the trip to Naples and out of 152 seats on the plane about 130 people made the trip to Naples. I think the communication and the effect that BA did to get us out of Rome under the circumstances was excellent. A friend was flying to Paris from Rome on another airline and he was delayed till midnight and his luggage was not to accompany them and was delivered 2 days later to him. Once on board in Euro Business class it was all pamper. The meal was excellent of rockmelon with truffle infused coleslaw and BBQ style prawns. Finished with a rhubarb and custard desert and washed down with a lovely Spanish white. Once landed bags were quick out on the belt and away we went. So well down BA for what I know for others turned out to be a nightmare.,1
"Mumbai to Dallas Ft Worth via Doha with Qatar Airways in business class. This must be one of the top airlines in the world. Food and drinks are at restaurant standard. Inflight service was impeccable and crew. AVOD had a good selection. Cabin was very clean and toilets maintained the whole time going to Dallas. Wines were great, especially the rose.",1
Stansted to Naples. They made me purchase Priority 2 cabin bags for the way back without telling me it was already sold out for the way out. This cannot even be refunded!  I won't be flying with Ryanair anymore. Customer service charged me 13p a minute and they did not pick up for 15 minutes. Chat do not get answered before an hour.,0
"Absolutely will never fly this airline again. I got here 3 hours early for a flight from New York JFK to Boston and am writing this from the TSA line. My flight leaves in 25 minutes and one of their belts on the security line broke and all the TSA people are just standing around discussing what to do. Not to mention, couldn't check in early, and had to wait for 45 minutes to drop my bag. For the amount I'm paying for my ticket, they should have more employees here. Would rather fly spirit than fly this terrible airline again",0
On May 4th 2015 flight 145 out from Santo Domingo Dominican Republic was delayed for 4 hours. My connection to Orlando was delayed for 2 hours. The airplane came in we boarded and 30 minutes later we had to get out of the plane because maintenance problems. So we had to take an other airplane that it scheduled to depart at 12.15am. Horrible service! I won't use it again!,0
"Sydney to Melbourne. The second time I took Jetstar for interstate travel. Never taking their service again. Terrible behaviour by staff, rude and arrogant. I was asked to keep my phone away and after the first request, I was told that my phone will be confiscated. Never faced such troubles in any airline across the entire world.",0
"I paid for a Spirit Airlines ticket but my flight was cancelled the day of. The excuse given was bad weather for the incoming plane. Ironically we checked other airlines none of the others had cancelled incoming flights. Furthermore my flight had few seats sold which I thought was very interesting and concerning. The flight was cancelled and the very few customers who had bought tickets were delayed from the morning to the afternoon. The problem is for people with connecting flights. This airline should not be called a ""no frills"" airline but a ""non caring"" airline. When a consumer buys a ticket there's a trust that the flight will be honored. People who were stranded weren't put up in a hotel. The resounding feeling from those on the flight was that they won't fly Spirit again. Once again there are critical time sensitive reasons for travel. Once an airline breaks the customers' trust it is hard to regain.",0
Ottawa to Toronto with Air Canada. Given a free upgrade since I volunteered to be bumped off the last flight. Surprised they used such large equipment on this flight but I assume it was to continue on to an international flight. On this 40 minute flight there wasn't exactly a lot of time to experience Air Canada's international business class but the FAs came by with drinks and a cheese platter. Plane looked pretty dated and shook a lot during take off but the flight was pretty smooth. Ground staff at Toronto were pretty helpful at directing me to my connecting flight to JFK. Pretty satisfied with my short time on AC.,1
"Terrible Boarding representatives, very high baggage price, The manager in lynx Toronto threatened to make me lose my flight and call the police on me. Last time am flying Lynx Air. The Reps are Rude and lack customer service skills.",0
"Hong Kong To Shanghai in  business class. The flight crew provide friendly and excellent services, and make me feel comfortable on this 2.5 hour flight. I will take China Eastern Airlines for my future business trip.",1
"I traveled this flight on 2 November from Dubai to Ahmedabad. however, they forgot all bags in Dubai during transit. unfortunately, I declare about by 3 bag missing but till 2 days no reply even I call often his office number. Even I come from west Africa to celebrate Diwali I don't have any personal belong clothes or things which I bought from there. I don't know how they manage flight schedule and language management because it's worse.",0
"Warsaw to Almaty via Riga. I was cheated by the airline. Because of the coronavirus, all flights got canceled as borders remain closed and yet, the airline refused to give me a refund even if I asked them a few times to do so. Never again!",0
"Dubai to Delhi. I loved going on Emirates with my family. The food was good, and so were the kid's meals. The kids got toys. The entertainment was great. The only thing was that I couldn't sleep and I wasn't very comfortable.",1
Flew on GA854 back to Singapore. It was a morning flight and was quite empty. I flew on their newest B738 and the seat was comfortable. The crews were friendly serving all passengers and the breakfast was tasty as well.,1
I didn't expect that I would get a meal for 2 hours of flight going to Kuala Lumpur from BKK but they served meals free of charge. I took Malaysia Airline to Incheon from Kuala Lumpur and the best part of the 6 hours of journey was that the crew were providing with soft drinks and the food served was so great. They had a Korean stewardess working in the plane so it was easier and comfortable to communicate with her whenever i needed a help or anything. Thank you for your best service.,1
My wife had a one hour flight from Ft. Lauderdale to Tampa at 9.45pm. It was then delayed until midnight. There was no problem with the plane they just didn't have anyone to fly it! About a half hour before they were supposed to board the flight gets delayed again! This time they will not be leaving until 1am. This airline should be ashamed of itself. No compensation was offered just a half hearted apology. We will never fly Spirit again. I will pay extra to stay away.,0
"Qatar Airways is the best in the world and I received the best quality service from them. The cabin crew is the number one. If you want to be treated like a friend and cared like a friend, choose Qatar airways.",1
"Dubai to Baku. Very disappointed by customer service and crew. Price was not bad but they have some really stupid rules which they follow by the book, and that's how they make money. This trip cost me far more than what I originally planned for, because this airline is not trying to help, very unhelpful and rude. They are Not flexible at all and even call centre was very rude and not caring at all, Airplane was fine but no food, drink, headphones not even blanket for children.",0
San Jose to San Salvador and to Belize City. We were greeted with friendly smiles and offered sparkling wine or orange juice or water. The staff was impeccable and service first class. Avianca use porcelain dinner wear glass and linen etc. Just try getting sparkling wine on any US Flight.,1
Flew to Taiwan during Sept 2014 this is absolutely the best flight I have been on. The staff were extremely polite and looked after you. The large 180 degree chair is really easy to sleep on and the inflight entertainment although I didn't really use it much had quite a lot of features.,1
"Boston to Venice via Montreal. Our flight was delayed out of Boston and we ended up missing our connection. After a complete lack of information in Montreal we waited in line for an hour for what we though was rebooking our flights but turned out was just to issue us vouchers for a hotel and informed we had to call to change our flights. Missing our connection meant we lost a hotel in Venice and our train tickets the next day to Rome. There was a flight directly to Rome for less money that AC refused to put us on because we didn't book that flight. The Boston terminal is small, and has poor air conditioning.",0
Absolute worst service. Flight canceled three times. Missed a family reunion. Spent over 3 hours on hold trying to get a refund. Airport hot and filthy. Not that cheap when you add baggage costs. They've canceled my flight before just as I arrived at the gate and I swore then if never use them again. I took a chance and got screwed.,0
London City to Zurich. The flight was operated by Helvetica and Swiss puts the hell in Helvetica! They downgraded my flight from business to economy and no equivalent compensation. Upon boarding being a high tier point customer they didn't even bother giving me a seat via to my online preferences! Let alone an emergency exit! Being close to 2m on height the flight was a hell of an experience!,0
Tokyo Narita to Adelaide via Melbourne. We arrived at the airport late due to issues with the train breaking down. They refused to board us. They then refused to assist us in any way just providing a phone contact number for Japan. The phone number did not work at all. They then told us to call the international number. Tried using the pay phone but all my coins were exhausted after over a 20 min wait. Eventually got skype working on the wifi and was told I would need to pay over twice the price I paid to fly. Ended up just purchasing tickets with jetstar. At least you know what you are paying for there. For a full service airline to offer no assistance at all with anything you might as well just fly the budget option.,0
"Los Angeles to Portland. If I could give a negative review I would. Flight cancelled, claim we can't go from to Portland til two days from now, can't put us on another airline, reading from script. Horrible, inhuman service. Do not ever use them.  Cut me off, refused to take a callback number.",0
"Ibiza to Barcelona with Ryanair. Really bad experience, really poor customer service! Flight is cheap but there are waiting around the corner with a 56 euros fee when checking in. Be aware and go check out the website or even better, use Vueling Airlines!",0
"Jeddah to Amman. Flight time got delayed for one hour without prior notice. Aircraft cleanliness and was disgusting, seat size was too small and aircraft was very old.",0
"Bangkok to Koh Samui. They call themselves a Boutique Airline and they certainly are. Staff very attentive, flight was on time. On a 50 mins flight they managed to serve a delicious Phad Tai followed by Coffee. Like the good old days, Bangkok Air treated us like appreciated customers.",1
Santiago to Sydney. Horrible airline. Flight got cancelled. No explanation given. Hardly any communication from the airline. It took the 6 hours of hell to get to a hotel. A complete debacle. 14 hours later we finally got on a flight. Every step in the process was absolute chaos. These guys are a complete joke and have no idea how to run an airline. Food on the plane is Rick bottom and portions are tiny.,0
By far the most uncomfortable flight I've experienced! Flew to Phoenix and back on same plane last week. Not much leg room. Tough to get out. Didn't recline seat because it will give rear passenger even less space. Felt bad for people above 5' and people with disabilities. Entertainment not worth it. Movies were outdated. Won't fly Air Canada if this is their new way of flying. Will go for West Jet!,0
"This is the worst airline I've ever flown on. Ground staff at JFK has attitude issue. Not helpful at all. ""Computer says No"" is probably their company motto. I'm a OneWorld emerald member, I wasn't offered the lounge access, instead of giving us the help that we supposed to have, computer says no there is nothing we can do. You are welcome to purchase the pass if you want So I called Cathay Pacific in Hong Kong, they said we are surely entitled to the lounge access. On flight service is as appalling. I'm not going to spend my energy to drill down the details. This is the first time and also the last time I will travel on American Airlines. No more.",0
"Zurich to Venice. We missed our flight and the man working at the gate proceeded to lecture us about being late and how it was our fault, etc. He told us to go to the transfer desk where we waited for over an hour only to be told there was nothing they could do to help us except we buy a new ticket for twice the price! This was our first time missing a flight with Swiss and we had no idea we would lose every dime we paid for a round trip ticket. Overall, I would not recommend as the policies are strict even with trip insurance.",0
"Toronto to Rome via Istanbul. I have flown many other airlines Business Class previously, and never have I received the great service as on Turkish Airlines. Staff were courteous and efficient, and they went out of their way to speak English to us. As mentioned earlier the food was delicious, served with attention to taste, and appearance. Since I was travelling with my husband I was delighted to be able to sit beside him rather than separated or angled away from him. My flight from Toronto to Istanbul was wonderful as was my flight the next day from Istanbul to Rome. I will fly Turkish Airlines again.",1
"Plane was over an hour late leaving, no problem that can happen. But on arrival at Heathrow, the plane sits on the runway for 45 minutes as there was no free stand to go to. Then once at the stand we waited another 45 minutes as there was no bridge available to enable us to get off the plane. Just pathetically inefficient.",0
"Horrible! After 12 hour delay in getting to our final destination due to needing to refuel the plane and therefore missing our connection, they refused to reimburse us or even give food vouchers for while we were stuck in the airport waiting for the next available flight. On the return trip home they broke one of our checked cars eats and refused to reimburse for a new car seat.",0
"My family and I booked a trip to visit my grandma. On the way home I had the worst flight experience I'd ever had. We had just landed in Salt Lake and our plane to Minneapolis was already boarding. I was 7 and a half months pregnant running to the gate. I had to use the restroom so bad and I was having horrible pain. When we were almost to the gate we realized that for some reason I had been placed on a separate flight from the rest of my family. So that I did not have to be alone while this far along and in pain my dad, in front of the two gate employees gave me his boarding pass. This caused a lot of problems and delayed the flight. Everyone was talking about me and I was having a panic attack. The captain tried to convince me to get off the plane and made me feel bad for having him rewrite my ticket. The plane ride was bumpy, I was in pain and I was having a horrible panic attack. After being in the air for awhile I calmed down and was able to relax. To top it off as I was leaving the flight, the flight attendants rudely mentioned, as they were right next to me that someone who was not supposed to be there delayed the flight. Even though I was originally on a different flight, Delta never apologized for isolating a 7 and a half month pregnant woman from her babies father and the rest of her family for no reason. Did nothing to make me feel better. And everyone was extremely rude. I don't understand this and I will not be flying with Delta again. The worst flying experience I have ever.",0
Kuwait to Mumbai on 28 September 2014. Only 2 toilets available for all economy passengers toilets soon dirty not cleaned. Uncomfortable seats. As soon as plane landed in Mumbai and still moving fast seat belts were opened and passengers started pulling bags out of the overhead lockers. Staff's reaction was late and not effective. Then pulling shoving and pushing to get out of airplane first window seat passengers elbowing their way past aisle seat passengers chaos reigned. Never again Jet Airways!,0
"Flew United Airlines Denver to Los Angeles. Very friendly, courteous, welcoming and professional flight crew. Enjoyable flight through and through. No scales pitch for a credit cards. Comfortable seating. The flight attendants were accommodating for my request to fill my tea thermos as well.",1
"I flew from Kansas City MCI airport to Las Vegas with my roommate. On the way back we had a stop in Detroit. Our plane was delayed 20 minutes in that airport. The flight to Kansas City was a bit rough. When we landed and proceeded to get our luggage it was not there. The lady in Las Vegas had short checked our bags to Detroit. We filed a claim and it stated we would be receiving a call the next morning. Long story short, they have terrible hours and my roommate received his luggage and I did not. The staff are not very helpful and kept telling me all I can do is wait. It is like they are basically saying ""oh well"". The Detroit baggage staff are no help at all and rush you off the phone. I paid 31 dollars for my bag to be on that plane and I have things that I need. I will continue to file a claim to be reimbursed. The baggage man says Spirit is known for losing luggage. I will never take Spirit airlines again, it's not worth it after all the fees anyway.",0
"My last experience with Air France was very good. Had a very long flight from Papeete to Paris via Lax for transfer. The cabin crew were very caring and even funny! The inflight entertainment offered a wide choice of movies and music, with some recent releases. The food quality was exquisite, two times services from PPT to LAX and again from LAX to CDG. The seat was very comfortable and I slept like a baby! I would book for sure again Business Class on that route, if only prices wouldn't be that high for this way! It was worth it!",1
"My wife and I always travel business class on international flights and thought this was what we were purchasing when we bought ""Comfort Class"" tickets however the only relationship their ""Comfort Class"" has to business class is that you are able to use the business class lounges. Our check in was off in the corner of the airport no priority check in for ""Comfort Class"" and the line was almost an hour long. In the boarding area we were paged by name and the agent took our four tickets ripped them up then reissued three tickets. I returned to the desk and asked for the missing ticket and the agent tore up the three tickets and reissued four tickets. When I returned to my wife she reviewed them and noted we now had three tickets and a duplicate. I returned to the desk and again the agent tore up the four tickets and issued four appropriate ones. The boarding time came and went and we all continued to stand around. Eventually we boarded then sat for an hour at the gate. The flight subsequently made up almost all of the time. The plane didn't appear clean. Upon boarding we realized our seats were very uncomfortable and clearly weren't comparable to business class seats with other airlines. The seats are hard and have no lumbar support. There is perhaps an extra inch or an inch and a half more width than coach class. These seats don't lie flat or come close to it. The only entertainment was from small screens on the forward bulkheads. The cabin attendants were very pleasant and the food was well prepared. The organization of the return flight was just as big a mess as the initial flight. The gates were way off on their own and although coming from a connecting flight we had to again pass security. Condor agents finally showed up. There were no announcements but they manned 3 desk positions the boarding position and also had a woman who wandered back and forth behind the desk becoming involved in some passenger details. We were in a long line to board but when it was our turn we were directed back to one of the desk positions to show our passports again. We waited in the long line to show our passports and then the agent directed us back to the long line waiting to board. Finally we boarded this time the plane was clean but the seats were just as uncomfortable as on our initial flight. Once again the cabin attendants were quite pleasant. They gave us food frequently and it was always good. We will never use this airline again.",0
We were on the fourth flight scheduled from San Juan to Tortola BVI. The first three were cancelled due to mechanical problems with the plane. The fourth flight finally left 2 hours late. American Eagle does not have enough mechanics or spare parts to keep their planes in the air in a reliable way. In the future I will fly to St. Thomas and take the ferry to Tortola to avoid American Eagle.,0
EK751 Dubai to Casablanca on May 8th 2014. Using miles to upgrade from business to first class on a recent Dubai to Casablanca flight I was beyond disappointed in the product and the experience from what I had considered a world class airline eager to stand out amongst its strong rivals like Etihad or Qatar Airways. Not only was the cabin crew service rude and sporadic the inflight entertainment system was faulty the first class catering was not offered and the headsets were defective. And when all this was reported to customer service there was a very passive response to the feedback. This airline was once a star but it is definitely falling from grace.,0
Fort Lauderdale to Montego Bay. Booking with Spirit Airline was my first and last time! I paid 580.00 for a round trip ticket and drove 8 hours to catch the cheap flight. Only to end up spending over 200.00 to check baggage. Forget snacks and drinks because it cost extra as well.,0
Ibiza to Glasgow. Disgraceful airline with employees who have 0 customer service skills. Charged 55 euros for myself and my wife because we were unable to do an online check in because the email address was wrong. To add insult they sat me and my wife at opposite ends of the plane. We were also charged 25 euros for hand luggage which ended up in the hold. I'll never use this horrible airline again.,0
"Flew Volotea from Nice to Strasbourg. Airline extremely disorganized, boarding took far longer than normal. We ordered ""plus seats"" online which promised priority boarding, seat selection, and a snack onboard, however, we did not receive any snacks and there was no priority boarding. One of the worst flights I have ever taken.",0
"Paris to Sarajevo via Belgrade on Air Serbia. Friendly and polite staff, delicious food, comfortable seats. For me Air Serbia has the best price, food and staff, and I am very satisfied.",1
"Purchased round trip tickets for 90 yr old disabled vet, 11 yr old and two adults. We departed from San Antonio to Las Vegas, our return flight was a travelers worst nightmare. Two emails were received regarding delayed departure, got to the airport and we were informed that our flight was canceled! Frontier refused to provide us with any assistance. Such as, access to a wheelchair and certainly no help getting a return flight. We were told to ""use the white courtesy phone to arrange for another flight with another airline."" Do not use Frontier. They're not there to help you, they're all about taking your money and leaving you stranded.",0
Madrid to New York in Business class. A wonderful plane and seat. The seat went flat into a bed had many functions electrically went down into any position had a massage function and a footrest. The Personal TV was great with lots of movies and TV shows. My main course was good. The business class lounge at Madrid was nice. From Venice to Madrid we were in business class and it was good with comfortable seats and good food. No TV's though and the seats weren't much different from economy but they don't sell the middle seat so you have more room. On both flights the crew were nice.,1
Amsterdam to Cape Town via Amsterdam. I would highly recommend KLM to anyone The food was amazing and the flight attendants were very friendly and helpful. Every connecting flight was on on time. Smooth takeoff and landing.,1
I flew Moscow SVO to Helsinki with Aeroflot I'm very happy with the service very helpful staff. Spacious Economy Class and a very good value for more than an hour flight. No delays on time.,1
"Gatwick to Hong Kong. Im a CX gold card and lounge access at BA given. Boarding fast, lovely welcome, seat in PE great, loads of space. Food really tasty, snacks, noodles delivered quickly. Captain informative and after slight delay, we arrived on time. Crew are good, a lot is expected of them and they deliver. Big negative is new 'print off your ticket and bag tags' procedure. Its not that clear how.",1
"Arrived 2 minutes late for check in at a regional airport and there was no staff to check us for our Qantas flight. Virgin Australia frights staff advised us to go past security and the Qantas staff are at the gate which will help you. Another 5 mins getting past security we got to the Qantas staff and viewed our plane arriving from Sydney for pick up passengers at Coffs Harbour. The staff member from Qantas said she would get her supervisor who arrived 5 min later, she advised the flight was closed and we would have to book another flight.",0
"Hamilton to Tampa. Horrible experience with Swoop. We fly at least 4 times per year and would never consider this airline for family travel ever again. They have one check in agent for 2 or 3 flights and they just delay your flight without warning indefinitely after scrambling to get you through. I would believe the online reviews of this airline. I am usually pessimistic but it is just as fast driving to your destination, with less stress. Horrible airline I hope Transportation Canada eventually shuts down.",0
"Winnipeg to Grande Prairie via Edmonton. Here I sit at Edmonton Airport. I now have 8 hours to burn since my connecting flight was cancelled. Cancelled due to mechanical issues, I totally understand and accept the delay. However, due to the first flight out of Winnipeg that departed at 5 am, I haven't slept yet and a shower would have made the delay so much more bearable. Instead, after pleading with the airline, all they could do is a 10.00 voucher for a coffee and a muffin and ""we're sorry for the inconvenience"".",0
"My wife and I were due to fly from Porto to Stansted with Ryanair. We had already flown to Porto with them and there were no problems and we arrived in plenty of time for the Flight passing through immigration and going to the gate. When we tried to board the plane the Ryanair employee said we could not fly. We asked why and she said my wife needed her boarding pass approved as she was not an EU Citizen. I tried to point out that my wife had a UK permanent residency card, but she refused to look and told us to ""stand over there or I will call the police"". As the plane was close to leaving, I approached her again and got the same threat. Finally after the plane left she and her colleague took us down a ramp opened a door and told us to go through. She slammed the door behind us and laughed as she left with her colleague. We were back in arrivals. As a result we had to stay overnight in Porto and book flights back to London City the next day, then train and bus back to Stansted. All in all an awful experience. I have complained to Ryan Air since September. First they acknowledged the claim and gave me a pass code to monitor it on their website. The latter was not recognized so I emailed them. No response for 7 months to numerous emails. I finally wrote to the MD in Ireland and received an email asking for copies of our travel documents, which I sent the same day. 7 days later I emailed again asking them to acknowledge receipt ... no answer. After another 7 days they emailed me to say I had not replied to their email. I replied and forwarded the original emails again one again asking for a reply. To date nothing. All I can say is that Ryanair should be ashamed of their employees action and their level of customer support which is 0.",0
Returned last night after a long weekend in Florence. Polite staff and great flight outward from Gatwick on time and with complimentary drinks and snacks. Great flight back from Florence bit of a delay at check in but no delays leaving. Early arrival at Gatwick meant we stacked to go in but this was not the airlines fault. Having read reviews before trip we were rather concerned that we might have a bad experience but this was not the case at all. This was a pleasant experience and we will use Meridiana again for our return to Florence in the coming months.,1
Flight KC907 March 21st and back on KC908 March 26th. I flew with my family from Almaty to Delhi and back and we were all very happy with the flights. The crew was nice and attentive departures were on time and we really enjoyed the time onboard.,1
My plane was delayed for an hour in Denver. I checked my bag before my partners. When we get to Desmoines her bag arrived and mine didn't. Come to find put they didn't put my bag on my plane when they had a while extra hour to do so. Southwest tells me I can get it on the next flight. I go to get my bag and that flight was delayed till 11pm. They tell me they will call me and I can get it in the morning. I arrive at 10am and no one available to give me my bag.,0
Flew AC Rouge to and from Curacao from Toronto May 21st and May 28th. I would like to echo everybody else's sentiments about just how small the seats are. I'm 5'2 and found it to be a very cramped space. I cannot imagine how uncomfortable it must be for a much taller person. The headrest is useless. When the seat in front of me was reclined it was approximately a foot away. On both flights I found the planes to be very clean and the cabin crew very professional making several cabin walks throughout the flight. I used my Ipad and managed to find a couple movies to watch using the app. There didn't seem to be anything current available the movies I watched were released in 2008 and 2010. The food was your typical airline food no better or worse than I've had on other airlines. The afternoon flight to Curacao left on time and arrived on time. The return flight was approximately 9 hours late departing at midnight. Trying to get some rest in these seats is an impossible feat. This is the main reason I give my overall trip satisfaction a 2 rating. Although I'm used to paying for food and alcohol on flights I was completely taken aback to be charged for a sandwich after a 9 hour delay. I guess that's AC for you. As for if I would travel AC Rouge again possibly during a daytime flight if the cost was significantly less than a regular airline. If it were a red eye I would pay to upgrade or choose another airline to fly with.,0
"After my husband I tried to sit together in ""open"" seats, the flight attendant got angry and went up front. Ten minutes later, a female with a McCarran airport sweater, said that if I wanted to stay on board that I couldn't make one peep during the flight. If I so much as made one peep the pilot would turn the plane around and I would be taken off and I would not be given a refund. Do they have the right to do that? After reading a bunch of documents at the FAA website, it seems as though they can only kick you off it they feel you are a safety risk. Then after you are rescreened by TSA and found not to be a risk you are to be rebooked on another flight or allowed to take your original flight if it has not already departed. Nowhere did it say that the airline can just throw you off and abandon you. I was not a safety or security risk and they knew it. I just wrinkled their feathers when I asked them why we couldn't change seats, and also asked for badge information. Their responses for why we couldn't change seats was laughable. Needless to say I will never fly Allegiant again. I am posting this review so that if you are considering taking this airline, you might want to reconsider.",0
"Bangkok to Cologne with Eurowings, and only find out that you won't get food until you check in for the flight. This is a 13 hour flight. At check in they tell you you can buy a meal on the flight. When you are in the flight you may be told there is no meal available. Great, no food for 13 hours. To get a blanket you have to pay 6 euros. Entertainment system is very limited. Cup of tea costs 2,50 euros. Not possible to pay in another currency. Stewards speak German but weren't friendly nor helpful. Will not use again. ",0
Guangzhou to Adelaide. This flight is the most satisfied that I took this year. The cabin crew are warm and earnest. The food on the flight is delicious. The whole trip gave me a very comfortable feeling. Thank you for the excellent service.,1
Disgusting check in process at Chicago airport. Disrespectful and rude customer service by the agent. Same for her other two colleagues who were very slow and definitely experiencing difficulties while working with computers.,0
We travelled from Vancouver B.C to Cancun May 11th 2014 there were 16 of us. Going down was great nice plane good food and great entertainment as it was a 6 hr plus flight. Coming back some of us on May 18th and some on May 25th was a terrible flight. We were crowded in like animals in a barn sat on tarmac for 45 min no air no seat room at all and I am only 5ft 1. I feel sorry for the people that were larger than me. No entertainment at all nowhere to even plug head phones in. I mean really at the price we paid I think we should of had some kind of entertainment for a 6 hr plus Flight. This is unacceptable and I will never recommend Air Transat.,0
Possibly the worst airline I have had the misfortune to use. Delayed over 12 hours on outbound journey. No ground staff to greet us and walked aimlessly around an airport asking for help. Had to take 3 flights the following day to get to our destination. Customer service is zero! Will never use this airline again.,0
"Worst customer service ever. They kept delaying the flight, and after four hours of waiting, cancelled the flight and could not offer any other flights. We were flying from Newark to Charlotte. Long lines of waiting to try to get another flight. We were treated like cattle. One recommendation was to drive to Baltimore and take a flight from there. Management was rude and ignored us. Then an hour on hold when I called to get my refund. Never again.",0
"Flew London to Bengaluru. British Airways have reached a new low. Flight boarded on time, but twenty minutes before departure the pilot announced that take off would be delayed as luggage was still to be loaded, and engineers were working to replace a pin. Two hours twenty minutes later flight was finally airborne. Cabin staff throughout the the flight were unpleasant and unhelpful. The BA premium is product nowhere near as good as other operators economy offering. The promised fine China dining experience only relates to main course. All other food and drink was served in plastic. The entire meal came on a cluttered tray, dumped on to tray tables with no finesse whatsoever. The chick pea starter was icy cold, the main course lamb over cooked, tasteless and inedible. Dessert and cheese portions were minuscule. Entertainment screen was marbled and very small. Reformatting films to fit to near postage stamp proportions made viewing impossible. Breakfast service made no pretence to premium service. Served on plastic and to be eaten with plastic cutlery. A very unpleasant experience. I have no wish to repeat, but sadly I have to return to Heathrow in the same way.",0
"London Heathrow to Venice with British Airways, I was lucky to sit in row 1 of the Club Europe cabin where you get the most legroom. Unfortunately the rest of the cabin has the same seat pitch as Euro Traveller. The seats are comfortable for a short flight and the service to around 16 passengers was good, with good quality food and drinks served.",1
"Dalaman to Bournemouth. One of the most comfortable flights in economy for a long time, the staff were courteous, they all spoke English well. The plane looked new, on time and a comfortable flight. We live in Bournemouth approx 15 mins from the airport so to find 2 one way flights home instead of the jaunt to Gatwick was great, it saved us hours. It is a pity there is not a scheduled flight from Bournemouth to Dalaman, the Thomson service is really a charter service, if you don't take their accommodation and are wanting flight only for longer than 2 weeks in duration it costs a fortune. Gatwick or Bristol is a lot cheaper, but a pain. It's a pity EasyJet or Ryanair don't fly from Bournemouth, they could charge a premium as it saves the stress and strain from going to Gatwick, Bournemouth Airport has a catchment of millions within an hours drive.",1
This airline was terrible!! Flew multiple times with them travelling through Vietnam and not one flight was on time! Except at least 2 hour delays on 40 minute domestic flights. Would not recommend if you want to get to your destination quickly and effectively. Worst airline ever.,0
"Oakland to Las Vegas.For all the horrible things I heard about Spirit my experience was fantastic. I was flying with my family, 2 adults, a 6 year old and a 16 month old. We had a really long layover from our first flight which was on a different airline so we had to get our bags and check back in to Spirit. The agents were very kind and allowed us to check our bags over 3 hours before our flight which is not their standard policy. The entire Spirit staff was friendly and went out of their way to ensure that we were okay traveling with children. Despite their charges for bags, seats etc. I would fly Spirit again.",1
San Francisco to Tokyo in economy class. This was the first time my wife and I have flown an international flight with ANA. From the moment we checked in everyone was extremely polite professional and even smiled. A smile goes a long way. The aircraft was clean and had the hard shell seats that slide forward instead of reclining. This took some getting used to but I managed since I didn't have anything under the seat in front of me. I don't think large people will like this style of seat. The benefit is not having the seat in front of you recline into your lap. The seat backs were higher and the top pf the seat did not taper to a head rest. The top of the seat back was the same width as the rest of the seat back. This allowed for a much larger video screen. I usually need to wear my reading glasses to watch movies but not this time! They also had room to put the remote next to the screen. Nobody hitting the seat back behind me like those touch screens and no remote in the arm rest taking up space. I also liked the foot rest. It gave me another option when adjusting to get comfortable. The differences with this aircraft did not stop there. The lavatory had automatic faucets. No need to push down and hope the water would last long enough to wash your hands. There was a beverage holder on the back of the tray table so you didn't need to pull down the tray table for only a drink. Then when you did pull down the tray table for your food there was another beverage holder in the seat back so you had more room on your tray. The main dinner course was excellent. By far the best airline food my wife and I have had in economy. Then another cart came by with miso soup. As if that wasn't enough an FA came by with Haggendaz ice cream for dessert. Throughout the flight beverage carts were making their rounds offering the soft drinks juices wine and beer. FAs walking around offering three different types of hot tea and another one offering coffee. We were rarely interrupted with those annoying long announcements in English and Japanese throughout the flight. When the seatbelt light came on no announcement. Instead FAs walked the aisles to ensure everyone was wearing their seatbelt. When dinner was served FAs carried a menu to show you what was being offered. All of the small details made a huge difference from our experiences with United and Delta. This flight was part of a trip which included flights with United. Too bad ANA cannot offer US domestic flights. United could learn a lot from ANA.,1
Istanbul to Bucharest with Tarom and the crew was friendly. The meal onboard was just fine. Prices are mostly reasonable and their planes seem to be well maintained and clean. Onboard they offer enough legroom and the seats are really comfortable. ,1
"Flying Citilink from Surabaya to Bandung, I didn't expect much with this. The seat is very comfortable. The legroom is large enough for my legs. I could sit comfortably without adjusting my leg position. The cabin is totally clean and looked very neat. One more important thing is that the flight was on time.",1
"When I heard about Vietnam Airlines' new business class I wanted to try it out. After booking my flight from Ho Chi Minh to Hanoi aboard an A350, Vietnam Airlines tells me that my flight has been cancelled and changed to a different aircraft. So, I changed my flight to a different one with an A350. But each time VNA kept on changing my flight. The day before my flight they once again changed my plane to an A330. On board the plane, the business class product was outdated and was simply a seat that could recline more than economy. The seat was not comfortable and service was average. The food was typical plane food and was not outstanding. If you are looking to fly business with VNA avoid their old planes and try to fly the 787 or 350 as the other planes are not worth the extra cash. The lounge in HCM was newly renovated and had good drink variety but a lack of food choices.",0
"The American Airlines service was ridiculous, not only were the flight attendants rude, but then the airline loses my bag that they made me check at the gate. When I landed and told them about my bag they said it would take a total of one to five days to get it back. It has now been five days, and they haven't even come close to finding my bag. It literally had my name on every side of it, and my name and address on 2 tags. They forced me to check this bag. Don't even try calling their customer service, the people are rude and extremely unhelpful. Each of them told me different things and none of them lined up with what the other people said. American Airlines must hate their customers.",0
Flew back from Toronto to Canada. After a pleasant flight out found the flight back just as good. Staff friendly even taking time to speak to my teenage daughter who was a nervous flyer. Food good. Seats aren't the roomiest but nevertheless comfortable. Would definitely fly with them again.,1
"As a frequent flyer I must recommend flying with Luxair. The planes are a little small and the price is not equal to a budget airline, but then neither is the service offered. Each time I have flown with the airline has been a calm and enjoyable experience. Staff are friendly and helpful. The food provided on the plane is tasty. On any occasion I have made a seat request upon check in it has always been made possible with absolutely no fuss. The security at the airport may not be very chatty but are efficient and it is to this day the fastest security I have been through in any airport.",1
Check in had a glitch when bags were almost checked through to the final destination but was noticed by the porter assigned to us. Told at the lounge no time to enter 40 minutes ahead of take off and we could see the gate a few metres away. Flight itself was uneventful with a professional crew and nice tasting and well presented meals. On time arrival and bags were waiting. All you could want from a domestic flight really.,1
"Denver to Los Angeles. Will never fly Frontier again. 4 hour delay with a gate change 3 hours into the delay. The clerk at the counter was very, very rude to every person waiting. Stewardesses from another Fromtier flight were being very rude to customers. They thought it was funny that we had the delay and proceeded to joke with each other that they hope it's another 4 hours till we can board. Horrible customer service and they expect everyone to pay to check on bags! Frontier is a joke!",0
"Dalaman to Bucharest. I took my flight from Dalaman Turkey to Istanbul. Flight was delayed so long I missed my connecting flight in Istanbul for Romania. It took me 4 hours to find someone at the airport to ""help"" me. She offered to sell me another ticket for a flight 2 days later. I told her it was not my fault I missed my connecting flight to which she said ""You are welcome to go to any other airline."" I ended up having to purchase a very expensive last minute ticket from another airline for 3 times the cost of my entire Pegasus flight. On the flight from Dalaman to Istanbul we were in tiny cramped seats and they only sell food and drinks. Never ever again.",0
"I tried to pay for luggage after checking in online, their platform was down, I tried over and over no result. I went to the airport and stated the issue with their website. Their employee, convinced me to pay the airport Charge, and gave me a number to call and get my refund on the difference. I did just that, and got on the phone with another employee, who to took the matter as a Joke, when I demanded for a serious answer, she gave me an email, which I sent an email to asking for my refund. I got a reply less than a day later that they would not be be refunding the difference.",0
Had a great flight to Seoul and then a transfer onto Auckland. Cannot fault them return journey was just as good and excellent. One thing however is that food onboard is not that good.,1
PNH to REP. Only a short hop but great little carrier with new aircraft pleasant service and good quality snack.,1
"Panama City to Miami and my bag came out damaged. I knew I had to claim the damage immediately upon arrival. In the arrival hall in Miami, there was no counter for Copa Airlines, and some staff told me Copa only had a desk in the departure hall. It was around 22.30 and the departure hall was almost empty. I didn't find any office, and some staff told me there was none. I went to the hotel,and got on a 8 day cruise the next morning. To travel back home again, I had to buy another suitcase. The next week back home again, I found on Copa website that I could claim the damage online. No reply came, and the only way I could find to get in contact with them, was via Twitter. They don't hand out numbers or mail addresses. In order to finally get the response from them, 2 months later, I had to provide them with another email. They then said that I should have made the claim either at the airport or claimed it online within 7 days after. If you enter www.copaair.com, then find Customer service, then Customer care, and then Baggage where you can click on ""claim here"", the form to fill out opens and there is no information about that it should be done within a certain time limit.  I believe that Copa Airlines has a sneaky way of not taking responsibility for their failures.",0
"Good morning. I would like to write a review for British Airways. It took me a while to write this review as I it took me a while to get over what happened to me. But I feel that the way British Airways behaved needs a review for their valiant efforts. Last year I went with my 9 year old son and my 80 year old friend to New Orleans from London on the holiday of a life time. I was pregnant at the time. The baby died while I was on holiday there and I was in a turmoil of emotions. Regardless I tried to make the holiday a positive experience for my son and friend and carried on, all the while just wanting to go home as treatment needed to take place in England. Somehow I missed the flight back. I have no excuse for this. When I realised I was in a complete state. I had a break down. I rang BA and sobbed down the phone. They were beyond amazing! They arranged a flight back home the same day without any extra cost. We all sat together and we were able to fly home that day and I was in hospital the day afterwards. Customer service was outstanding. So compassionate and helpful. And again they did not ask for a penny for our return flights. I am beyond grateful for their help. I will only ever fly BA on long haul if possible.",1
"The staff on this aircraft were polite, kind, and very attentive to people around me, and myself who was not feeling very well. They helped me move to a more spacious seating area as soon as boarding was complete. They were understanding and very quick with service.  I will definitely be flying with Norse again. Thank you",1
"Jakarta to Bali. The original flight I booked was changed, and the new flight allocated to me was no good because I would have missed my international flight. So I contacted AirAsia via the online chat option, and my flight was changed to my preference easily and quickly. Try doing that with Qantas. Many hours later! I arrived for my flight, it was on time, and comfortable. First time I've flown AirAsia, I've heard that they don't have the best name, but I couldn't fault them. From all the staff I met, to the online chat, to the flight, and arriving on time. Thank you AirAsia.",1
"This is the third time I have had my flight cancelled, and bumped to a later flight. I fly to meetings in Quebec, and I kept telling myself, that its just a glitch, stuff happens. But when I ran into my meeting 1.5 hours late because of a Westjet cancellation for the third time, I felt really foolish for using this Airline, when they are consistently unreliable. It has to be any other airline going forward. There is no choice.",0
"Our Volaris flight was delayed 12hrs. Stood in line for check in for 2hrs, where there prior the recommended time, when we arrived they said it was overbooked. False information about time and fishy rebookings to flights after that never showed up so more and more delays. No reliable information and service around the situation. Given you false hope 2hours at the time to avoid compensation. No structure and total chaos so people that waited shorter got flights earlier than you. Poorly handled from beginning to the end. I have never experienced such a poor customer service. Delays can happen but it's how you take care of your customers that matters. Would avoid this airline to any cause. You want to deal with professional people and feel safe and taken care of when these things happens. At least an honest answer regarding the departure so you could do something with the time. ",0
Amsterdam to Abu Dhabi . This turned out to be a great flight. We chose KLM because it was cheaper and this ended up being one of the best flights I've had. The food was really really good and the best food Ive had on a plane. The staff was really friendly and helpful.,1
"We booked our 2 week trip to Cuba from Regina in September 2015 to avoid late flights and to ensure direct flights. We normally only fly direct. Also paid the extra for the option plus. Two weeks before the trip our agent advised that we would be makinking one quick stop in Santa Maria but we would just stay on the plane. The crew never communicated anything during the stop other than to take all our belongings, including all carry ons and exit the plane. While escorted to the terminal we all had to go through security again and then sit and wait an hour. Again no one from the crew communicated anything to us while we waited. We had no idea what was going on. After we all reboarded the crew did not say anything. While at the resort Air Transat staff told us our flight back would be direct. Well not the case. We arrived at the airport to read on the board that our flight was leaving at 18.45, would you believe by 16.30 they were calling for all Regina passengers to board the plane. I quickly ran to find my husband to board. While boarding I could hear other passengers worried about missing their flight due to the earlier departure. After departing guess what? Touch down in Santa Maria, again no communication from the crew until we departed. Also why were our option plus seats in the middle of the plane? What happened to the leisure boarding and unboarding. We feel totally cheated by this so called perk. Definately not good value for money. We had to purchase our meal on way to and from Cuba on plane. We are very dissatisfied with the service and crew.",0
"London City to Berlin on 8th March. Flight got canceled. The lady at the counter was extremely unfriendly and arrogant. Extremely rude staff and service. This is no way to treat passengers!, especially not if the expensive flight is cancelled!",0
I made a reservation with LIAT for January 2016 to fly from San Juan to Dominica. This was a direct flight The reservation was made in June 2015. Without telling me the flight was changed to an overnight flight via Antigua. I had called to check flight times and found out accidentally. I was offered a flight the next day that had 4 stops and took 8 hours. When I tried to cancel all I was offered was a credit!,0
Singapore to Gold Coast. First of all flight was late almost 2 hours. I paid extra to have a seat by the window to have a better sleep. Seat was broken that I couldn't let it down. Asked to put me to sit somewhere else. They said no available seats only if I pay extra to sit in quiet zone or extra leg room. They gave me broken seat what i paid extra already and refused to give me other seat. It would not cost anything to company if they would put me to sit somewhere else.  I wrote to them and it took like a month to respond and all they said was oops sorry we will fix the seat. Like how's that going to help me? Never ever fly with them again!,0
"Very disappointed by United. Their online booking system didn't process our reservation correctly even though I received a confirmation email for my purchase. They never acknowledged that their system was faulty and blamed it on my bank 2 hours before boarding. The bank confirmed that the transaction went through and still United told me there was nothing they could do about it. I then bought a new ticket in front of them and the same problem persisted. Again they blamed it on my bank. Long story short the customer service is completely clueless, they treat you like you a nuisance and won't even apologize for their mistake or for wasting your time. Highly not recommended.",0
"Worst service and food. Seats are small, only 4 cabin crew for 300 people they even sell the headphones if you want to watch a movie bring your own. Also no subtitles available in any language. Took forever for the check in.",0
"Air France was absolutely splendid. Flew from Vancouver to Munich via Paris. We had no issues, they made this long travel time a breeze. The food was great, seats were comfortable. Moreover, when anxiety got the best of me due to an airport issue in Paris, the Air France ladies took me in and took care of me until I was able to calm down. It helped my panic attack immensely and at that point they did not even known that we were flying with them. Offered us seats and water etc. Cannot thank them enough.",1
I use to fly with Ryanair back and forth from Dublin every few weeks. After Ryanair changed their flight times to Dublin which did not help me I changed to Aer Lingus. The staff are friendly and always smiling the planes are comfortable and the times of the flights are fantastic. The prices are always a little higher than the other company's but I would not change back.,1
"Multan to Dubai. one of the worst management i have ever seen, they never fly on time. On return flight my departure time was 3pm and it got delayed and we fly at 9pm. Staff dont care actually even if you are late or not. I reach Dubai next day morning 7 am my flight got delayed almost 7 to 8 hours. I will never fly them again.",0
"More than 4 months ago we bought plane tickets to fly to Havana from Santiago. The original date was November 16 and return on the 23rd of the same month. We bought for that date because we will participate in a congress. We called to Avianca November 5th and they said to us that they change our ticket unilaterally, the new date is November 17 and returns on the 22nd on the same month. I explained to them that this date did not serve me since I lost two days of course and two days of hotel but they were not able to offer me any solution besides that they do not want to reimburse the money thay we spend for those two days me for the hotel and the course.",0
JetBlue canceled my flight in the interim of me Checking in. This Is the second time in a a years time that they did this to me. I was on a trip with my kids last year for my birthday as well and they left me stranded without options to get from Miami to Boston now from Charlotte to Boston. c.,0
"Ibiza to London Stansted on easyJet was a really good flight. Paid extra for legroom and speedy boarding. Well worth it. Newish aircraft staffed by friendly efficient crew. Flew Ryanair on outward leg, and easyJet experience was far superior. Impressed and will use again.",1
"Perth to Doha. Upon boarding, personal steward escorted me to seat and offered me a drink. A case containing Italian toiletries was waiting at the seat. We were offered pyjamas and slippers for the flight. Seat can be converted into a flat bed. Good selection of meals with a large selection of wines. Amazing lounge is fantastic for stretching out the legs. Entertainment and inflight shopping selections are wide. However, inflight shopping is quite expensive. Despite the large business class numbers, we continued to have very attentive service throughout the flight and I was actually able to sleep well on the flight. This is my first time on QR business and I am extremely impressed. I will definitely fly Qatar Airways again.",1
"Manila to Hong Kong return. Had a family vacation in Hong Kong via Cathay Pacific. Appreciate the fact that we were upgraded to Premium Economy. The seat is big and legroom is spacious. Can't complain even if the meal served was the same as those in the Economy Class. The aircraft is new and very clean. Noise coming from the engine was very minimal. Overall, I was happy flying Cathay Pacific. Wifi onboard is available for a fee.",1
"Qantas online booking charge me 3 times my air fares. I've try to call Qantas to get my money back without any success. First call they could not find their own booking reference, put me on hold, after 35min waiting in the queue, then communication finished without warning after 20more minute on hold. 2nd call, 30min waiting time, hang up as soon as I've been connected to an operator. 3rd call, 30min waiting time, then get in touch with an operator who still can't find the booking reference, then tell me that I've to process a claim on line. I explain he that I'm not claiming any thing, I want them to give me my money back. She told me again with any more information, webpage, phone number or else where to make the claim. I've repeat that they are the one at fault so they should look into it, I'm not paid to solve their mistake. I've ask her to connect me to her manager or the competent department, she ask me to go the the website, without no further explanation, I've told her no, I want to speak to a manager, she said ok, and put me on hold during 40more minute. She put me on hold 4 or 5 time each time the queue was bringing back. At the end the call was terminated with the usual satisfaction question. Obviously the operator was looking at wasting time because I insisting in talking to a person.",0
"Alicante to Liverpool. Awful experience at the airport, queued for the full 2 hours at the airport. Passports checked 3 times. No time for a coffee never mind breakfast. Get your act together Ryanair!",0
Flight from Cairo to Beijing. Old Business Class the seats were not comfortable at all. The legroom was like in Economy. The First Class cabin also seemed to offer less comfort than Business normally does. Food was ok. The only advantage is the good value for money.,0
"Sunwing is awful. The champagne service is a joke. The ads show a champagne glass filled with champagne and they even say ""Bon voyage glass of sparkling wine"" meanwhile it is about an ounce of sparkling wine in a plastic cup you would expect salad dressing to be served in. I mean can't they even use the plastic wine cups? So misleading. Furthermore the ""hotel towel service"" is nothing more than a small wet napkin that has been warmed up. The seats were terribly uncomfortable and small. My last flight the air regulator was broken and it was stifling on the flight. I will never willingly fly Sunwing again! Also no TVs on the back of seats so bring your glasses if you get stuck in a row that is far from the nearest TV. The food was awful.",0
"Santa Ana to Denver. It would be impossible for a flight that lands back on the ground to be any worse. Frontier consistently, trip after trip, does a terrible job. Horrible website. Nickel and dime you for everything. Rude under trained staff. Bad flight times. I honestly think that they hate their customers. It would be impossible for them to design a worse travel experience. If there is ver an opportunity to take another airline I will.",0
If there was a way to rate this company's service to a score less than 1 I would do that. I booked my flight all confirmed connecting through Chicago. In Chicago after a gate change and an hour delay they cancelled the flight to my destination. No options no direction just cancelled. Then after 30 min on the call I talked to them for rebooking. Nothing available. I got someone at a kiosk to help and they booked me on a flight 2 DAYS later whereas I had to be at a conference the next morning. Needless to say that was not an option. I rented a car and drove 10 hours straight to my destination getting to my destination at 4am. Then it is time to get back home and they tell me they have canceled my return ticket because I did not complete my trip. No warning no notification nothing. Just cancelled. So I had to pay for another ticket to get back home. There were many people like me on that plane. People from across the world who couldn't even speak English and they were lost and confused. I ended up helping one of them. There is no excuse for this. This is the worst none customer service oriented company I have ever dealt with. Avoid this airline by all means even if you have to pay a little more to go with another airline.,0
"Delhi to Cairo via Riyadh. Under these unfortunate circumstances of coronavirus, I cancelled my ticket under the cancellation policy but they never returned my money. One they ask to call their call centers but they have ghost centers because no one picks up a phone there. Further I kept on chasing them on mails, even copying there top management but no one is giving heed to it. On my scripted replies which are of no use. They say that my money is kept with them for 1 year to be used in future and if not used within that 1 year it will be confiscated. I mean that's absurd.",0
Took 9 hours to get home. Southwest kept delaying my flight. No one around to answer questions. This is totally ridiculous. I need a response to what went on before I fly Southwest again.,0
"On short notice Allegiant Air canceled my flight. Initially they said there would be a delay because a mechanic was needed. The delay expanded over 3 hours at which point the flight was canceled. They refused to bring in a replacement plane and crew. The entire treatment was not very transparent or caring and we lost half a day just sitting in the airport not to mention reclaiming our bags. By the way we booked only a few days prior and our fare was not discounted. It was ruinous of my trip and my time off. Never again will I fly out of Fort Wayne, nor will I fly Allegiant. Pathetic. Poor management.",0
"I booked a round trip flight through this airlines Sao Paulo to Santo Domingo via Mexico City, I called to change the return date of the return flight, minus 1 day. They did that. But come flight day, I found out that that instead of just changing the return date, they also cancelled the departure flight. It became a one way flight and just the return, Sto Domingo to Brazil. And then I had to call them again to have them fix it, i had to be moved to a different day, so I had to change the succeeding flights I'm supposed to have after that flight that they cancelled. I also had to do multiple covid tests because of the rescheduling that happened. And they did not make it easy for me as well, when I called to have them book the flight that they cancelled, they keep on transferring me, refusing to give me a supervisor, and then hanging up on me, I called multiple times in a day, spent almost 2 hours just for them to fix it. I gave all the information they asked for. They phone reps are also rude, very unprofessional and keeps on insisting things on me, offering to change my flight dates, things that I already specifically asked to not do. They are also not apologetic of the inconvenience, of their mistake. of all the stress they brought me. None. They refuse to give any compensation for all the problems they brought. Then comes the flight day, the ticket is cancelled again. They never called me or sent email. No nothing. Then 1 hour after they cancelled the ticket, I received an email notice in the same format as a purchase confirmation, it says you're cleared off and ready for takeoff to Sto Domingo, and there was just a note at the very bottom, that they voided the ticket because they need information, asking me to call them back.",0
"Flew to Nashville via Chicago in first. Excellent check in and security. Lounge was good. Food and drink choices very good. First cabin on 787 is 8 seats. Comfortable seat, entertainment a little clunky. Cabin service top banana!! Food and drinks choices and tastes amazing for an aircraft. A special call out to Stewart Tim. A credit to BA.",1
"The Boeing 787 seat pitch and size of seats are miserable. Seats are so cramped, passengers have no place to stretch. Some of the seats are close to lavatories that passengers are uncomfortably close.",0
"Varanasi to Kolkata. Cabin was clean, the crew friendly and helpful. The food served in flight was tasty. We enjoyed the flight.",1
LHR to BKK return. Both legs were very good. Worth every penny and can not falter anything on the flights.,1
"Once again we flew with VietJet Air to Hanoi from Siem Reap. Great service as always, I had a very pleasant flight with a low cost. We must say we love the new pre order service where you can make sure products are available. Planes were clean and comfortable and felt roomy too, a lot better than some of the bigger airlines!",1
London to Izmir via Istanbul with Turkish Airlines for the first time and  they are the best airline I've flown. The cabin crew were incredibly kind and helpful as I was very nervous as I was travelling alone for the first time. They took good care of me and the food was superb.,1
"London to Vancouver via Paris. Clean and beautiful cabin on the Boeing 777 with reasonable space between the seats, flight attendants were smiling and friendly. The lunch was served approximately 2 hours after take off, food was delicious and cabin crews were attentive during service. Many movies and music albums on the inflight entertainment kept me occupied during this 10 hours flight. Enjoy very much flying with Air France.",1
"Melbourne to Hobart. I should learn time and time again to not fly with this joke of an airline but alas here we are again! Every single time I fly with them about 10x in the last 2 years the flight has been delayed. Never has it ever been on time. My birthday was totally ruined in April a long weekend in Perth ended up being about a day in Perth, lost money on car, hotels everything because they outright cancelled the flight and rebooked another 6 hours later. Compensation? whats that? My flight today is not until 6.30pm tonight and already at 12pm its been delayed so no doubt that will be much later than anticipated. Seriously what is the issue with this airline? the flights are not even that cheap!",0
"San Diego to London, an excellent flight with really good Club World service from crew. The crew in the upper deck knew their jobs, anticipated requirements and smiled when delivering service, no complaints and a decent nights sleep. They knock US airlines into a cocked hat and I should know as I had the bitter experience during my stateside trip.",1
LAX to Mexico City to Cancun round trip. Staff at LAX Mexico City and Cancun were very helpful and patient. FA's on each leg were kind and helpful. Boarding very fast and efficient and they boarded according to rows back to front. The seats were as comfortable as any other economy class airline. There is only economy class. The snacks were your choice of chips and drinks were free not just soda and juice but also beer and mix drinks. We were a party of 5 and we checked 5 bags and were all within the weight limit. Upon return 1 bag got left in Mexico City at Customs it was delivered to our home the following day. I was very sceptical about flying Volaris after reading so many negative reviews however when you are a family of 5 I had to go with the most economic. I will not hesitate to fly Volaris again.,1
"Buyer beware. There are no benefits to flying first class with Delta. No lounge access, ""lunch"" was a revolting microwaved to death rancid piece of chicken, and the seat no better than an emergency exit seat. No separate cabin. Quite how they get away with this given their misleading marketing is beyond me. Avoid avoid avoid. Rip off merchants.",0
"Flew Hong Kong to Bangkok. Despite getting negatives review Emirates is getting these days, my flights to and from Hong Kong went so smoothly. On both flights crew were lovely, smiling and efficient. This A380 had the first class removed and replaced with economy in the front of the upper deck. A bit odd but makes good sense, as the lounge bar is at the back, cutting economy class at the back will not make sense at all. 20K is a lovely window bulkhead seat, feels really private, everything is perfect working order. Welcome drinks and hot towels, crew were cheerful and happy to engage in a little chit chat. Wifi is free and unlimited, if you are a skyward member travelling in business and first class, regardless of the tire level. Connection is fairly good throughout most of the flights. Meals were delivered with everything on one tray, nice presentation and good taste. Champagne and all kind of alcoholic drinks are plentiful and free flowing should you require. Both flights were under 3 hours, sweet but short. With such competitive price comparing to other airlines, I have no hesitation to choose EK on this route, and also to the Middle East and Europe.",1
Flew last week to Gran Canaria flight was a bit late leaving plane packed. Flight back late paid for seats for me and my son found other passengers in our seats so crew seated us in other seats. Really disorganised when I contacted Thomas Cook about this they said that we had sat in our booked seats although there was no way of them knowing this as non of the crew knew our names or even where we were sitting.,0
"Krakow to Warsaw on Embraer 195. After security at Krakow Airport I had around 2 hours to spare so I spent it plane spotting as there is nothing to do while waiting. The seating was full so if you find a seat you would be best to stay seated as you will have difficulty finding another. We boarded the aircraft using one of the newly installed jet bridges at Krakow Airport, LOT is one of the few airlines that use them.  While we were waiting to pushback the crew ran through the safety demo and handed out snacks, which was a wafer. The seat was soft and comfy, the seat reclined slightly. The drinks were handed out, tea, coffee and water. At Warsaw we deboarded using the jet bridge. I had around 4 hours to spend at Warsaw before catching a flight home to Aberdeen. Overall the flight was amazing and LOT did not disappoint me. In my opinion LOT is the best airline if travelling in Poland and can be cheaper than the train or bus, even with connections. The flight was very cheap and was definitely worth paying the price.",1
"I flew on a business trip to Ulan Bator from Hong Kong. The ticket price was really good! The crew and staff were attentive and catered to my requests, which wasn't much, but they're a good airline that I wish flew to more destinations,",1
"Chiang Mai to Bangkok. The boarding in Chiang Mai was a chaotic mess, and upon arrival in BKK there was no bus ready and we waited 20 minutes in the plane. Then the baggage took more than 1 hour to reach the carousel. All told, the waiting was longer than the  flight. No one from came to the carousel to let us know and there was no announcement, but their office is near the domestic baggage carousels and the staff in there were utterly clueless and disinterested.",0
"My wife and I flew 3 times with Tigerair Australia during October 2015, first to Cairns then to Sydney and back to Melbourne. They exceeded our expectations, everything was smooth from check in to baggage claim and on time or ahead of time. No hesitation to recommend Tigerair.",1
San Francisco to Copenhagen on the new route. You could see that the plane was old and the Entertainment system was old! Seats were good. The food was good and the personnel friendly. The stewardess told me when I was getting my free drink with my food that there wouldn't be anything to drink before the last meal 8 hours later so if I wanted it I could get another drink so I got 2 cokes. I have been on most airlines between Europe and USA and SAS was definitely one of the better. I will definitely fly SAS again.,1
"I would personally not recommend this airline. Really bad customer service at Delhi airport. Once in air, service appalling and the food was bad.",0
"Delhi to Thiruvananthapuran. We had checked in on line and paid for extra leg room seats 11E and 11F. When we arrived at the airport the departure board showed that we needed to check our baggage at desk G. When we went to the queue we were told to go desk F,which we did under the sign that said checked baggage only. However the display clearly stated that this row was for international flights and when we queried this with at least a further Air India staff, they all said the same thing. The queue was long and slow and we appeared to be the only non Indian people in the queue. It just didn't seem right, so I went back the the first person who had directed me from desk G to F who then amazingly said I should go the desk G. I refused to do this and insisted that she check me in. She just glared at me and it was only I complained to her colleague that they agreed top do this. After a lot of muttering between them that printed tickets for seats 27A and 27B. I pointed out that I had paid for 11E and 11F, and again after further muttering a dirty looks I eventually got thje right seats. At no time did they apologise or make eye contact. This is the worst treatment we have had from any airline.",0
"I visited my daughter in June and the Delta Air Lines crew were very helpful and professional. I had recently had unexpected surgery earlier in the week and was having so much pain, I called and asked if I could have my flight moved up so I could go home earlier. After I gave them the information to prove my situation they were incredibly kind, and helped me move up the date. I again recently called them because I had purchased tickets for some family members and these had to be changed, and again were kind and refunded my tickets. They went above and beyond and I am very grateful for their kindness. ",1
"Austin to Detroit. I just want to make note that Corean was an awesome flight attendant, love her humor she uses well to grab your attention. She was very pleasant and polite which made the flight that more enjoyable. Great flying skills goes out to the pilot as well.",1
What a ridiculous flight. My husband and I had to first had to wait over an hour to check our bags from Colorado to Alaska. Then our flight was over an hour late because of delays loading luggage. We missed our connecting flight and we had to wait in Anchorage with our three month old son for 8 hours. We didn't get a meal voucher or anything. The staff that worked for United told us that we weren't entitled and it was too bad. They gave everyone free movie on the plane but my husbands didn't work. I had already paid for a movie so it didn't matter on my screen. Will not be flying United again.,0
Melbourne to Bangkok. Very good flight friendly flight attendants and a tight connection in Brunei made easily. Seats were comfortable. No problems food was good and plentiful. No alcohol served but told I could have taken a bottle of wine. Happily fly them again.,1
Flight to Karachi from Multan. The Airbus used for the journey was old and there wasn't any IFE present but the cabin had a nice ambience to it. The flight attendents were very nice and pleasant. The IFM was so so but you can't complain about it. Take off and landing were was smooth. I will definitely be flying with Shaheen International again.,1
"Aeroflot is based in Russia where bad weather in winter is not uncommon and for pasengers to endure 12 hour delay overnight in Moscow airport due to weather conditions is unacceptable. The worst way of dealing with delayed passengers, offering them a 7EUR voucher for making them miss their correspondance. Overall very poor quality with no inflight entertainment from London to Moscow.",0
The portions of the meals as well as quality of the meals were extremely poor.  10.5 hours of flight and only two snacks and one small lunch with no vegetables or fruits.  The other sandwich was piece of bread with spaghetti sauce in the middle and nothing else. To make the matters worse none of the USB chargers were working and my TV was not working either. There was a message saying that it needs to be replaced. Our kids were hungry and cranky the entire flight. We travel this route several times a year but this was our last time flying with Lufthansa.,0
I am writing a review because my daughter's and 4 of my grand children all ages 3 yrs old to newborn got dropped off at the airport for their return flight home to Detroit today. Upon checking in they were told their flight is delayed due to weather related issues. This airline needs to accommodate passengers if they are delayed due to weather. My kids and grand kids should not be stranded in a airport overnight. The airport didn't try to accommodate them and put them on another airline or anything. The same way they are willing to accept payment they should be willing to accommodate passengers. Who wants to be stranded or sleep in an airport with 4 children? Then I just spent 3 hours on hold trying to speak with someone.,0
"Atlanta to Punta Cana via Ft Lauderdale. Incredibly inefficient process with Spirit Airlines. Bag checkin took an hour and half. Original flight from Atlanta to Fort Lauderdale delayed by one hour. This resulted in personal telling us we would not make connecting flight to Dominican Republic through Spirit airlines. They only had one available seat the next day and could not get our family of four to Dominican Republic until two days later. There was a complete line of people with the same problem. Spirit Airlines attendants were rude, unhelpful and had attitude of disinterest. I cancelled and asked for full refund of ticket price.",0
"London Stansted to Barcelona. I fly Ryanair regularly but they have a new policy of seating people apart when they buy tickets together, just to charge more money. I was flying with my wife, we checked in in advance and saw that they sat us apart even though there were plenty of seats free. The flight was actually far from full, both seats next to me were free when I got there, but they still would give us separate seats. They are going back to being the cheap inconsiderate company they were before! I will always try to avoid them from now on.",0
Newark to Cincinnati. Maintains a very bad quality of service in all aspects. Customer service is not at all satisfying nor try to make any convincing to customers. Most delayed airline I have ever seen.,0
"Flight was short, as actual flight is less than an hour, but full service provided. Juice selection for welcome drink on board and hot towel provided before take off. It was great refreshment. Hot meal also provided with cold and hot drink choices.",1
"Amsterdam to Atlanta. It was a good flight with good legroom, food and IFE. But the service is not the best for Economy. KLM have a little selection of music and movies.",1
"Service in business class was appalling the attendant ""forgot"" to lay my table the first and second courses I had to remind her each time. Both my husband and I were not offered water or beverage refills after landing they didn't even bother to acknowledge the passengers as we were leaving. We travel business class on many different airlines my husband is a million mile flyer and this was the worst experience. Our flight was OS93 on September 2 2014 from Vienna to Washington DC.",0
"Toronto to Manila return, and is a big improvement for Philippine Airlines, with onboard cabin service, free 30 min.On Air Wifi. Inflight meal are now available of your choice in the menu, more movies, tv shows and music now than my previous flight 3 years ago. Good legroom in the economy seat for a 5ft 9ins tall guy like me. Friendly and polite cabin crew.",1
"Air France  from Shanghai Pudong to Paris CDG. Check in handled by China Eastern which was inefficient and very slow, nothing to say about Pudong Airport T1 as its a mess Lounge is good with plenty of hot food and drinks. Onboard the Air France A380 I was in the last row on upper decor, nice AVOD and comfortable seat, very friendly cabin crew. Dinner served with complimentary champagne, fresh fruit and snacks a available during the midnight. Arrived at CDG on time.",1
"Chicago to Ho Chi Minh City via Seoul. Flight with Asiana Airlines was very comfortable with great service and inflight food. My flight was overnight and allowed me to sleep on my normal schedule and arrive refreshed. I will definitely add this to my list of preferred airlines. Seats are spaced for great leg room and the seat width is comfortable for a 6 foot, 240 pound man.",1
"Bergen to Keflavik via Copenhagen. Terrible flight, ridiculous staff. Three men that seem to not know what they were doing and when asked for water they said it should wait. When the trolley came, the guy gave very few water. When asked for more he said only 1 cup of water per person. SAS should provide enough water for all passengers. Ridiculous company. I'll never fly SAS again.",0
Cleveland to Tampa. Spirit Airlines is awful! I will never consider flying on this airline again. I cancelled before the 23 hour period but I did not receive a refund. I received a small credit.  Fly at your own risk and money over integrity. No matter what. I will reschedule but not with them.,0
"San Jose to Beijing. For the airport experience, the check in is prompt and very smooth, check in agents were nice and polite. HU placed plenty of ground staff that are able to speak multiple Chinese dialect, Putonghua, Cantonese etc. The lounge is the only one in San Jose airport, but the food selection is great and  shower facility spacious. Boarding process was smooth, business class passengers were boarded as the beginning. The cabin crew in my section performed an excellent service, she took very good care of passengers. She proactively offer food, drinks and amenity. The selection of movie is inadequate. Only contains many old movies, and lacking of choices, I was hardly to find a suitable movie to spend my 12 hours flight.",1
"I flew with the carrier for the first time in March 2016, from Dublin to Los Angeles. I am a frequent flyer, and have at some stage used most of the main international carriers, and this is the first time I have ever felt the need to go to the trouble of writing a poor review for an airline. The outbound flight was rescheduled at the last minute, meaning I arrived just over an hour late to LAX. Subsequently I missed the connecting flight which was Alaska Airlines. They told us to contact Ethiopian, who should have checked us in all the way to our final destination at Dublin airport but had refused to do so. We spent an our on the phone to Ethiopian customer services, as they had no representation at all at LAX. The person dealing with us on the phone was incredibly rude. Eventually he agreed that Ethiopian would pay for and book us on another flight, we were instructed to go back to Alaska Airlines. When we discussed what we were told with them, they said the method suggested was impossible. Luckily Alaska airline were extremely helpful and gave us change of seat fare instead of full fare, on the next flight available, which was actually from Orange County airport the next day, which cost us shuttle bus and hotel. As for the flights themselves, our screens did not work in either outbound or return flight and the crew seemed to think this was normal on a 10 hour flight. I had to clean the toilet on my flight home to use it, as every toilet on the aircraft after 4 hours into the flight was dirty. I am the least fussy eater but I can say the food was not even recognisable for some meals, I suggest bringing your own snacks. Finally the most concerning point, when waiting to leave LA, there was some kind of technical trouble, so we sat on the aircraft for two hours before leaving, late again of course. The problem was, before leaving we received no safety demo. None of the crew came around to inspect the cabin configuration for take off, my friend was fast asleep with her seat reclined as we started to head down runway. Ethiopian Airlines is the first airline I have ruled out so far. The flights were more expensive than other carriers but the quality is not up there with the big carriers I'm afraid. Shame as its a convenient route for me, but the good new is Aer Lingus are starting an LAX route soon.",0
"Very good flight with Cathay Pacific Airways from London. Lots of space. Good food for economy class. The staff was very professional and gave good service. No delays. My luggage arrived with me in Brisbane. London Heathrow airport is always stressful, but Cathay Pacific Airways had a good service to help us changing terminals.",1
"Bali to Tokyo via Singapore. I had the worst experience during check in at Bali international airport. I was flying back home using 2 different airlines, no baggage, terminals I fly in is the same I fly out, all airports I fly in have transit zone.  The employee of scoot refused to give me my boarding pass cause I did not have visa to Japan, I did not need visa in this case I could easily transfer to my next flight without leaving the terminal. After asking him for a while to verify everything he was just sitting there and replying all the same ""I cannot"" . I asked to give me my boarding pass only to Singapore and he told me I cant get it as well cause I need flight back and if I buy a new ticket in front of him he can give it to me otherwise I wont get anything and simply losing all my flights. I asked for a manager and he refused to call the manager or somebody, I asked to provide me a complaint form and he refused to do so, he refused to give even a phone call to somebody who knows more then him.  All I wanted is to go home and not being stuck in Indonesia. Somehow I was able to get my boarding pass to Singapore from other agent who was very nice an understanding, she checked everything and verified that I actually can get my boarding pass. Thanks to other employee I was able to fly home without problems. As a company who are involved in international flights every employee should be familiar with every aspect of international travels. It is very serious for many people to be where they need to be on time. Please make sure your employees are not refusing people boarding passes and please be more understanding even if you are a budget airline.",0
"The TV, music and wifi service was not working. When we landed, we sat on the Tarmac for 45 minutes with the smell of jet fuel in the cabin. It was a horribly long and uncomfortable wait that made us late",0
"My paid cabin bag was 1cm too long but several cm below the height and depth limits. However the ground staff would not let me bring it on the plane and it was sent to the hold with a 30 euro excess. On the plane the luggage racks were half empty. This militant fund raising exercise is ridiculous. I had bright the exact Same bag on the incoming leg a few days earlier. Oh, and both flights were over two hours late.",0
Never again. Horrible seats. Very hard and don't recline. Asked 5 people in Orlando where to find a pet relief area and they all gave me the run around and acted annoyed that I asked and just kept telling me to ask someone else. Toddler screaming the whole flight and flight attendants didn't offer anything like on other airlines.,0
Flew Allegiant Air from Orlando to Chattanooga. This airline is absolutely awful no other way to put it. I've been sitting on the runway for a longer duration than my entire flight. All I can say is I will never be flying Allegiant again and I suggest you do the same if you don't want a similar experience.,0
Trip to Orlando from Ohio was delayed for an hour due to the plane arriving late and mechanical issues. Trip to Columbus from Orlando was delayed over an hour for the same reasons. Their seats are miserable and their logistics must be awful.,0
"Orlando to Hamilton. Swoop has great prices on flights but that is because they lack on everything else especially customer service. I asked a few questions on Facebook and they replied within a day. But once I mentioned my luggage was damaged, they never opened my messages again. It's been 6 days. I've even tried to post on their most recent posts and I see them actively replying other people but me. There are many other posts with other people complaining about being on hold for over 2 hours and still not getting anyone on the other line. You're lucky if everything goes smoothly. But good luck to you if something is wrong because Swoop doesn't care.",0
April 10 QF10 Dubai to Melbourne. I have been a Qantas customer and frequent flyer for many years. On this particular trip together with my 9 year old son coming back from a holiday in Europe the disappointment with this leg of the flight was big. We been pampered from Frankfurt to Dubai by Emirates and then continued on Qantas back home. During this 13 hour flight the provision of food and drinks was poor. No child meal despite request one warm meal 11 hours after boarding before only snags and one pizza slice. No trace of the crew occasionally they pass through. The one warm meal was just one aluminium tray no sides. The service on QF10 was to be expected from a budget airline but here we paid well above the budget flights. Never again QF on international.,0
"The flight to San Francisco was ok but with less than half full, but the flight back to Phoenix was scheduled to take off at 4 pm Monday the 6th, the flight was first delayed to 8 pm from 4pm , then 10pm. The problem is that the airline doesn't have enough workers and passengers, they are cheap but at a cost.",0
"Munich to Johannesburg with South African Airways. A broken seat with no alternative, so 10.5 hours of extreme discomfort. The ground staff who cover the spectrum from disinterested to downright rude. No service orientation and a severe attitude problem. Waiting for my return flight at this moment. Delayed indefinitely and not a word from South African Airways about why, when etc.",0
"Denver to Tampa. After a 3 hour delay the flight was canceled, I get it. But I was then told I could fly out in two days, nope that flight was over booked and we got set back another day. The night of the canceled flight, the people at the ticket counter were rude, condescending and of No help! One lady had No clue what she was doing and the guy I spoke to was an ass. We were told we could pay for another flight on another airline but, wouldn't get our refunds for 7 days. They acked like everything was going to be ok because they gave us vochers Only to be used with Frontier, so we shouldn't be mad. Keep your vouchers, I will Never fly frontier again..Ever! Their customer service is absolutely awful, the seats are uncomfortable and nasty. I dont understand how they stay in business! The money you may save using them is Not worth the hassle, rudeness or discomfort at all!",0
"Portland to Frankfurt. Excellent value. Expected to have a miserable experience for such a low fare, but both flight out and return were wonderful. Even food was better than higher cost airlines. The only downside is 30"" legroom, but it wasn't uncomfortable.",1
Minneapolis to New Orleans. This is the worst airline I have ever used and would not recommend it to anyone. Our flight was delayed two hours on the way to our destination and two hours on the way home without an explanation. My son came in tonight from Colorado and his flight was delayed three hours. Again without an explanation. Very expensive to check a bag. Flight crew was not friendly. Horrible horrible service. Do not fly with Sun Country Airlines.,0
United overbooked my flight. They asked me to take a later flight to Hawaii when I refused they changed my flight anyway which gave me a five hour wait at the SF airport. They offered nothing for this inconvenience and acted as if they were doing me a favor. This was my first and last trip on United.,0
"Athens to Thira. Avoid this airline at all costs! I've flown a lot and this was the worst experience and worst company I've ever had to deal with. They cancelled our flight super last minute when everyone was already at the airport. Then, they wouldn't help anyone find any other flights and when we called customer service they said word for word ""We can't help you you'll have to call back tomorrow"". Now, fast forward 2 months and I'm still chasing them down for my refund! What an absolute joke and total scam. I will never fly this airline and I'll be sure to spread the word as much as possible and tell others to avoid it at all costs as well.",0
"As a first time flyer on Jetstar to Phuket I was pleasantly surprised. Flights out of Sydney always seem to leave late no matter which airline I have flown and this flight's departure was no exception.  The crew were very good as was the quality of the food, headphones and online movies. The bathrooms were clean. The outbound flight received a few complaints about running out of cheesecake for dessert but that was not the crew's fault. I flew business class which is not the same as business class on other airlines but comparable. The under leg supports only came up to mid calf which was very uncomfortable. The inbound flight check in crew and arrangements for check in at Phuket airport, did puzzle me. All business class and economy class passengers were in the same queue which is not normal. As Jetstar is a subsidiary of Qantas I expected fairly fluent English to be spoken at the airport. They were polite but understanding of English was far from good. All people checking in were from Europe or Russian and they all communicated in English. They looked at my passport and asked me if it was ""New"" when it clearly showed in it that it had been issued in 2013. It did not show up on their system which was strange as it did when I had arrived two weeks earlier. One very helpful staff member called the Australian Embassy for clearance. The only error made was the announcement by one of the cockpit crew when we were descending in to Sydney. He was English speaking but announced that we were ""Ascending"" which I found quite amusing.",1
Edmonton to Abottsford. I'm sitting here in the Edmonton airport as I write this waiting for my flight which has been delayed 3 hours. I guess you get what you pay for but I would not recommend you use this airline if you value being on time to your destination. 3 times flying with them and 3 times delayed. Big problem with delayed and cancelled flights with swoop!,0
Houston to Santa Ana. Thanks to Southwest in Houston. I am travelling with a friend who was on a different flight landing at a different airport and the excellent Southwest personnel at gate 41 was able to accommodate us on the same flight. Thanks so much Southwest! Favorite US airline.,1
"As we fly interstate on a regular basis and have only recently encountered Rex Airlines, this service has taken a means of getting from one destination to another level. We have had the pleasure of flying both Business and Economy so can give feed back on the fabulous and unique service across the aircraft. The Cabin Crew are attentive, enthusiastic, warm and friendly and display a genuine interest in their passengers. Business Class was above and beyond. The service was exceptional, all beverages were generously replenished. The food was delicious and might I say the best we have consumed on any airline. . Economy Class we felt very welcomed. The complimentary drinks and snacks consisted of quality produce.  We are extremely pleased that Rex has extended their routes allowing us the pleasure of supporting them. Rex has definitely set the bar high here in Australia and we look forward to seeing the smiling friendly faces of crew and ground staff on our frequent trips. Offering a fare price point for domestic travel may enable us to enjoy a luxury upgrade on a more regular basis.",1
"Vueling Airlines from Florence to Gatwick. The worst flight experience of my life. It was chaos with late boarding, and then on arrival to find no luggage. It doesn't get any worse, and if you have a choice, do not fly Vueling Airlines!",0
"I enjoyed Emirates inflight entertainment system. Flight attendants were polite and nice, food was excellent and tasty and seats were very comfortable. However I found that many lavatories had waste or even used papers and garbage on the floors and the flight attendants failed to clean it.",1
"Prague to Oslo. Anytime I fly with Norwegian the flight is delayed. The customer service is not helpful and they do not provide any compensation for transport. Yesterday I arrived to Oslo over 2 hours late, which would not be an issue, if I would not arrive in the time of no public transport service.",0
"Dubai to Hong Kong via Manila. Very bad customer service, the flight got delayed in Dubai 1 hour and in Manila 5 hours, going back delayed for 2 hours. Very tight seats and air conditioning very poor .",0
Absolutely ridiculous! I tried to book a flight for me and my grandson. I had to modify my flight and was double charged. As I had purchased my travel insurance I thought I would receive a refund. Instead I'm given a credit for half of the amount! This cancelation is 90 days before my flight. As I waited on hold for 30 minutes the agent informs me it should have been only 24 hours before my flight for a refund and the service fees were 335.00. First of all there's plenty of time to fill my reservation from someone else and the service fees are outrageous.,0
"Due to Coronavirus and that Qantas had cancelled my flight, I booked a flight with Qatar Airways and was able to get on a seat pretty much immediately to fly back to Australia. Being a last minute booking and being vegan I wasn't able to choose my preference online but the staff were amazing and were able to put a vegan meal together for my flights. Really good flight and service during a stressful time.",1
"I had a flight from Milan to Tel Aviv with them. After seeing my American passport and asking some personal questions, they took me to check in and changed my exit seat that I paid for so now I'm sitting on the very last seat in this terrible, very old airplane. They also told me to arrive early at the gate because there will be extra security check before boarding. Their ""security check"" was the most embarrassing thing that could happen to anyone. I will never suggest it to anyone.",0
"7th May from Jakarta to Denpasar Bali. Flight QZ7532. Every single time I flew AA the flight was delayed. They usually use a random excuse like ""delay due to the late arrival of the aircraft"". This time 15 min before boarding I asked if the flight was on time. I was extremely surprised to hear that yes the flight was on time. 10 min before departure I enquired again as I couldn't see the airplane at the gate. Only then I was told that the flight was 2 hours delayed. As a pilot myself I know that staying on schedule is not always easy but being late by that much without having the ground staff to inform the passengers on PA I thought that was extremely bad. They can't care less about their passengers.",0
"We flew with Transavia from Munich to Tel Aviv and return. All together there were nine of us with children. The service was good, the aircraft was clean, the staff were friendly and the departure was on time both ways. Overall we were very satisfied and will probably fly with them again.",1
My wife and I recently flew Melbourne to Shanghai via Guangzhou and our return flight was Beijing to Melbourne via Guangzhou. We could not fault the crew's attitude and service or the aircraft's facilities. It was a perfect way to start and end an amazing China holiday.,1
"Frontier canceled my last flight back to Orlando 2 days ago. Tonight, after not showing up to my work, I need to travel and they had delayed the flight twice and changed gates too. Apparently, we will board. It I am so stressful and disappointed.",0
"Boston to Raleigh. We had a mechanical difficulty with the plane we were on, causing us to deplane. I thought it would take forever to schedule another flight, but Jetblue had us on another plane within an hour. It was amazing and very courteous staff that turned a possible flight nightmare to a very well planned departure for the circumstances.",1
Charges to print your boarding pass! Our flight was delayed for several hours with no explanation or indication of time for delay. Communication is key. The representatives do not seem to care about the customer. This is a quick way to go out of business. We will never use this airline again.,0
"Bangkok to Sydney. Booked and paid for full fare business class seat on EK418. Checked in on line and printed a boarding pass. On arrival at Bangkok airport was told that they were overbooked and I would be downgraded to economy. After some time was offered a return business class ticket, Sydney to Bangkok return to be used by October 2019. Not happy but accepted the deal as I needed to be in Sydney. Now, at the end of January I called to redeem my voucher for a flight on August 19th, returning to Sydney 15th. As Emirates have changed their schedule they now refuse to honour the voucher. They have available seats on Qantas code share from Sydney but flatly refuse to accept their own voucher. Emirates did infer that they may be able to offer a Jetstar code share out of Melbourne. This is completely unacceptable. I note that Emirates are cutting back flights to Australia. Perhaps the magic of the Emirates reputation is starting to fade, with this type of attitude it is likely to fade further.",0
Gold Coast to Kuala Lumpur. No inflight entertainment. Seats are rock hard and sit too upright. Absolutely freezing so make sure you bring a coat as they charge you for a blanket. They entice you into a flight with great prices to realise they charge extra for everything a full service airline give you as standard.,0
Frontier airlines was the 2nd part of our journey to our vacation in Seattle to be honest our first flight was with AA and that was horrible. The crew on AA nothing memorable but Frontier staff were so pleasant. I made sure when booking our flights that the connecting flights were at least 2hrs apart the service on Frontier was great and I will definitely fly with them again but this time we'll upgrade to more leg room. My Husband and I were quite happy and will use this airline again whenever we can.,1
"Hanoi to Da Nang. VietJet Air changed our tickets to a cheaper and later flight without any notice and, besides refusing to return the flight cost difference, they also charged us more for luggage. While we were waiting to complain, 3 more passengers reported the same issue on different flights and routes. Stay away.",0
"Travelled Manchester to Bangkok return via Muscat with Oman Air. All 4 flights on time. Great food, pleasant staff, and great inflight entertainment. Would certainly use them again.",1
"To follow up with my previous statement. Thank you for ruining my trip back. I had to spend an extra 350 in travel and lodging expenses. I was standing at my gate with a boarding pass. Not a screenshot, waiting to board my plane. I had another customer tell me the gate had changed. I had my phone in my hand. I didnt get a text, email or update on the app. I had to run to the other gate by the time I got there they told me my flight had left. I ended up getting stranded in downtown Charlotte. I was almost robbed trying to find a place that wasnt 200 a night. While I was at my hotel, I called in, angry, which would understate my feelings at the time. The first rep put me on hold for 45 minutes and laughed at me when I told her about having to make extra arrangements and almost getting robbed. When I spoke to the first manager,  she told me it was my fault and I should have been watching the screens. Then I called back only to have another manager blame me yet again for missing my flight. Im done with this airline and any horror stories any of you hear about the extremely poor customer service and total lack of empathy, believe it. They will not be getting my business again.",0
"Marrakech to New York via Lisbon. Horrible customer service, terrible technology, and just utter incompetence. I have never witnessed such a poorly operated airline before with lazy employees.",0
Austin to Phoenix. My original flight was for Friday around 6 am on December 28th. The customer service swore there were no other flights to get me out on that same day so they got me on a flight for the 29th. Already one day taken away from my trip I was made but was willing to work with it. They have now delayed my flight on the 29th by 5 hours and are hesitant to work with me in getting onto a quicker flight to get me out of here. I have spoken to many people and no one has been helpful. I will never fly this airline again and will stick to Southwest Airlines which is always faithful and I have never had any issues with.,0
"I travelled with Lufthansa twice in less than 2 months. Both times I have never gotten my baggage by the time I reached my destination. They delayed my baggage causing me a lot of inconvenience. The second time I travelled with them I thought I would be giving them another shot, but soon I realized that I made a mistake. Never repeating this mistake. I will never fly with Lufthansa again. I had the worst experience.",0
"Terrible service! They charged me and my brother for our luggage twice even though we had already paid for them on the app. Very slow working and lazy. They had 4 people working in the check in station but only 1 knew what they were doing. One of the girls working was complaining about her lunch instead of helping us. And then on the plane ride, the flight attendants were rude and had no idea what they were doing. They had the snack carts blocking the bathrooms. They kept telling us to sit down but we couldn't because their cart was blocking us to our seats. And then during the flight I overheard them gossiping about some of passengers. Service was terrible, never want to use this airline again.",0
"Shanghai to Abu Dhabi via Rome with Etihad Airways. This was a bad flight. Very uncomfortable, even though I paid for extra leg room. Food was horrible. I contacted their customer service, but they don't seem to care.",0
"Warsaw to Nice and the crew was amazing. Legroom was good and seats were comfortable. During a flight a selection of complimentary beverages was available. I recieved a sweet bun with pudding which was delicious, and before landing a chocolate wafer.",1
"I took my second trip with Delta and I must say I was definitely not disappointed. I flew with Delta last year and felt there was no need to change to a different airline. I flew from Indy to Phoenix via Minneapolis. The crews both at the gate and during the flight were professional and respectful.  The big two thumbs I want to give is on my luggage in Phoenix. No sooner had I walked off the plane and down to the baggage claim carousel was I greeted by my bag arriving. Only thing I found average was the seat comfort, but granted I have never really cared about seat comfort.",1
"Punta Cana to Gatwick via Madrid. When I initially booked with Air Europa, I heard mixed reviews and was worried. Having travelled with them, both outbound and inbound, they are a great company. Some budget airlines could take a leaf from their book. The staff were so polite and helpful. Nothing was too much trouble. We had a long journey both ways and it was the easiest journey I have ever travelled. The luggage transfer was seamless and waiting at the destination with no trouble. Any questions asked to cabin crew were answered with manners and excellent customer service. Thank you Air Europa for making a long haul flight so much more enjoyable.",1
"Had a flight from Denver to Orlando Tuesday November 26, 2019. A snow storm hit canceling our flight. Spirit could not find another flight to get down there when we need to. My daughter had a chance to cheer at Disney world, my other daughter and friend was also going with us a chance of a life time. Spirit was nice enough to refund our whole amount back but when I called Frontier they wanted 119 each for a cancelation fee. Inform me to do online so I did on Wednesday 27th. They won't give us a refund. Even when our flight was delayed coming home because of the weather. I had to work 5 jobs and my daughter 3 just to afford going on this. Why purchase travel insurance if it does not work.",0
Disney weekend. Left Thursday. Supposed to return Sunday am. Flight canceled 3 am Sunday. No reschedule flight. Terrible airline. First and last time on this carrier.,0
"Seattle to Belize via Houston. For a business class ticket, this was a decidedly economy class experience. There was no higher class of fare on this flight. The seats were completely worn out to the point you could feel the metal bars beneath them. The food was not worthy of a school cafeteria it was so bad as to be inedible and unrecognizable. I honestly don't know why anyone would give United the extra money for this experience.",0
"Very bad customer service. When I tried to contact by phone this was answered with an automatic reply and later it was simply dropped. When trying via chat I had to wait almost 5 hours until I was told a contact. However, he could only give me the information I already found on the internet. So I was not helped further. The prices of the tickets are cheap and you can definitely see that in their customer service! Not recommended!  Zeer slechte klantenservice. Toen ik contact probeerde op te nemen via telefoon werd dit beantwoord met een automatisch reply en later werd het gewoon afgelegd. Bij het proberen via de chat moest ik bijna 5 uur wachten totdat ik een contactpersoon te horen kreeg. Die kon me echter enkel de informatie geven die ik al vond op het internet. Ik werd dus niet verder geholpen. De prijzen van de tickets zijn goedkoop en dat zie je zeker terug in hun klantenservice! Geen aanrader!",0
"It's not the first time i travel with Qatar Airways. I recommend it cause they are professionnel, helpful and in touch the application is easy to use. I contacted the customer service and I was quickly helped. At the end it's not the last time and thanks you for your service you deserve the award you have",1
My family and I travelled Doha to Cochin return Business class both ways. Outbound flight to Cochin a youngster from economy was permitted to stow his baggage over my wife's seat came into business class opened the locker dropping a bag on my wife sitting below. This happened in the presence of inflight staff who did not intervene and stop this passenger. On our return journey we boarded before economy passengers had occupied their seats we had many passengers 'brushing' past us in the aisle with bulky hand baggage. The finale to this memorable saga on the return flight we were presented with the standard Menu card. We were seated in the second row from the front of business class and yet we were told that the fish on the menu had already run out. I will not be travelling Jet in the future.,0
LAX to CAN on Dec 16th. Although our trip to Thailand was just a nightmare travel experience. Cancelled flights missed connections miscommunication nonsensical issues. We were not originally scheduled to fly on Southern China out of LAX. We were not even supposed to be in LAX when our trip first started. When all was said and done we were set up to go on China Southern out of LAX. Since I had never heard of this airline I was sceptical. I was very nervous to take a 15 hour flight to a communist country. I had already had a nightmarish travel experience leading up to this point. The last thing I needed was what I thought was going to be a dog eat dog experience. Well this experience was anything but that. We flew on the enormous A380. We had economy class and still got TV screen in front of us and they had the largest selection of movies to watch than any of the other airlines we flew. The flight attendants were great. I wish we had more water to drink on the flight though. The food was pretty good. The seats were wide and spacious. The 15 hour flight was one of the better ones. Landing in Guangzhou was also a great experience. The airport could have been kept a little warmer but we found a corner of the airport to watch the sun come up while we waited for our next flight to Bangkok. It was an easy 2.5 hour flight. When we got to Bangkok I noticed at baggage claim that my wallet was gone. I went into stress overload mode. Then we found out that the China Southern staff had found it on the plane and turned it into their office in the Bangkok airport. This all happened before I even knew the wallet was gone. I went and retrieved the wallet and found that it wasn't tampered with. It was even packaged up to make it so no one could tamper with it. China Southern Airlines saved my trip.,1
Denver to Detroit. Wow am I upset with this airline. Staff at front desk told me to not worry about missing my connecting flight as I had plenty of time. Here I am still sitting on the plane. They told me 20 extra minutes due to snow preparation. 30 minutes later I have not gotten an update. Will be missing my connecting flight during a very emotional time for my family. Never ever again will I fly this airline that could care less about their passengers and where they need to be,0
"On Wednesday we booked tickets to travel to Maputo and back over the weekend as me and my partner needed to be at the South African embassy Friday 14 June. When we checked in for our flight we were told the flight was 2 hours late. After 2 hours we went through the gate to wait to board and to our surprise to hear the flight is delayed by another hour. I will not make it in time for the embassy and will have to pay to change my tickets to a different day. I've never made use of such a poor service and I am deeply disgusted, also won't recommend this airline to anyone. I'll rather pay more and be sure i will be on time from point A to point B.",0
Dubai to Melbourne last month. Flight was terrible. For a start the plane was freezing and when I asked for an extra blanket they told me there were no spare ones despite the plane not being full. My seat would not recline the entertainment selection was very poor and the food was awful. My duty free alcohol was taken off me even though it had been sealed from Dubai. We queued for about 45 minutes to get back on the plane after a 2 hour stop over and then had to wait for another hour once we had boarded the flight!,0
"Seattle to Incheon. Very good to flight. Boarsing time is accurate and fast. The airline representatives help to the elder person take by wheelchair. It is so nice and awesome. Also, the staff are kind.",1
"Due to the epidemic situation, there was no food on the plane, but everyone have a bag of snacks, including water, biscuits, orange juice, chocolate and potato chips.  The service of the stewardesses was very good. After arriving in Guangzhou, get off the plane in order, then take the number to go through the customs and nucleic acid test, finally wait for the luggage, and wait in line for the bus to send to the isolation hotel. The whole process is fast and orderly, and the attitude of the staff is very good.  I was really nervous when I got off the plane. It was my first time to experience these procedures and I'm alone but I didn't feel flustered and scared because of her help.",1
Probably one of the nicest flights I have had. The seat was very comfortable and the flight attendants were delightful. The meals were well presented and tasty. The personal videos had a good selection of recent films but I slept 5 hours. My only complaint was that the cabin was too warm for my liking and I awoke sweating a few times.,1
So glad Frontier Airlines wanted to make sure every single passenger's bags fit the dimensions before boarding. Nothing like delaying a flight for that. If they are that concerned maybe they need a process for while the plane is unloading or force the check in to be in person to do that so the flight wouldn't be late. Staff is very rude off and on the plane. I will not be flying with them again!,0
Flight took off on time and arrived a few minutes ahead of schedule. All Georgian cabin crew were very friendly and helpful. The flight was full but the cabin crew made sure the carry on bags were rearranged in the overhead bins so that the disembarking process is fast and smooth. I sat in the emergency exit and that is always comfortable. Wizz Air continues to be my preferred airline for travel in Europe.,1
"A dysfunctional website and app that doesn't allow ticket change or booking a special meal. It leads to errors all the time. No technical support. No one answering the phone after hours of waiting and dozens of attempts. Therefore no possibilities to change my ticket or do with an agent what I can't do online. No warnings about anything, no one telling you anything. The worst airline I ever flew with.",0
"Allegiant not only canceled one of our flights with no reasoning given. They turned around and put us on a different flight leaving out of Tulsa and by the time we got to Oklahoma canceled that flight as well with no compensation. They told me allegedly they canceled due to weather but since I was already in Tulsa there was no weather. No compensation, no flights in a ruined spring break trip is all I got from Allegiant.",0
"Worst airline ever! We had a 6 hour delay without any warning. Terrible service, worst experience ever! They offered no compensation and no explanation as to why there is a six hour delay",0
"This would have been my first experience flying on Spirit. However, the night before my flight, I was sent to the ER unexpectedly. I expected that I would not be refunded for the outbound flight, but when I called to change the date of the return flight, I was told by a very unfriendly agent that both flights were automatically cancelled. I will never fly with this airline, despite the low fares. I would give this review a ""0"" but it is not allowed. ",0
"Business class, what a joke! Economy seats just leaving the middle seat vacant does not make it business class. The only good thing I can find to say is that it was on time and safe. Food was better left alone.",0
"Chennai to Goa. My mother of 88 years and myself travelled yesterday morning by 6E128. The wheel chair attendant of my mother in IndiGo forgot to bring along her Walking Stick after the Security check. We came to know of this after boarding the aircraft. I complained on arrival in Goa and it is very inconvenient for her without the Walking Stick. We are extremely pleased with the excellent follow up by all concerned staff of IndiGo, and my mother is very happy to receive the Walking Stick today which was room delivered to us. We would like to share and record our sincere appreciation to all concerned staff of IndiGo.",1
Melbourne to London via Bandar seri Begawan and Dubai with Royal Brunei Airlines. A modern Boeing 787 that appeared to be well maintained. I had read that the seats were uncomfortable but did not find them to be so. There is more room than most economy seats. The aircraft is quiet and smooth and larger windows can be darkened rather than having shades so amount of light coming in can be regulated. The cabin crew were the best I have encountered across many airlines. I was a bit nervous as Royal Brunei was the cheapest fare I could find. ,1
"We had to rush and run like crazy just to catch the plane and swear our heart out with my wife being pregnant. When we got to the plane on time, the plane then made an.1 hour and 15 min delay. I would have believed the right thing to do is for them to announce the delay at least on the live board. Ou luggage got damaged and later thrown away as the wheel broke after I believe their intensive drags and smash they done when transporting our luggage in the connecting flight, and one of the luggage was binned as it cannot be used again. I complained and their explanations is worthless because they did not compensate us at least for the damaged luggage. Very disappointing experience. i will not be using them in the future and i advise others not to as well and seek a better airliner for a peace of mind.",0
Johannesburg to Mumbai via Seychelles. Terrible airline to fly with. They will try to scam money out of you any way they can. Staff are extremely rude and unhelpful. Do yourself a favor and pay a little bit more to go with a reputable airline.,0
"Working in healthcare as nurses made it extremely difficult to travel, Sun Country Airlines refused to allow any type of extension on our credit and we lost all of our money. All we did was request an extension to book by one week so we could see how the pandemic was going to stabilize. Their customer service was terrible, took 6 weeks to respond, waited on hold for hours and then it would hang up on us. I will never recommend them for not taking care of their customers.",0
"I was thoroughly pleased with my flight. I really was surprised and had never had such a pleasant experience on an aircraft. Business class was fabulous, great staff, lounge, food, everything was perfect. I have flown to India via other airlines and have always been fairly disappointed. I try and fly business when i do super long haul trips for comfort and to arrive well rested and with less jet lag. Qatar Airways business class is a step above the rest as far as I'm concerned.",1
San Diego to Toronto with a connection in Calgary. There was only about 45 people on the first flight to Calgary and the flight attendants were friendly and hospitable making jokes with passengers. Calgary to Toronto was a little busier however the staff were still excellent.,1
Flight delay is very upsetting. Every time I fly Spirit I am disappointed. Not enough room on your planes for a 6'5 individual. I have had interactions with staff members who have been extremely rude. If at all possible this will be the last time I fly with Spirit.,0
"Newark to Boston. Late all because of lack of personnel. 5 hour delay and counting for a connecting flight to Chicago, all based on a policy of needing 2 attendants on each flight. No back up employees at the airport.",0
Sydney to Nairobi via Dubai. My seat did not recline. No help from staff. My 3rd flight with Emirates in a row where there has been a problem. Standards have fallen below requirement. And good luck getting a response from their team afterwards.,0
"Flew SAS Scandinavian from London Heathrow to Oslo. On arrival to the boarding gate we were greeted by a very rude check in flight attendant who refused to allow us to bring our cabin luggage on board as the flight was full. However, when we boarded several of the overhead compartments were empty. We explained to the check in staff and flight attendants that we had an express train to catch in Oslo and we did not have the time to wait for our baggage and go through customs. The staff did not try to resolve the situation and ignored us and told us to email SAS with our problem and that we are just one of the ""unlucky ones."" The customer service was terrible and they had no interest in doing anything to assist us and hoped if they ignored us we would stop pressing them on the issue.",0
"These days I dread flying British Airways either long haul or short haul. This flight in business class from London Heathrow to Nice was a pleasant surprise, the galleries lounge at T5 is usually rammed and dirty but as our flight was 8 am it wasn't too bad although as usual the food offerings very poor compared to other airlines. Boarding a mess, surely if you have paid to fly business class you should be able to board before gold, silver members who then wander down to economy. Great FAs, nice hot or cold breakfast choice and 2 drinks offerings on the 1hr 30 min flight, luggage off promptly. Return again good, stacked over Kent for 15 mins, luggage took 30 minutes to get to belt, priority bags all over the place. Would use again for a short hop but try and avoid business long haul.",1
LH411 from JFK to Munich 23 August 2014. I sat in Business class together with my family. The comfort was satisfactory for the space the seats and the service. Staff was very friendly and professional food and drinks were of good quality. Overall I appreciated the service and quality of this airline. I am frequent traveler and I always prefer to travel with Lufthansa both in economy and business so I recommend it to everyone.,1
"Flew Air Transat from Montreal to Punta Cana. I have taken many trips in my life, and this one has got to be the worst one! Terrible from the moment my husband and I booked in September until our return, the customer service was very poor. The agents gave the wrong information, I had to call over 5 times and each agent gave me a different answer. This put a sour taste for our honeymoon. Once on the flight I was even more disappointed. No service, no drinks, no snacks. On our way back, a rude woman in front of me pushed her chair all the way back on me to the point of actually hurting my knees. I asked her politely to move her seat up and she refused. I called the flight attendant and instead of acknowledging my feelings, she tells me to move seats. I did not want to be separated from my husband it was our honeymoon! The flight attendant calls her superior, who was very rude and sarcastic. She told me the same thing as the other stewardess, ""switch seats, don't have your table down, you have to cooperate"". I did not feel like arguing.",0
Rip off and scam. Be aware. Warning. This company is a rip off like some others once your bags are overweight. I paid 60 Euro for 7 kg overweight. Today with people anyway not flying because of fear this shows how this company works and how they treat their customers in today's environment. I just can hope that airbaltic will suffer with this policy. A nice move would be a warning and wish a good flight.,0
"Melbourne to Amritsar via Singapore booked for January 2018. Worst airline ever! If there were negative points I could give them, I would. Appalling customer service, incompetent staff on ground and in the cabin. They lost my luggage to being with and ruined the first week of my holiday. Despite booking Scootbiz and having flexibility in my ticket, when I enquired to change my flight to leave early, they quoted me USD 550 to change my ticket. This is after I paid USD 799 for my ticket. When I go to book a fresh ticket with the same extras etc, the new ticket is USD 794. How does this work! How are they even allowed to operate in the Australian market?",0
"Cathay has a very good design on its seats on A350, it has enough space to put my things and the TV screen is huge. The food on board is fine, the service of the flight attendants is great. In conclusion, I love to fly with Cathay!",1
June 17th. Casablanca to Dakar Senegal. Our second flight with RAM in a fortnight and again we were not disappointed. Flight left on time aircraft was new the meal was very nice and the flight crew pleasant. We chose RAM because it was a direct flight and the price was reasonable.,1
Returning from Las Vegas on Jan 6 2014. Got to the Las Vegas airport and was told the flight was delayed by 4 hours due to pilot being timed out. Does Allegiant never have any stand by staff? By the looks of the gate that day all Allegiant flights were very delayed. The weather was fine so very little in the way of excuses for them. I doubt I will ever fly Allegiant again as this is the 3rd time with problems.,0
"My Orlando to Trenton flight with Frontier Airlines got canceled and I received no type of notification besides an email. Luckily I check my email every morning or else I would have went to the airport in preparation for my flight. For an issue this drastic, such as a flight cancelation, I should receive a text or a call notifying that I need to get a new flight. I called the morning of and was on hold for almost 2 hours waiting to talk to an agent about what I should do about my flight cancelation. Horrible customer service.",0
"Rubbish transfer in Miami. Both ways. Huge lines, absolute no prioritisation over people who are late. No one around to talk to. No directions. Staff has no clue what is going on. We were late for connecting fight and they dont compensate for hotel as its immigration fault, not theirs.",0
"Flew American Airlines from Tulsa to Baltimore. Late flights and terrible baggage handling, avoid this airline at all costs. Baggage gets left at origin and I am not informed until I reach my destination. I have none of my essentials before a big interview and this airline was in no hurry to deliver my luggage to me even after it arrived at baggage claim the next day.",0
"Return flight was delayed twice then cancelled, next possible flight out was 2 days later. Spirit did nothing to try and help get another flight booked, did not offer any accommodations as far as hotel, food etc. There were a large number of us flying and they said they couldn't get all of us on a return flight and that we were basically on our own. They were more eager to refund our money than get us on a different flight. If we were able to find a different flight and it was cheaper than what we originally paid they were not going to refund the difference. The discounted price of their tickets is not worth the hassles that you may go through because of the airline. I will never fly Spirit again.",0
"I understood that Frontier was a low cost airline and that many ""extras"" had additional fees associated with them. What I didn't realize was that if you paid the fees, they would not provide the service you paid for. I chose to pay the extra fees for seat selection so that my party could sit together and my children would not have to sit next to a stranger. I booked 8 seats and chose the seats from Frontier's seat selection menu. When we arrived at the airport, the seats had been changed and we were no longer seated as a group. The agent told me there was nothing they could do about it since our seats had already been assigned to someone else. So, we were split up on our flight. I was told that not only could we not sit together, they had no power to refund the seat selection fees that had already been paid. I would have to call and talk with ""Customer Relations."" I have now made 3 phone calls to customer relations and spent a total of 2.5 hours on the phone. Again I am told that ""customer relations is working on it"". I waited and again, no call back. ",0
"Abu Dhabi to Kannur. I Booked a business class ticket and worst terrible service.  No Special Q for business class passengers. Up on my request only they put a "" Priority tag"" on my bag. They will change your seat as per their wish. They put Aisle Seat instead of my selected seat and when I notified, they changed. No priority boarding to flight. You may board on last just like entire economy passengers. Poor sandwiches and so called some poor quality dishes they serve. Baggage we received on destination last. Due to economy charges, may be you can opt this airline if charge is considerably lower. Otherwise don't opt for such a poor service.",0
"Lufthansa was kind of special for me on my trip from Vienna to Milan via Munich. I have never had to catch a connection flight and even though I was a bit worried, I knew it would be okay and it was. The cabin staff were helpful and kind, and I can't complain about anything. This was the first time me flying with Lufthansa, but I hope, not the last one!",1
"The worst travel experience for me ever. My whole family went to the airport with our boarding pass just to find out that our flight was canceled. The reason is simply because they don't have enough passenger on the plane and they will lose money if they fly. But what about my booked hotel, rental car, tours at the destination? We lost thousands of dollars, our precious vacation time and the time spent on researching the trip. Our vacation turned out to be just staying at home and being disappointed. When asked if it is possible for us to be on other flights to get to our destination, the answer is of course no, because they don't work with any other airlines. Needless to say I will never use Allegiant Air and this review is to help you to avoid such terrible airline so that you can enjoy your vacation.",0
"Booked Jetstar 3 times and flight cancelled 2 times! My flight was first being rescheduled to the later time of 4am. After checking, the flight was cancelled and I was only informed via SMS just 3 hours before departure. I was already on the way to airport and it was midnight. No more Jetstar.",0
Flight CDG to BKK AF 166 in 777300ER with 10 abreast seating. Very cramped crew were stressed and managed on a 10 hr flight between meals to come by one time only with water. Very uncomfortable bad connections of headphones and no excuse for delay. Not even 'we hope to welcome you on board of one of our flights again'. Well that explains all sad experience.,0
"Bombay to Goa in Business Class in an A320. Vistara currently provides the finest premium experience in India. The entire experience was flawless. Comfortable seats, warm service. There is no WiFi on this route but given the short flight time it is not an issue.",1
I flew from Manchester England to Sydney Australia via Singapore. And having flown from Sydney to Manchester and Manchester to Sydney many times only ever using Emirates and Qantas I found a cheap deal with Singapore airlines and thought I'd give them ago. Now being from England Emirates are one of the most advertised and so I thought was the best airline. How I have been very wrong. In economy the seat sizes seem pretty much the same but with Singapore I found the seat cushions were a lot softer. The major difference I found with Singapore was the service. They were always smiling and welcoming. And this being a night flight they didn't sit down for four hours for next meal time they circled with drinks and snacks in between more than once!,1
Beirut to Amsterdam via Warsaw. The plane from Beirut to Warsaw got delayed a little. So I missed my connecting flight from Warsaw to Amsterdam. Now I am sitting in Warsaw airport waiting for another five hours for another flight to take me to Amsterdam. Oh and they gave me a voucher for a free meal.,0
"Dussseldorf to Kaunas via Warsaw. Hoping to fly to Kaunas, but after spend some time at the Dusseldorf International airport the destination changed to ""Annulliert"". There is no LOT crew or service desk at the airport so you can only try to contact them by phone. After several attempts of more then 30 minutes hold the line music I went home. Don't expect any service at this airline.",0
"Sydney to Ballina. Plane booked 2 months ago, and yesterday we were told that the flight will be canceled. 2 hours on the phone just to be told, we have no solution, we give you the money back and that's it. We had to leave Sydney to go to Byron bay, no solution other than to get there by bus, or by driving. The company are very incorrect and  not professional at all, Never want to be with this company again.",0
"With 130 euros for two, just hand luggage, this flight was a real bargain. I liked the fact that Brussels Airlines sticks to group boarding.  Also disembarking is row by row and crew sees upon it. Adequate seating, snacks at reasonable prices, announcements in Dutch, French and English, and an on time performance, even with a delayed departure on the inbound flight. Didn't like the endless walk to and from the gate at Brussels Airport though. But all in all very good.",1
"I am a frequent flyer and normally find service on a flight average. But, this time to my surprise the service on this flight was excellent. The crew was ensuring each ones comfort and the feeling having a ""Truly Happy to serve"" vibes were there. It was more than just a duty. It was genuine. Experienced excellent customer service after a long time.",1
PKG to PVG. Cabin crews are all attentive always smiling. Food is good smooth flight and Dragonair always my first choice for my Shanghai Trip.,1
Flight from Tokyo to Yangon in business class. Seats were the egg shell design fairly comfortable. There were only five passengers in business so we received the absolute best service ever! Food was good but not great. These flight attendants actually smiled and laughed. Now if every flight was like this one.,1
Cleveland to Newark. United Airlines does not update their customers. Does not follow through on the expectations that they set. Their employees put blame on other employees at corporate or other locations. I fly United 6 times a month and they are delayed 5 out of the 6 times. If there was another airline I would use it 1st,0
My daughter and I attempted to check in at Johannesburg's OR Tambo airport for our flight to Victoria Falls Zimbabwe. Although we were timely and had paid nearly 8000 rand each for our tickets we were not allowed to check in. We were told that the airline had overbooked the flight. Told that although another group had not yet checked in we were not going to be issued boarding passes unless someone failed to appear. My daughter was able to get on the flight but I had to remain behind and spend the night at the airport Holiday Inn. The airline paid for the hotel and my meals but I asked for a rental car instead of a hotel so I could drive to Vic Falls and only miss half a day of riding. I was refused. The airline gave me a free domestic flight anywhere SAA flies in Africa to be used in the next year. I live in the US and have little or no chance of getting back to Africa in the next year. When I got on the plane I saw at least ten empty seats in business class. I missed a full day and a half of my six day riding tour. My daughter and I were split up during our vacation and left to travel separately. South African Airlines personnel were polite but just passed me around like they were completely helpless.,0
"Ft Walton to Dallas Ft Worth. American Airlines is by far one of the worst airlines I have flown with. I have been traveling a lot for work lately and have been on over 4 flights in the past week with them. Each flight has been delayed, their employees do nothing to inform their guest of the delay or what is going on. American Airlines used to be very organized and customer friendly, however, after my past few experience I will never book a flight through them again.",0
"Flew Helsinki to Malaga. Its always a pity to see that certain companies aren't family friendly. Our flight to Spain had a few empty seats and the company didn't bother to allocate families with babies in those rows. There even was one passenger using three seats on his own. Also to point out that if a baby is sleeping the flight attendants don't need use loud voices to ask you if you'd like coffee. Last but not least, this is the second time that Norwegian manages to lose our baby pushchair in a direct flight. The most disgraceful part is that they always smile at you and say, it will come tomorrow but never does.",0
"Another wonderful experience with Qatar Airways, upgraded to First Class from Melbourne to Doha on the A380. Very attentive flight attendants, with delicious food and wine served. The bathroom is a whole other level of luxury with plenty of space and hidden drawers for the amenities. The cabin itself is small and very private, and extremely comfortable. Business class Doha to Helsinki on the smaller A321, once again very attentive service by the flight attendants on this sector and Athens to Doha and Doha to Melbourne. Seats ok on the A321, could be improved. Flew business class on the A330 from Athens which was comfortable, and the marvellous A380 Doha to Melbourne. Loved the Business class service on this flight, it was faultless, the flight attendant looking after our section was superb and was very attentive. Will definitely fly Qatar Airways again.",1
Singapore to Kuala Lumpur. I am flying on 23rd jan the price was overly high for such an airline. Staff at the airport payment counter Weigh my bag and tell me it will cost me 65 Singapore dollar if I want to take my bag as I was 2 Kg extra.  He was holding on to my bag as if I would run away and not pay for it.  This flight was suppose to be my flight back home for the holiday season and now my mood were all spoilt thanks to these kind of staff.. you should really look into your price of your ticket if you still wish to charge anyone the extra 65bucks.. for a 300 Singapore dollars flight on a Budget airline without any service and charging 65 bucks on random bag check.. seriously?,0
"Chengdu to Los Angeles. It's a very pleasant trip to fly with them. The cabin was well maintained and well cleaned. Both dinner and breakfast were delicious. The crew was nice and ready to provide any assistance. One passenger lost his passport, the crew made a lot of efforts to find it for him, which was very lovely.",1
"I had read some of the reviews, so was a little concerned, but loved the price. There was no charge for our luggage! We got lunch, with a complimentary glass of wine at no extra cost. We also got a snack shortly before descending into Vancouver. The entertainment was in the seatback in front of me. Movies, TV shows, etc, again, no extra cost.",1
8 hr delay on flight take off. Land in Melbourne 3.5 hr wait for baggage. Need I say more. I have a nap sack I put under the seat and a carry on bag. AirAsia would not let me take my small bag on. So it got checked. And now the delays. And also last flight broken luggage. Avoid this airline.,0
First time to book a flight with allegiant. Will be the last. Booked a flight months ago to go on vacation to Florida. Wake up for my 8am flight to be cancelled the day of. Next flight for them is next Saturday! Never again!,0
London to Muscat. Everything about this flight experience was just so right. A very pleasant business class lounge at Heathrow to delicious food and sparkling service on board the plane. Oman are really up there with the best.,1
Flew Norwegian JFK to Gatwick in July. Plane was delayed for 40 minutes and was very nervous as it was the 3rd week they started flying from JFK to Gatwick. After one gate changed plane left 40 minutes later. Dreamliner experience was a very good plane is nice touch screen ordering was easy and efficient. Would recommend and we paid half we would if travel by the regular big airlines.,1
"This review is specifically about Maddie, crew member who took care of us. She was attentive, warm, friendly and nothing was too much trouble. Smiling from start to finish. She should be the brand ambassador for BA.",1
"London to Amsterdam return. Original outbound flight cancelled due to staff shortages. To make matters worse, my rebooked flight was also cancelled, as was the one afterwards. One angry phone call later, I discovered my rebooked flights had not been cancelled, rather KLM had not entered by booking in to the flight correctly. I was eventually rebooked on to a convenient alternative KLM flight, but lo and behold, on the day I was due to fly, my flight was cancelled. After another angry phone call, I took an pleasant and uneventful BA flight to Amsterdam. Sure enough, my return flight on KLM was cancelled due to technical issues with the plane and my rebooked flight delayed by an hour. To their credit, KLM air crew were very nice and their planes clean. However, the chaos in which KLM seem to operate has put me off flying with them in the future.",0
"Another great flight with Air Transat! I prefer this airline than any of the other charter airlines out of Toronto Pearson. Flew club class. Service excellent start to finish, friendly staff. Nice meal and snacks. Amenity kits, comfortable big seats, big screens. Content is a bit dated but something to entertain. Flight left on time, arrived early. Onboarding quick. Exiting the plane was quick and efficient. Bags arrived and were off the plane fast. Air Transat has never let me down.",1
"Nanchang to Zhuhai. The flight delayed for half an hour. Flight attendants were friendly and helpful. The seat near the emergency exit has more space, I felt comfortable during the flight. When we arrived, Zhuhai airport was a little small, but I could walk out the airport very quickly. Overall this was an enjoyable experience.",1
"Thank you KLM! I am an cardholder with KLM and I thank goodness I am! Schiphol was exceptionally busy due to holiday flights and staff shortage. Waiting times of 1 hour for bag check. I would have missed my flight if it wasn't for my frequent flyer status. KLM helped me get through the queues. I arrived well on time at the gate. The flight left 10 minutes late, but arrived 10 minutes ahead of schedule! Staff we gentle, welcoming. The embraer is a very comfortable plane, I prefer it over the B737 seating.",1
"The service I received from a phone operator for Air Canada was phenomonal. His name was Aaron and he was so compassionate as I dealing with a step Dad and Poppy to my kids getting ready to pass away. I very much need to be there for my Mom and he understood that and helped make changing my flights so much easier. Thank you Aaron, you are my angel today and the stress that has been lifted off of me feels so good. I will pay it forward for sure.",1
Flight DL241 from Rome to Atlanta. Great flight and service from stewards. We even couldn't fill the 11 hour flight. Great attitude and always busy.,1
Egyptair is a subpar airline. They lost my luggage 30 days ago and since then it's impossible to get a hold of them. Their number in Toronto does not seem to work and they never answer their email. I was warned that it was a bad airline but this is on another level. The worst airline I have taken so far. Avoid at all cost.,0
"Ho Chi Minh to Phu Quoc. Worst experience ever. Never use this airline even if you are in hurry. It's been delayed without notice, randomly selecting passengers to weigh their cabin luggages but they don't even allow 0.5kg. Had to pay 550,000 Don for 0.5kg. While other people are taking a cabin luggage as well as a handbag, I wasn't allowed to do so without appropriate answer. They just wanted money from me. Never use this airline.",0
"We had tickets booked in advance to fly from Seattle to Vegas for anniversary celebration on Friday February 11th. The airline called us in our way to the airport and told us that the flight got canceled. I lost time from work, meaning wasted leave time, had my children with babysitter that I had to pay in advance, I lost money because we had Vegas shows and entertainment tickets bought as final deals on Groupon. Wasted money on Uber to get to the airport. The airline couldn't book another flight within 2 days. Just ruined our anniversary weekend and put my family in the impossible situation of not even being able to book a ticket with other airline, there were no last minutes tickets available for that day. It was the worst feeling ever, biggest disappointment by far. All we got is a 2 hour notice before flight.",0
"Copenhagen to Singapore. Best airline to travel especially for long haul flights. Good entertainment, good hospitality, nice selection of food, drinks and snacks. The Crew were very polite and full of smiles. I will definitely fly with Singapore Airlines again!",1
Worst customer service. I have been trying for over a year to get a refund for a flight from July 2020. Due to COVID travel restrictions our trip to Ireland was cancelled. I have been trying since May of 2020 to reach someone about getting a refund as our flight to the UK was cancelled and our lodging in Ireland was cancelled. This airline did not answer any emails etc.. for over a year and now has refused to refund the cost of the flight.,0
"Two hours before my flight was to leave Chicago I checked with Porter and was pleased to see everything was ""on time"". Upon arriving I was told that their Service Provider was down and the flight would be delayed a half hour to an hour. 3 hours later we boarded. As a result I arrived late and missed an important event. Porter did apologize and further claimed it was not their fault. As if that is supposed to erase the draining experience of sitting in an airport terminal for 3 hours longer than necessary. I don't know about you but if Porter really wants to instil customer confidence and loyalty they've got to do better than a superficial sounding apology.",0
"The Customer Service Representative at Gate 25 whose name was Michelle was extremely helpful when we just barely arrived at the Gate in time for Boarding. She was quick, efficient, and personable and she got us aboard in time. I was duly impressed by her performance.",1
Just returned from Vancouver to London on a direct flight in club class. We were surprised and pleased with the level of service and the constant supply of food and drink the food was very good. The stewardess was very pleasant and professional. The airfares are much lower than other airlines. Those who complain about minor issues your not in a 5 star hotel for a week remember it's a cheap flight you've booked for a few hours travel. Pay a much higher price with a premium airline next time and then make a comparison. We will book again with Air Transat for our next trip to Canada.,1
I had a flight on October 14 going from ATH to HER and back upgrading my economy ticket to business by spending some miles on the aegean miles program. I had an excellent light meal the personnel of the aircraft was gentle and smiley. The seat was the same like the economy class but it was comfortable enough.,1
"These guys are one of the worst airlines available right now. My flight was supposed to leave at 20.30 on a Sunday and at 12.30 I received a text letting me know that it was cancelled, if I wanted to rebook or refund go to the website and that my rights had been emailed to me. My rights were not emailed to me and upon going on the website to manage my booking, it did not reflect that the flight had been cancelled. It was still asking me to check in even though I already had that morning. They also didn't notify the travel agent. The airport website was also not updated until a few hours after the flight was supposed to depart. To top it off I couldn't get through to them on the phone. A really bad look is that the flight was still available to buy tickets for online which at that point is basically a scam. I also checked the same flight number for the few days after that and exactly the same. This airline know that these flights aren't going ahead and have no intention of fulfilling their contract with their customers yet they still take booking and continue to not provide support. 3 days later and I still haven't had any information. I had to then book a last minute BA flight.",0
"Colombo to Dubai. An amazing crew on UL225 on 8Feb, for me they made the flight one of the best I've flown for the last couple of years.",1
"I have had 2 excellent flights on United Airlines between Cleveland and Edinburgh via Newark. The food and beverages were excellent and served by pleasant attendants. When I expressed my surprise at the number of drinks and snacks served, I was told that United Airlines had just increased this service one month ago. The premium economy seats had plenty of legroom. The seats were wide enough for me but not as wide as on Lufthansa or Swiss. ",1
"My husband and I flew to St Lucia from London Gatwick on 5th May 2016. This was the first time I've flown with British Airways and it will also be the last. Are British Airways training their staff to be as rude and obnoxious as possible? This is certainly how it seems with the awful cabin service we experienced. Our food was literally thrown at us with not a hint of a smile. The gentleman sitting next to me asked the stewardess very politely if he could have a drink, to which she replied ""if you want another drink you'll have to go up to the back of the aircraft and get it yourself as I have far too much to do to be running back and forward with drinks for you"". Strange as I thought they were there to help passengers. We thought we were just unlucky with this journey but sadly not, as the return journey was pretty much the same. Miserable, unhelpful and downright rude cabin crew. Very disappointed as I thought British Airways would have a bit more class than this.",0
"The worst traveling experience I have ever had. Flights delayed to the point of missing connecting ones, unprofessional service, etc. Our first flight was delayed due to unknown circumstances, which in turn led us to rush in order to make our connecting flight which was in 20 minutes after we had landed. We rush to get our luggage, which also took forever to come out and then our connecting flight gets delayed an hour. Then it gets delayed another hour. I am sitting in the airport waiting for my next flight as I type. This entire experience has been a nightmare. Do not waste your money on American Airlines.",0
Flew on Boeing 767 from SG to Haneda. Overall very good airline the only downside was that there was very limited entertainment on board flights for people who don't speak Japanese.,1
"I flew Ryanair from Stanstad to Athens return, and was aware of the aspects of luggage weight and hand luggage, printing boarding pass etc, and all went smoothly. Ryanair is a budget airline at a good cost so am well pleased. Read the terms and conditions and all should go well.",1
The flight was delayed for 24 hours and no prior information was passed to the passengers. All the passengers arrived at the airport checked in and had to wait for 6 hours before some came along with police to inform that the flight has some technical fault and they don't know when it will be fixed. Ultimately had to wait for 24 hours. No arrangements for food or water was made.,0
Staff were unfriendly and rude. Delayed leaving Dulles and delayed returning to Dulles. I am going to avoid flying United if at all possible.,0
"Flight delayed from Denver to Helena 2 times! From the time I left to go to the airport in Colorado Springs and fly with United to Helena I could have driven in almost the same amount of time. When I politely ask the employee at the gate desk when the flight to Helena left, he was very short and rude.",0
"My husband and I were seated towards the back of the plane. Row 25 to be exact. It was a full flight. No issues there. However, during take off one of the other passengers managed to leave an open alcoholic beverage in the overhead carry on area. This alcoholic beverage found its way 2 seats back to pour onto my husband and I. I do mean poured on us!! Overhead luggage was soaked in what smelled to be whiskey and so were our clothes. Let me also add that my husband is 11 days out of Alcohol rehab! So needless to say this caused even more issues to the 3 screaming babies on board and the 4 very intoxicated passengers surrounding us. Those are things we could have handled and expected, but to be doused by alcohol during take off and to return home with our luggage soaked in it was infuriating. To add insult to injury, when we brought it to the flight attendants attention, she was attentive to drying out the over head bins with paper towels but never offered to hand us something to dry off with. I am beyond infuriated with our experience with this airline!",0
"I am shocked to say the least at how unprofessional and disorganized this airline is. I flew out of the Pensacola airport and there were only 2 United employees working on staff to help around 50 customers. I had to beg to get a sentence out of the two employees working and eventually missed my opportunity for accommodations due to a delayed flight and had to rebook with a new airline just to get home. I can not blame the employees that were working due to short staff, but the corporation that allows their employee such a large task flow with no help. Absolutely unacceptable.",0
"Seattle to Austin. I booked a first class ticket as you can see. A completely different first class seat is broken but for some reason they took my seat away, put me in the back of the plane and gave this person my first class seat.",0
FR2447M 29th May. Returned last night from Malaga check in fine but once on board was informed that they had no water and no soft drinks I was offered a vodka or gin but no mixer. I would have thought from a health issue they should at least have restocked with water.,0
"TAP Portugal standards have dropped terribly in the past few years. This was a 3.25 hour flight at supper time and the business class meal was appalling. Snack size portions of cold food and stale bread roll. Flight was delayed leaving Munich by over an hour and the flight crew said nothing, and not one apology was offered at any time. Portuguese efficiency was then backed up by this delayed flight using a very distant bussing gate on arrival into Lisbon that added another 30 mins to the delay. I find the Portuguese people to be hospitable, but their cabin crew are the exact opposite. The snack tray is passed out very quickly and retrieved 15 mins later, and they then disappeared into the front galley for the duration of the flight. They have no seat power supply, no cabin wifi and no cabin service. I know that Star Alliance airlines can be inconsistent, but TAP is nothing short of a disgrace.",0
"Disgusting service. You pay what you get for. Cancelled flights for international flights home with no notification or compensation. We were on hold for an hour and a half on our holiday and also on chat with no resolution outside of a refund which will not alleviate the issue as I still need to get home! We had to book another connecting flight and accommodation, and lost a day off of our holiday in addition to lost money with our existing accommodation. The customer service was pathetic with no complaints department or management to speak to. Completely apathetic response and no care whatsoever. Really unhappy and will never fly with this airline again. Despite paying for your meals you will get a burnt and crusty tiny meal for a 12 hour leg. Despite pre ordering meals you won't get what you ordered for. No complimentary meals or even snacks despite long haul flights. Worn and dirty airplanes with broken seat belts and arm rests. Pay extra and go with a reputable airline that will treat you like a human being and won't ruin the end of start of your vacation.",0
Charleston to Tulsa via Denver. After reading the reviews of this airline and going through their website I was scared this was going to be one of those companies that squeezes money out of you for everything. But actually everything was great. Really nice employees. A good pilot. Excellent service. I had an issue with my baggage and they immediately figured out a solution. The next cheapest airline was double their price. A great value.,1
"Me and my family had a very bad experience with Interjet. We were going to fly to Mexico but the airline did not let us. They changed our flight and later they also said they were not flying anymore and gave us a voucher to fly in the future. Up until today we have not being able to fly and have been like this for almost a year. The worst part is that once the voucher expires, we will lose our money, Interjet will not be responsible for giving us an extension and they will keep our money.",0
"Doncaster to Menorca. I'm a very scared flyer and the pilots were amazing. They explained the route and weather conditions, and why and when the Aircraft would be turning to approach for landing. I'm really worried about the different noises in the plane and the reassurance from the pilots really made a difference. Very impressed. Thank you.",1
"We were in flight delayed, forced to circle terminal for more than 20 minutes, which put us arriving close to our next departure. Then they changed our terminal to the furthest terminal to have to run and catch our plane to Costa Rica. Never mind the people who didn't listen to the announcement of please sit if you do not have a connecting flight in less than an hour. Now we are out 8 hours of our destination and 200 dollars to have to taxi from another town we are flying into. I will not book flight with Delta again. Especially since they did everything they could to delay our landing.",0
I never have a bad word to say.  However for the first time in my life i am going to write a negative review on United Airlines. Firstly I accept responsibility in booking economy ticket and not understanding that I could not take a carry on bag. I was relocating to Florida so i had all my belongings with me. I found out i could not have a carry on and then found out the cost of my carry on would be classed as an excess bag so i would be charged 150 dollars for the smallest bag that i could have put under the seat of my chair on the plane. The supervisor wouldn't help me i asked could i upgrade my ticket so i would be aloud a carry on. One kind lady said she could help me because everyone could tell how ridiculous it was to pay 150 for a tiny carry on. In the end i almost missed my flight while was waiting for the one agent to refund the 150 dollars. I was in tears at this point and none of the agents cared that i was about to miss my flight. Eventually made the flight Took the bag on the plane as a carry on and checked my bank today to find they took the 150 dollars. They put me thru misery and were so rude to me and then i thought well at least they done a nice thing and refunded me the 150 dollars and then i check today and they had put the charge thru afterwards.,0
"For a low budget airline, Icelandair provides exceptional service. During a recent trip to Europe, my flight out of Toronto was late to take off and I ended up missing my connecting flight to Frankfurt from Keflavik. However, Icelandair was able to make my experience very positive by providing a clear explanation for the delay, being apologetic for the inconvenience and providing detailed information on what to do during a 24 hours layover in Iceland. Icelandair paid for a hotel room, transportation and 3 meals during my unexpected stay in Iceland. At the Icelandair Hotel in Keflavik, the front desk agent even looked up bus schedules for me. The customer service at Icelandair went above my expectations and I would recommend it to a friend.",1
"EVA Air Elite class experience was quite good, seats were comfortable, polite and experience cabin crew, and delecious food. Haagen Dazs ice cream was even served during dinner.! Our flight arrived 20 minutes late, but we were very well imformed by the captain. Would reccomend EVA Air Elite class, it is only a couple hundred dollars more than economy, and worth it.",1
"Bangkok to Helsinki. Finnair is a very good airline, at least in Business Class. I am surprised to see Finnair so low in the ranking after KLM for instance. The airplane was a new A350, service onboard was excellent and food was among the best I have had on an airplane. Overall an excellent experience.",1
"Montevideo to Milan via Madrid. I remember having a bad opinion of the airline from previous experiences and during this trip I was reminded why. The airplane is awfully old and unequipped. The entertainment system consisted of large monitors positioned in the middle of the plane with no personal screen, as did other planes until 15 years ago. I was served one glass of water during the flight.",0
"Kochi to Khartoum via Dubai. The airlines charged us for the meal for myself and my family and didn't deliver in the aircraft. They didn't respond the complaint for 2 months even after several follow up, seems they don't care at all, lately we received the voucher for the amount under the travellers name after 3 months of complain and follow up for the discount on next travel within six month validity for each inviduals who didnt get their meal. The voucher could be only used for ticketing in 6 months. I was disappointed about their service, they just dont know what they doing in the name of budjet air.",0
"Porto to Frankfurt. The overall quality of this medium haul flight was good. Lufthansa as always presents excellent crews. The cabin was clean and legroom was more than expected for such a short flight. The food was a simple pastry snack, but very tasty and fresh.",1
"Dublin to Berlin. Without doubt the worst airline I have ever flown with. Firstly my first flight was cancelled and this was very poorly communicated and I then had to fly from a different country. This should have started the alarm bells ringing of what lay in store. The seats were cramped, the flight attendants were clueless and the pilot must have been under supervision.  The food was terrible,  no ice for drinks. No room for overhead bags even though you pay extra for it.",0
"Bordeaux to Madrid. This company charges for luggage which it did not deliver and refuses not just any compensation, but also, at the very least, to refund the cost of the undelivered luggage. In my case, I had to go myself, on my way back, inside the lost luggage section of the airport airport to retrieve my lost luggage.",0
"If you book with them and they cancel your flight, you will not be able to contact them to get your money back or get your flight changed.. I have been struggling for 2 months to get my flight changed ... they don't answer their phone and they don't respond to emails. I cannot give anything more than 1 star for everything because their service is non existent.",0
"Frontier Airlines was the smoothest flight I've been on. From the checkin at the kiosk, the flight and baggage claim. Everything was on time. I didn't have to wait more than five minutes for my bags. The flight was great, the price is unbeatable. To top it all off we flew right over the city skyline and turned right over lake Michigan, it was beautiful. Definitely flying Frontier again. The only down part was leg room, but there's even an option to upgrade of you want!",1
"Warning! With the experience I had recently, stay away from KLM airline, they were nightmare, having sleepless night over my loss baggage since Juliy 22. They still not contact me yet to let me know what happened to my missing baggage. They are the worst airline that I have experienced.",0
I will never fly United again. My flight was delayed 5 hours and I received no notification so I arrived an hour and a half earlier than my original flight. I needed to get to my destination by a certain time for a very important and critical doctors appointment. They rebooked me to a flight that wasn't leaving for another 6 hours and the lady at the gate was so incredibly rude when I approached with questions. I have severe anxiety and was in tears and she complained to the baggage people on the phone aboute while I was standing in front of her. Worst flight service I've ever received.,0
"They are the only airline to offer nonstop flights to countries south of the US. They have changed their regulations where if you purchase a seat reservation or any additional service they are subject to change and no refund. They change flight schedules with no accommodating alternative. You can purchase a flight for 4 am and they will cancel and reissue a ticket for a flight at 6pm leaving you arriving at your destination past midnight.  I purchased my flight and seats well before the time of my travel they issued me a new ticket as part of their schedule change but also gave the seats I purchased to different people putting my issued seat to the rear of the aircraft I called complained they said its all subject to change and availability but those seats should not have been ""available"" if they were purchased.",0
"Singapore to Ho Chi Minh City. Flight is delayed 2 hours without letting passengers know. Condescending ground staff. General bad vibe as expected from this joke of an airline. This is entirely my fault, I was tempted by the cheap price and totally forgot how I was treated like an animal on the previous flight with VietJet. Will not make the same mistake again.",0
Compliments for the very kind helpful staff at Maui Airport when 2 senior citizens had so much trouble accessing our PCR and Arrive can information on our phones . Andi and Kebbekah went above and beyond to help us. I really want to make sure they get praise for their helpful patience to a very stressed out passenger. Kudos to the Staff,1
Finnair flight Helsinki to Stockholm was approximately 1 hour delayed because of late incoming Finnair flight with transfer passengers. I happened to overhear complaints about this from a passenger in the row in front of me. The situation was handled professionally by flight attendants and the purser. Have been flying Finnair since 1972 and again convinced that it is a good choice!,1
Bangalore to Kolkata arrived 49 mins late. They don't care for customer its always late. I had miss my 2 connecting flight while travelling with this airline. Please don't travel with Spicejet If you want to save your time and energy.,0
"Seattle to Beijing. The aircraft is well furnished and equipped with great service entertainment and a large number of movies to choose from. The crew is very helpful and responsive. They fulfilled my ask for additional sheet, drinks, and earphones. Flight took off on time and arrived earlier than expected.",1
"Hong Kong to London. Excellent flight with friendly professional cabin crew . In flight entertainment system was large selection of Movies and entertainment, large selection of duty free and do accept verity Of method check or credit card. Service sequence was well organized. I would recommend Cathay Pacific.",1
"Terrible experience flying with Allegiant Air from start to finish. You may think you're getting a deal but after the fees and taxes it is about the same. Nothing is included in the cost of the flight either. The seats are terrible and the staff was not professional. Flying out of Clearwater was a total cluster and the flight was delayed because they were short staffed. After we boarded the plane we waited for another 30 minutes because the captain had to do ""paperwork."" I will go back to flying Delta.",0
The flight went very well. The crew on board was attentive. The price of the flight was not expensive. Very good experience. 4th flight on Volotea without problem.,1
"Minneapolis to Fayetteville via Charlotte. Before catching the flight in Charlotte, in the last moment they have informed that the flight has been downgraded and 3 people doesn't have enough space. They didn't check for the priority. I am not sure on what basis they have stopped the 3 travelers out of all economy travelers. All 3 were Indians. They were not ready to arrange any other flight. The only flight which is available in AA is next day morning. They said they will arrange accommodation. But they have given a single room for all 3 of us. When i checked with manager to give separate rooms, he said it will be provided in the hotel. But when we reached there it was only 1 single double room and of us had to sleep on the floor. This is the very worst case I have ever seen with the airlines. They should consider the priorities before taking decisions. I would suggest not to take this airline.",0
"Absolutely terrible. Horrific customer service. I showed up long before my flight and was not aloud to enter because I was told I was too late. I sat there for thirty minutes arguing while I could see the plane, and their was no line to enter. The employees were no help and rather rude. I can not stress how terrible this company is. Do not use this company if avoidable. After everything that has happened with them I just hope I can save at least one person from having to support such a horrendous company. They make Spirit and Frontier look like first class service.",0
"Flight cancelled 2 days before departure, Lufthansa denied any responsibility and any help in finding solution. No refund. No interest in helping to solve problem caused by cancelling their flight. Reckless. Had to pay train ticket on my own cost instead.",0
"Orlando to Chicago via Fort Wayne. 2 cancelled flights due to weather. Next flight was not until 30 hours after original flight. I had to fly to a different city, Uber to my house then drive up to my family for Christmas the next morning. American Airlines offered no compensation for these expenses. I understand that weather is out of their control however, they just didn't seem to care.",0
"Because of a delay caused by weather we missed a connecting flight. However thats' not the issue. We arrived at Chicago late and missed a connection to Greenbay. We were put on a standby flight to be told that it was unlikely that we would get on. This was a Sunday evening. When we pressed for information about the next flight, we were told that this might be 8.30pm on Tuesday, as if this were not a problem. Pardon, not a problem! A family of three in the middle of Chicago, stranded for 3 days. There was no help at all. No useful information as to where we might go, what we could do, what transport we might be able to get. We were stranded and they did not give any assistance at all. It was a crisis for us. ",0
"Lisbon to Ponta Delgada. I find it absolutely disgusting of Ryanair to not let sit couples together without extra charge but instead choose random seats apart so that they are forced to pay for having the ""privilege"" to sit next to each other. My wife is afraid of flying, well done Ryanair squeezing out some extra bucks.",0
Flew Jacksonville to Atlanta. After earning a million mile status and retiring on a fixed income Delta Air Lines decided to dishonor that loyalty by flying empty first class seats instead of allowing me to use my Economy fare to upgrade. So now you have to buy an upgraded ticket to upgrade? Jetblue has more legroom and better planes.,0
"Melbourne to Auckland. Delayed out of Melbourne and IFE rebooted during Taxi. Despite delay arrived in Auckland on time and no further issues with IFE once departed. Good quality meal with 3 choices on a relatively short flight, the beef brisket was very tasty as was dessert. Attendant was willing to give me a couple drinks at once, full cans too as opposed to a plastic cup as I have experienced with other airlines. Extremely genuine, friendly and competent flight attendants. I've traditionally avoided Qantas in favour of airlines like Emirates, Qatar or Singapore, but was impressed with them and I will likely use them in the future. I chose Qantas this time because of baggage allowance of 30k being included where it would cost more with others on this route, good departure time from Melbourne and competitive pricing. baggage above 23k on others would have potentially incurred hundreds of dollars in fees.",1
"Gatwick to Orlando. Flight delayed by 4 hours with no communication from ground staff. Delay occurred following our progression through the gate but before boarding so we were kept in the gate area with not enough seating and no food or drink for four hours. Staff on flight were rude and saw no need to provide any level of customer service. After flight it was clear that there had been a mix up with luggage but there was no one from the airline available to help, due to the delay it was now 2am and we were stranded without our luggage and no assistance. I called Norwegian helpline and informed them that my telephone credit was about to run out and requested they call me back but they refused to do so. Phone credit ran out and I was left with no way of contacting Norwegian and no suitcase. I emailed the airline with a complaint over a month ago and never received any kind of response. I'm sure they are fine if everything runs smoothly but as soon as there is an issue they are completely i equipped to deal with it.",0
"Only one counter open for baggage drop off, thus long line. We reached baggage line 100 minutes before boarding and still in the line when boarding time started. None of the staff were courteous enough to take passengers ahead who's boarding time has started. We had to run with kids and not sure if we will make the flight through security. Gate staff behaving as if it is our fault they had one counter open to take baggage. Lot of anxiety, passengers from back jumping in front, passengers from later flights telling us what to do. Very bossy and annoying. mismanagement. Incompetent staff thinking we just made it as if it was our fault.",0
"I had to fly from Atlanta GA to Hartford CT for work. I got early flight and came to the gate on time. All people were there waiting for them to start boarding. One hour later we are still in line with no explanation what is going on. One hour later we got to the plane, but we still have to wait another hour to leave our gate. Not the first time when they got delayed for hours without any reason.",0
Syracuse to Denver. Worst experience ever.  They should not be allowed to stay in business. If any other business in America treated their customers like I was treated today they would be out of business. Don't fly American airlines or especially their regional PSA.,0
The ground crew were unreasonable and very rude. We were denied boarding as according to them we were 4 minutes late.  The ground crew did a lousy job of offloading our luggage. We had to wait almost half a day in the baggage carousel before filling a missing bag report.,0
"Flew Mesa, AZ to Missouri. Fantastic airline! Very clean and the plane was roomy. I highly recommend Allegiant Air to friends and family! Easy check in and the lines move fast. Very professional personnel.",1
Dubai to Brisbane via Hong Kong with Cathay Pacific. Both flights were very good. Flights left and arrived on time or a fraction earlier. Very good service and food. On the overnight flight from Dubai a supper was served then a continental breakfast in the morning. This enabled more sleeping time. Seats were good and flat bed. The only improvement which could be made would be for a mattress cover to be provided as is done by Qantas. It helps smooth out the bumps in the seat. The entertainment system is also good. The additional bonus of Cathay is the use of the Wings lounge in Hong Kong. Probably the best shower rooms of any lounge we have used. We will fly Cathay again.,1
We travelled on several flights from Sydney to Cairns to Ayers Rock to Melbourne in March 2013. All flights were pretty much on time planes were quite clean and cabin staff pleasant. Drinks and snacks were well served. We booked extra legroom on all these flights and being by the wing exits these also had the advantage of no recline intrusion from the seats in front. Check ins were good and one admin error on one leg was dealt with without a drama. Prices were OK and we'd gladly travel Virgin Australia again.,1
"I booked a flight from Chicago to San Antonio three months in advance. The day of my flight, I was there 2 hrs early only to be informed that my flight was canceled 10 min before my arrival. So instead, American Airlines assigned me a new route which required me to stop in Dallas and then onto San Antonio. The plane was not ready for flight so we had to wait another 2hrs. This is not my worst experience with flying but still, it's the fact of the matter. If I showed up late to my flight, canceled, or had to switch, American Airlines would charge me for that mistake. But when the airline screws up, canceling my flight with no notice whatsoever, there are no consequences. ",0
Tampa to Charleston. I fly this airline twice a month and it is delayed every time. The communication from the airline is terrible and the gate personnel have no idea because nobody tells them.,0
I am an emergency room physician. My wife and i are both over 60. Shame on Allegiant for risking my life and those of the other 100 or so people on that plane by not following basic protocols for social distancing. We arrive at the airport and loading instead of being done in a organized fashion maintaining the 6 feet spacing is business as usual as people are standing on top of each other in the aisles. After landing in Niagara Falls it was really bad as no attempt to keep people seated to offload appropriately was even tried. In addition people are on the place not wearing a mask. Middle seats were not left open. It was business as usual.,0
"I will never fly Air Canada again. They delayed my flight over an hour and instead of holding the connecting flight for 10 minutes for the many people on the late flight they have us a 6 hour lay over. I saw they had a large standby list for that flight so I get the feeling they delayed it specifically to accommodate them while still taking my money. Horrible customer service, flight attendants were rude, and zero compensation for the costs I will incur having to stay in a different city.",0
Madrid to Granada. Excellent. Efficient and attentive cabin crew. Arrived and left on time. New aircraft and comfortable seats. Straightforward boarding and disembarking. Highly recommended.,1
"Prague to Keflavik. I currently live in Iceland, so I travel a lot and always with Wizz. Every time I fly the experience is worse and worse so I finally decided to write a review. Price is far too high for low fare and once you look up for a certain flight, every time you look at it, it is more expensive. Not talking about overpriced baggage or if you travel with someone they will never let you sit next to each other even when half the plane is empty. Stewards are rude. Planes are usually dirty from the previous flight. If there is another low fare option in the market I would not go with Wizz anymore.",0
"I bought a ticket for a flight from Ecuador to Russia with Aeromexico and Air France. The day after the purchase, I received a letter that one of the flights was changed, the new route was not suitable for me, because I do not have a visa to Europe and I was not able to fly on the new changed route. In this connection, an involuntary refund was issued, the money for which the airline does not want to return. Today is March 7th 2022 and support is just ignoring my refund messages.",0
I flew Rouge from Toronto to Phoenix despite the reviews. The reviews are correct. The biggest issue is the seat size. This is a good airline for children as they have enough legroom. For half the flight I stood in the galley because it hurt too much to sit in a 29 inch seat for 5 hours. There is also a problem with the inflight entertainment as it offers very little if you use an Apple product. Hopefully another carrier will provide some competition.,0
My daughter and I took CZ 329 from Guangzhou to Vancouver on June 02 2013. Our seats were not able to be arranged together when we checked in at the airport. The Stewardess tried their best to readjust 3 groups of people's seats finally all of us were satisfied. My 5 years old daughter could lie down beside me and could see out of the window! I really appreciated the help.,1
Portland to Frankfurt. I bought a business class ticket for myself and my sister for our flight to Frankfurt. They took our money and did not deliver the service. My sister got business class seat and I was given an economy seat on 22C. The captain apologized but I have two joint replacements and was very uncomfortable. There was no mention of reimbursement of my business class ticket. I feel ripped off.,0
"United turn our family vacation into a living hell! Flew to Miami to board a cruise and they sent our bag to another flight, so we had to wait 3 hours to get our bag. We almost didn't make it in time for the cruise. On our way back to Chicago there was a 3 hour delay. We also had to spend an hour on the plane before we took off. The flight attendant refused to give us a second Biscoff snack because they only allowed one snack per passenger. We had to pay for our kids' food even after the Captain said we were going to get ""free service"" as a token of appreciation for all the ""inconvenience."" We have the United Plus credit card, but we'll never fly United again.",0
This flight was booked on Monday 16 March. Received an email on 17 March informing me the flight is due to be cancelled. Was phoned on 18 March to say the flight has been cancelled. 204 days later and still no refund! Absolutely shocking customer service. I will never use this airline again. Shame on you.,0
"From Perth to Melbourne for a conference on 13th, day before cancelled to fly out at around 5pm with Qantas then delayed until after 8, eventually arrived in Melbourne accomodation at 4am. Had to be at conference at 8am. To add insult to injury today we are again cancelled and rescheduled to leave at 6.50pm after our initial booking was at 10am. I will never fly with Jetstar again",0
Los Angeles to Dublin. The planes was old and appeared tired and worn out. The service was minimal similar to a low cost airline. I had to buy wine or beer to have with my meal. Breakfast was bistro bun in a box. There was little interaction from cabin staff. The entertainment system had a limited choice of old movies. It was a sad reflection of Ireland national airline.,0
"Valencia to Casablanca via Lisbon. Our flight was delayed so we missed our connection. They arranged everything ahead for us, including a 4 star hotel overnight with meals, hotel transfers, airport meal vouchers and a flight the next day. Our luggage went straight through so we didn't have to check in again. Great experience, they looked after everything and would use them again!",1
"I have been a loyal American Airlines passenger since 2007. I flew with them for both business travel and my personal travel. In the last 2 years or so, their customer service has plummeted. My final straw was this morning when, to not fault of AA, I missed my flight by one minute because of a delay in the Queens Tunnel and the TSA baggage screening system breaking down and chaos happening. However, their gate agent, was one of the most unhelpful, rude and downright hateful persons I have ever met. This is the third time in a row I have had to email a complaint because AA employees treat their passengers like garbage. I carry their credit card, I'm usually a Platinum or higher flyer and I currently have over 500,000 miles to show for my loyalty. I am now going to switch to Delta, where I have no status, because I will no longer give my money to a company that treats their passengers the way American does time and time again. I suggest anyone reading this do the same.",0
"Flight operated by Ohana for Hawaiian. Thirty five minute flight from KIA to OGG. Aircraft clean and tidy drinks offered en route. Being a small commuter plane very cramped but not a problem on such a short flight. Departed and arrived on time, no complaints.",1
"Booked a flight home on that date about 4 pm then at 10.30pm get a text saying flights cancelled and they transferred me to the 6.00 am time, Thats fine but i had a hire car, they dont open until 7am. I tried to ring Virgin to get the flight put back to a later time. They had no one to talk to about it, they open at 5am i was flying out at 6am and i had to leave the hire car at a service station. To me not having someone to talk to is pathetic by them, ok I got it done but the stress levels went through the roof that should not have happened.",0
"Flew Air Canada from Montreal to San Jose. We were so disappointed to see that the experience for the travellers is the least of Air Canada's concerns. No TV, no food for a 6 hour flight seems unreasonable. The time allowed to transfer from one flight to another is far too short and we got no assistance whatsoever even though we were travelling with kids. Overall very poor. We won't travel with Air Canada Rouge ever again.",0
"London to Tel Aviv via Helsinki. After paying for the ticket, a week later I realised that I don't really want to fly. I called Finnair, and at first they told me about a week to 10 days. I decided to wait, after a week with no refund I call again this time they said a week to 10 business day, a week later they said because the corona outbreak it may take 20 business days. I'm still waiting for the refund.",0
"I return from LAX to YVR with Air Canada Rouge. I'm 6'2"". There is no legroom. I had my knees against the front seat and my lower back pressured against my seat the entire flight. Extremely uncomfortable and unmanageable. My knees were half way through my neighbours seats. I have always flown Air Canada to have legroom. This time is now over and they now have lost a long time client. I have flown with low cost carriers in Asia and you expect what you pay for. Here you get less for the same price as before.",0
"Spirit Airlines decided to bump me up to another flight without explanation. I called them to make sure I was to receive a voucher for the 12 hours overlay versus 4 hours in my original reservation. I was guaranteed one voucher by a Spirit agent that I was to receive a hotel voucher. Guess what, when time to claim my voucher arrives nobody was home. I accepted the new itinerary based on the voucher. Spirit lied to me and they did not honor their promises. Now I have to buy 2 extra nights at hotels because Spirit decided to bump me up without any considerations to the impact or satisfaction of their customer. I could have bought a American Airlines ticket with the two extra night. Horrible customer services. I hope they go bankrupt. Stay away from those liars.",0
"Now I have had 2 cancelled flights, horrible service from reservations, countless emails to correct the situation and now my original ticket will not be honored and they are increasing cost to twice as much for economy. My flight has gone from March 26 return to May 5th to May 18 at my cost and then they are sticking it to me for my return flight. No morals, no values!",0
Unprofessional employees. They act like my problem is not their problem. Worst customer service ever received at Orlando. I had to buy a ticket from Southwest to get home. No refund from Spirit nor even a referral to another airline to get home. Do they want to be on be in business or not?,0
"Ryanair cabin crew makes me worried as a passenger, they seem to be under enormous pressure, anxious, worried, sometimes with unnecessarily alarmed speech, other times with too slow or prostrate diction. The company tries to save on everything even when the passenger asks for a simple receipt for the service provided. The Irish authorities need to be brought to the attention of the EU to comply with consumer rights, particularly in terms of taxation. While Ryanair is largely responsible for stimulating the local economy, the social, tax and environmental cost is also very high. I will continue to complain to the Portuguese Tax Authority for this company to fulfil its obligations, not least because it is very keen to take advantage of national financial funds when available. Boarding on time, unfriendly crew and dirty planes.",0
"Horrible experience during covid 19 travel restrictions. I had a one way ticket back from Australia to Singapore on Qantas and a one way ticket up from Singapore to Australia on Scoot. When the travel restrictions kicked in, I got an email confirmation from Scoot on the refund of travel credits. With Qantas, I have not gotten any email confirmation and what's worse is that my booking has now disappeared from their website. Their call centre agents speak condescendingly and very rudely. I would strongly recommend not booking with Qantas despite their competitive prices as it has been a really terrible experience for my family and me.",0
"Due to the omission of the documents, I missed this flight. I am very grateful to China Southern Airlines staff for helping to reschedule my flight, and they took the initiative to leave my contact information. Timely remind me of my flight time and other relevant information, the service attitude is very good, so I give praise to the staff of China Southern Airlines.",1
"April 19, 2022 purchased a ticket for my sister to fly down to visit me. May 27, 2022 flight boarded and went out on tarmac, pilot turned plane around and went back to gate stating mechanical issues. Everyone got off plane and waited at gate area. 45 minutes later announced flight was canceled. Sister went to desk and advised refund since there wasn't another flight out until Monday the 30th which was the day she was to fly back home. She filled out paperwork to issue refund to my ccard. June 1st, 2022 a refund issued back to my ccard for 197.00 and of course you can not get thru to anyone on their customer service phone line and no online chat people available. Why did they only refund less than half of the ticket? did they think she was going to fly back to Michigan when she didnt have a flight to Florida? Absolutely ridiculous.",0
El Paso  to Houston. My family and I are never flying with United again! All their on time again and again slogans are bogus. Save yourself the hassle and your valuable time.,0
"Flew Las Vegas to Frankfurt. Two times Condor forced me to pay for the choice of seat. The first time after buying a ticket, the second time on check in. Money has not been returned. Did not receive any apologize.",0
"Dubai to Warsaw with Emirates. My seats, selected 3 month before the flight, were changed without any notice. When we boarded a plane they told me that they cannot do anything about that because aircraft was full. Seat belt was not working and the seat was broken. When we complain about it three times they said that they will check what can be done and will let us know. No one came to explain anything. We were really disappointed.",0
Budapest to Zurich via Vienna. A complete disaster due to late arrival of the aircraft I lost my connection and I had to stay overnight in Vienna. I arrived in Zurich with 14 hours delay and my bag was delayed.,0
"Frontier once again lived up to its star rating of 1.5. My flight was scheduled to depart at 2.00 pm, arrive Tampa 4.50 pm. The first delay came 3 hours prior to take off, then another delay, and then another, now we are at a departure time of 9.00 pm. The last delay posted had departure at 9.45 pm. Finally after sitting at the airport for 5 long uncomfortable hours the flight was cancelled. If I could curse and swear on this review, I surely would. No more cheap Frontier airfares out of Trenton for me ever again.",0
"I recently flew on fastjet from Johannesburg to Harare. The flight was delayed by almost an hour due to technical issues on the aircraft. They made us wait for almost one hour in the bus while they fixed the aircraft. I did not feel safe at all while flying and I was extremely disappointed. While up in the air the aircraft was making a really strange squeaky noise which was very unsettling considering that the aircraft had some sort of technical issues. Terrible experience overall, would not recommend at all.",0
"Nha Trang to New York via Guangzhou. Transfer at Guangzhou simple and clear. Boeing 777 from Guangzhou to NYC was very nice with spacious seats in business class, meanwhile children were very happy to enjoy the IFE, and had good rest too. I liked the food, such as beef soup noodle and hot pot rice. Patient and efficient  flight attendants. Just a pity no WiFi was provided during the trip. A nice journey in general.",1
"I booked a flight with Vietnam Airlines before the covid crisis. As so many flights, it got cancelled, not their fault at all. They offered me a rebooking, which I had to pay an additional fee for. Now they cancelled my second flight, too, and told me that I won't get any refund, not even a voucher. This is unacceptable, they keep my money, make me pay a fee for a flight change and now keep that too.",0
Beirut to Stansted via Larnaca on Cobalt. Cobalt is a budget airline so all services are unbundled. No meals or refreshments were purchased. I will fly Cobalt Airlines whenever I can.,1
Great service non stop LHR to Manila and back. Flights on time staff pleasant and efficient. Will only use this airline for future trips to Philippines!,1
"Left Hong Kong 1hr and 20 min late but received text notification. Made up 45 minutes of this en route to Beijing. Economy cabin full yet felt spacious, clean and new. Service was excellent and the meal closest to the best I've had in economy for some time, in fact this was better then parent company Cathay Pacific can offer in Premium Economy.",1
"San Jose to Beijing return. Very good overall experience. The food is way better than U.S based airlines. There are enough beverages and snacks from the mini bar on the back of the cabin, including hot tea, coconut milk and oreos. They also provided eye mask, ear plug and hot towel.",1
"A domestic Airblue flight from Karachi to Lahore. On the aircraft staff were courteous. Served simple refreshments. I requested a vegetarian option which was provided. The flight crew included German pilot and a steward. There were some passengers who chose to sit on other seats than the ones allocated. Staff politely asked the passengers to return to allotted seats. The passengers were stubborn, insisting they can sit wherever they like. I admired the persistence of and professionalism of the staff and passengers returned to their original seats. On arrival at Lahore the luggage arrived quickly. ",1
"I use EVA frequently for work. Every single month. When the EVA strike was taking place many of my booked flights were cancelled with no compensation or apology. I was not given anything for the trips I had to miss and all complaints to EVA were shut down and ignored. Then when I had to miss a booked flight because of a family emergency I was not allowed to board the return flight I had already booked nor could I get a refund without incurring huge fees, equal to the price of the flight. The whole process is meant to charge you more and force you to book another flight, despite the fact you're already paid for the missed one in full. I arrived at the airport after a long and tiring trip trying to get home and had to book another seat at triple the cost even though I already had a seat booked on the flight. Very very disappointing, as EVA was one of my favourite airlines. Will not be reviewing my membership or flying with them again. Sad they treat loyal members this way, and no effort was made whatsoever from staff to help solve the situation. Just mechanical responses like ""sorry for the inconvenience.""",0
Horrible. Wait times are excessive. Flights keep getting delayed.  God forbid you ask someone who works there what is going on. You get the I don't know it could be anything. You mean like you don't have enough staff and to many flights. So all the consumers suffer.,0
"Sydney to Melbourne is a rather short flight so economy is fine. I booked the day before  with Virgin Australia so was more expensive than normal. Aisle seat in row 4 with middle seat open. Left a few minutes late, arrived a few early, and uneventful. All very well organized, boarding, cabin service, equipment, all well oiled machine. Cabin crew very quick, efficient still friendly. Amazes me how you can keep smiling non stop at all this strangers. Coffee surprisingly good. Lunch was egg sandwich, interestingly packed, quite tasty. I read newspaper and did some work, so did not use entertainment at all.",1
"Washington to Bangalore via Dubai. On all my flights, I am able to mention during booking the kind of food i would like on my flight. While booking my flight to go home, I couldn't do it on this occasion. Note that this was my first time on Emirates. I checked the website and all it gave was the menu and nothing else. Apparently, I should have given them a call and told them what I wanted for a meal but it didn't say so anywhere. It turns out that I was given fish to eat which i did, not knowing what it was. And when i raised a complaint with Emirates a couple months later, they blamed me saying I should have called them to say so. Nowhere was the instruction given that I need to do that. How am I supposed to know? During the flight, when I got a second meal, that's when I asked and they changed my meal, not even apologizing for the mistake they made. I only got to know after I got home that I had fish for lunch! Disgusting.",0
"United is getting worse every time I fly. The planes are always dirty, seats are too small and people are crammed in like sardines with their knees in their stomachs, if you drop something there is no way to retrieve it until after the plane lands because conditions are so cramped and flight attendants are constantly ill mannered and rude. I booked through a third party and ended up with United only coming home. They did not tell me I would be charged to bring my luggage home until flight check in, the other airline did not charge for any of my bags. This racket is not acceptable. I was not forced to pay or abandon my luggage at the last possible moment. Then when we landed my luggage was filthy dirty and had foot prints on it. Now I know why I have broken items every time I fly United. They will not honor my accumulated miles. Apparently I do not meet the acceptable conditions, not sure what the miles are for if I can never redeem them. I am incentivized to gain these points that I cannot use when I try. Same with the flight vouchers for delayed and cancelled flights. I tried to use my last voucher and was denied over and over until it finally expired during covid. I called to request an extension and was denied. Finally to the female flight attendant on the flight from Orlando to Denver on January 19th, do not run into my children with your beverage cart. My kids were asleep and due to the minuscule size of the seats their legs had dipped into the aisle. First they were shoved aside, then run into with the beverage cart. The last time my three year old was run into the female flight attendant hit her so hard as she walked past that she actually pushed the baby off the seat. My children should not have been touched in the first place let alone harmed multiple times as they attempted to sleep through the flight. Life is hard right now for everyone, there is no reason to make it worse.",0
"Durban to Johannesburg. FA 477 and 478 always have faults and flights are delayed. My wife and I commute between Durban and Johannesburg. This is the second time now that one of her flights will be 3hrs delayed. This is entirely unacceptable and inexcusable. We spend so much money for this ridiculous service with poorly trained staff. Wake up and stop stealing our time, money and energy.",0
"Ho Chi Minh to Denpasar. They charged me 30 dollars for 1kg over exceed of cabin baggage. I payed and took a bag, they said they need to check it in. How on earth they decided that i cant bring my bag with me is beyond comprehension, especially when i took the laptop from the bag now the baggage was 6.5 kg. I said, what now?",0
I have used Onur Airline on a few trips to Turkey. The plane was fairly new and the boarding was great the staff were very good friendly and helpful we were delayed for 1hr but the pilot made up the time. The passengers gave the pilot a very loud applause on both journeys but I think this is typical of us Scots. Just to inform you Onur Airline still hands out free pillows and blankets not like other airline companies where they want you to purchase them. I will certainly be using the airline again.,1
Delta flight from West Palm beach to La Guardia was delayed since 1 PM. Now they announced that we might take off at 7 PM. If you do the math that's 6 hours of wasted personal time and unnecessary inconvenience. I promised myself to never fly with Delta ever again! Worst experience with this unprofessional and careless company.,0
Toronto to Montreal segment was delayed by 55 mins and my connection with another airline from Montreal was not possible. The airline was not ready to compensate for missed flights and the inconvenience it caused. The airline should compensate the customer for the inconvenience in situations like this. Customer service was very unhelpful.,0
I was booked to fly on Aug. 2nd from Athens to Luton. The day before I contracted a contagious virus causing severe diarrhea and vomiting. I called up the airline trying to change the booking to a later date and they told me that it was not possible and that I had to fly that day. I had to buy another ticket but dread the thought that maybe some day a person with a contagious virus might be sitting next to me.,0
"Excellent flight, very happy with the service we received right check in till disembarkation including the transit transportation in Doha. We had the shortest transit of 20 minutes. Special mention and thanks to Mr Tushar, Steward on QR028. He is the most efficient and kindest inflight staff we have ever met",1
"We had one of our bags badly damaged on a flight in June 2022 and contacted Qantas customer care. After a few emails and pictures they sent us an email in July 2022 staying the replacement bag has been ordered and we will receive it shortly. After 7 months and many emails to Qantas I have no replacement bag and not a single reply from them. I called the booking line today and the lady there did a bit of digging and found out my case had been closed and she cannot look into it, she advised me to open a whole new case and reference my old case number. So I started the process all over again, maybe it might get sorted before 2024. Qantas is a joke and I hate having to fly with them now. We need more airlines to make them wake up and sort out their customer service, or lack of it.",0
Kisumu to Nairobi. It was my first time to fly with 540. I arrived relatively early for my flight because I was travelling with a toddler. The check in Counter in Kisumu was not yet open so I had to wait almost an hour which was not a Problem. Finally I saw that the Check in was open and decided to check in. I had two 20kg bags. One for me and another for my son because he had his own seat. Shock on me when i went they told me my son has excess baggage. How was this possible when I checked and rechecked on their Website and confirmed that the allowance for him is also 20kg. Then the guy who was checking me in even confirmed with his colleague that the allowance for my child is only 10Kg. After much arguing he gave up and took my bags. Later at the waiting Lounge I Googled and confirmed that he also has 20kg like me. shame on you Fly 540. Your employees are scammers and will try to get whatever they can from customers. if they had found some inexperienced customers who dont know the rules they would have duped him. Then add to the fact that the flight had an almost 2 hour delay with no communication whatsoever from you. And no apology . Will never fly 540. Was the first time and definitely the last.,0
My husband and I did an Oman Air Eid Package Tour to Sri Lanka in August. It was excellent value for money. The flights were on time and very pleasant. The vegetable curry that I had for dinner on our return trip was one of the best I have eaten. A range of alcohol was available for the passengers who fancied a drink with their meal.,1
The worst flight I have ever experienced and will never recommend this airline. All the customers services and how they treat their customers could be better.,0
"Frankfurt to Hyderabad via Bahrain. We booked this ticket for my mom who cannot speak English, flying from Dallas to Hyderabad via American Airlines. We requested for wheelchair assistance and we double confirmed before fly. American Airlines helped my mom well from Dallas. Once she landed in Frankfurt her hard time started. The wheel chair assistance people left her at wrong gate, none of the Gulf Air staff responded or helped by any means. She had to travel to other terminal by carrying her luggage. Almost the same situation at Bahrain Airport from Gulf staff. Another experience was air hostess were not ready to help her in keeping luggage. Now she is sick after reaching home.",0
We fly fairly regularly to Mauritius. Having used BA not bad although timings now not great and also Emirates great planes disastrous customer service when a problem occurs. So despite my slight reservations we flew with Air Mauritius. Very pleased we did. The staff were friendly helpful and couldn't have been nicer both on the way out and on the return. Food ok usual airline food. Seats although not fully flat bed very comfortable and every bit as comfortable as BA. Flight timings in and out of London superb. A non stop flight out of Heathrow. We will use them again.,1
"Seats available but they split the family, leave the kids by themselves. I need to pray to my kids don't spills soda on the next passenger. It's not because the 50 bucks to change 4 seats. The company has no ethics or consideration for the consumer. Do you think that 50 for 4 seats will change the company's results?",0
Budapest to Malta. Worst airline travelled with. Both flights had delays of 1 hour which caused alot of inconvenience to my trip. Had to pay double the price at the airport for the large cabin bag which I hadn't pay for before. Very unprofessional service.,0
"Perth to Melbourne. At 62 years of age my experience with Tigerair was the worst airline experience ever. The flight was cancelled on the same day I was flying. I had paid for my accommodation and a training course at my destination but apparently that was just bad luck... sorry for the inconvenience in spite of explains it had taken me a while to save the necessary money. I was told there were no more available flights to book me on for a couple of days in spite of advertised flights online with available seats. Oh and in spite of advising I did not have the money to book another airline, they further advised it would take 10 days to get my money back.  I believe their partners as in this case was Gotogate overbook and then cancel those who paid the least, as I didn't take any of the many promoted add ons. I highly recommend paying extra with a decent and reputable airline over a cheaper airline that pushes add ons and then dumps you from the flight. I will not get back my paid accommodation or course money.",0
I flew business class from Singapore to Delhi two days ago and the service was extremely poor and shoddy. We were flying in from Brisbane by Singapore Airlines and took the flight to Delhi after a stop over at Changi airport. So I was in a position to compare the service on two flights of the same airlines. While on the flight from Brisbane the service was good on the flight to Delhi the hostess was pretty bad in her interpersonal conduct  very poor communication skills overbearing almost irritating. On a late night flight a little courtesy helps a traveller relax but it was surely lacking. Pretty disappointed after all the slick advertising the real experience was shockingly bad. Money badly spent.,0
"London to Lahore. The ticket I purchased stated we would be flying in a Boeing 777 but we boarded a Boeing 747 Older model. Moody flight attendants. None of the TVs worked, the food was cold and stale. Poor service and no one cares about it.",0
"Flew from Toronto to CDG on the upper deck of a 747. Upper deck is slightly more expensive than lower deck economy but every penny was worth it as it was the best Transatlantic flight I have been on. I have flown with Air Transat, Air Canada, British Airways, KLM, and Austrian Airlines across the Atlantic, but Air France was easily the best experience. The cabin was clean, the seats were very comfortable, the food was good, the entertainment was especially noteworthy, and the flight attendants were also some of the best that I have flown with. ",1
"Mexico City to Buenos Aires. The boarding process was without any problem, we could change our seats because the aircraft wasn't full, Aeromexico provides you with free whatsapp and a little amenity kit with earplugs and a mask, dinner and breakfast. The dinner was ok but the breakfast was excellent, the FA were polite. The legroom is quite good but recline could improve. In general a great experience. The return flight only the check in process was terrible but the rest fo the overall experience was as good as the first flight, well the food was better in the second flight. Both flights arrived on time. IFE could have more movie or tv series options.",1
"The staff are friendly. The plane was cold, we were shivering, they gave light blankets but they were not enough. Meals were basic. Entertainment was basic. Luggage is delayed, today is day 6 and BA staff over the phone say ""call after 72 hours"". Tracking system is very vague, had to extract information from staff that they arrived to Vancouver on Jan 2nd. I offered to collect baggage but very vague answer ""call the Airport"", asked her for BA phone number at YVR but she said ""we don't have a phone number for you to call, call the main Airport"". Their policy states you can make a claim only after 21 days.",0
"Allegiant Air travel insurance and cancellation policies are extremely deceptive. You purchase these so changes or cancellations can be made without additional fees, right? But they don't inform you of the additional charges for cancellations. And that if you do it online you get a fee for that too. And they are a no refund company as well. So just kiss your money goodbye. We just won't go to how rude customer service is. So rude, would not let me speak, kept speaking over me.",0
"Flew from Manchester to Toronto. If you have an alternative then take it. I take about 20 flights a year on various airlines. Air Canada rouge has been the worst. The food is poor, its poor on Air Canada too. There's no TV, you have to take your own iPad or similar, and there's nowhere to charge it. They even charge you for using your own iPad and your own electricity. All alcohol is paid for and tickets are not cheap. It's a budget airline at premium prices. Easyjet could teach them a thing or two. I only used the flight to avoid having to fly via London. They should take the e off the end of rouge and put an h there. Air Canada Rough, much closer to the facts.",0
Nha Trang to Danang. We had four flights with this unprofessional company and two out of the four flights were cancelled without notice and the other two were delayed in total by 5 hours. Totally pathetic and quite honestly puts me off ever coming back. There so called customer is non existent and totally disrespectful. They simply refused to assist. Never fly with them.,0
Outbound 5th November on DAT 21 return 8th November DAT 22. Flew Esbjerg to Stavanger. Small aircraft with some 14 seats. Full lunch meal served by one of the pilots with free drinks to take from the back of the aircraft. Security taken seriously.,1
Flew Helsinki to Manchester via Stockholm with SAS Scandinavian. First flight was delayed by 25 minutes with no explanation. Second flight also delayed for 70 minutes. Actually been waiting 90 minutes so far at Stockholm with no explanation or update on delay. First and last time using this airline. A complete shambles.,0
"Pucallpa to Lima. LATAM, previously LAN in Peru, used to be an excellent airline but their service has deteriorated significantly in the last year. The latest sign of their downward spiral is the increase in flight delays and cancellations. They are constantly delaying domestic flights, almost on a whim, and display no regret or sincere apology to their paying customers. The personnel is entitled, condescending and rude, treating customers like inconveniences.  Not to mention that they charge for everything. I've tried to remain with them out of loyalty to LAN and in hopes that they might show the high quality of customer service as they did in the past, but I believe it's time to move on. I cannot in good faith recommend LATAM to anyone. They are not worth our money.",0
The worst experience ever. They cancel our flight and had to stay a night longer on my own expenses. Unfriendly staff. My friend's luggage got lost. So many issues and I had to stay the whole day on a standby flight which could not get in and 3.5 in customer service line up.,0
"Super Air Jet is a pretty new airline. As a foreign traveller I had to face their inexperience. The english website collapsed constantly, especially when I tried to cancel my flight in time. After many hours of trying I had to give up. The next day my friend tried it on the Indonesian website of the company and there it worked. But it was too late, I missed the deadline. Still I was guaranteed 10 percent of the base fare. 60 days have passed and I've not received even a penny. In times of Covid 19, it should be possible to cancel the flight online. I would definitely not recommend to use that airline. Unless they do some big changes on their online performance. An unhappy customer",0
Flight was delayed twice because their employees were late and calling off. Everyone at the gate was notified by phone first before the gate attendant decided to say something. Very annoyed.,0
Flights are constantly delayed or canceled. I was on a flight from Paris to BWI with a change of planes at their main hub in Iceland. What a disaster that turned into. We were bused to the old NATO base and put up in a WOW hostel with limited access to anything. We were told we would be put on our same flight the next day. This never happened. The flight was actually to Boston instead of BWI. We were we then where switched to a different airlines after a 3 hour layover. We finally got to BWI around 11 pm instead of the 5.30 pm arrival time. I missed the train and was forced to take a taxi to DC which cost almost 100 bucks. While stuck in Iceland we had no contact from a wow representative. Their communication method was ridiculous. Posting notes on the wall in the lobby of their hostel. Mine was not the only flight cancelled that same day. At least 2 more coming from Different cities in Europe were cancelled as well.,0
Tivat to Moscow via Belgrade was late 3 hours and 32 passengers missed connect flight! We were put in filthy Slavia hotel in Belgrade. I reached Moscow only in the evening on the second day. My claim report wasn't answered!,0
"The worst airline to book, had a flight for today booked, I just added on a child on the phone and it turns out the lady changed the whole date of the flight without me knowing and nobody on the crew wanted to help me, they gave me their worst attitudes even though we were polite and tried to explain our situation. They were impatient and no help at all, they kept questioning our decisions and kept giving their personal views on it. I had proof that their side was wrong and I had emails stating that I was on this flight, and forwarded the email as they wanted to 10 times and it kept saying sent and they claimed that they never received it and didn't want to do anything, and I called directly to Allegiant when I made the child change no other 3rd party. I called customer service and 5 hours later and nothing, haven't talked to no one, and we don't know what to do.",0
"Naples to New York via Milan. Air Italy lost my suitcase and the customer care was impossible to contact. I called the number 078952600, they transfered my call and never answer, I tried to call back and they picked up and hang up right away. This is shameful! Customer care on facebook was handled by automatic responses and was telling me to do the things I had already done. Even if the flight was good overall, such a treatment has to be condemned. I will never fly Air Italy again.",0
"Honestly it is the worst airline I have ever tried in my life. Never again. My flight from Male was supposed to depart on 7 may 2022 however after doing all the process and entering the plane after 3 hours of delay, Saudia decided to cancel the flight just before departure. Imagine we were inside the plane and they told us to go out as the crew need to rest. What a stupid excuse. Everyone was shocked and thought its a joke. However it was a nightmare as we have to wait in the airport for 24 hours for their next flight. None of the crew where giving any explanation beside they were so rude, arogant and unprofessional. Anyway i learned my lesson never ever fly with cheap dirty and unprofessional airline like Saudia.",0
. Kellie at the check in and baggage area was extremely helpful to us. We had acquired a lot of souvenirs and our bags were overweight. She helped us redistribute weight and gave us one complimentary bag check for free. It was super stressful and embarrassing but she was so kind and gracious to us. Made us feel a lot better. Thank you Alaska for employing kind people who enjoy making customers happy.,1
Flew QF7 SYD to Dallas 16th November 2013 in premium economy. Friendly flight crew as we boarded via priority boarding in Sydney. Sparkling wine OJ water offered by friendly flight attendant. This is a long flight of almost 15 hours that went much quicker than one would expect. Possibly due to plenty of food and great wine. Premium economy is very similar to domestic business class. The fact Qantas offer snacks including toasted sandwiches at any time during flight really equals business minus not economy plus. Seat comfortable and highly rate row 36 bulk head seats with plenty of room. Overall a great flight with okay service.,1
"I had booked a flight from Los Angeles to Cancun via Mexico City to fly out on the 25th of March 2020. I get a notice from Interjet 1 day before my flight that all international flights have been cancelled due to the Corona Virus. I went to change my flight to another date and they want to charge me 139 dollars each way since I did not make the change 24 hours prior to my flight?! How are they not going to honor my change when Interjet didn't even give myself a 24 hour notice? So they are going to notify me on March 24,2020 about international flight cancellation and I try to adjust my flight on that same day and they want to charge me 139.00 each way for not changing 24 hours in advance?! I wasn't even asking for a refund! How is that even possible! It's not even about the money anymore. Its about principle! Do what is right Interjet and stop being so greedy!  We are being unfairly charged for these flights that Interjet is not reimbursing! All other airlines are reimbursing their customers with no issues, but Interjet is not!",0
"Heathrow to Malta. We were a party of 4 adults and one child. Staff were miserable. Hot food had to be ordered, but no one asked if we wanted anything. When we asked for a toastie it was like being told off for not ordering it. Drinks and food were served with a pay machine shoved in your face. The staff didnt even stop their conversation whilst serving us. When leaving the aeroplane, as always we said thankyou and again they couldnt acknowledge us or stop their conversation. One of our suitcases was ripped, got in a queue behind 5 others who had damaged cases. Our case was beyond repair and needed a new one to fly home with. 1 day of our 10 day holiday was spent getting a taxi to the nearest town, finding a shop that sold cases then taxi back to the hotel.",0
"Memphis to Charlotte with American Airlines. The scanners were broken leaving them to enter each seat in manually. The crew was rude one even ran onto the plane to pull someone off because he miswrote the seat into the computer. The plane from Memphis to Charlotte was 40 minutes late and went to the wrong gate, giving myself and other passengers 15 minutes to get off the plane and run across the airport to the opposite side, only to miss my flight. Though the plane was still there, since it was less than 10 minutes, the doors were shut and that was that. The attendants at the gate were rude and cut me off midsentence. I will never fly with them again. ",0
"Brussels to Beijing return. My first time to use Hainan airlines and I am very impressed by their business class. I had a quiet single window seat which is a nice full flat bed when reclined. Bedding and amenities very good quality, and staff looked after every wish of mine with effective service. Food was better from Brussels than on my return, and they have a chef in the cabin which impressed me. Very nice lounge in Beijing and enjoyed nice dinner here. I was not expecting such a high standard for Chinese air carrier, and will certainly choose to fly them again.",1
"We flew on 23rd November out of Adelaide with Qatar and the experience was absolutely wonderful. The staff were so helpful, we had loads of space, brilliant onboard entertainment and enjoyed the whole flight. Food was really good, and excellent choices, when I had my nighttime nip of whiskey they gave me a large measure and made a special trip to see if I wanted another drink. The plane was fairly quiet so after take of the staff assisted all in spreading out and getting a row each to make it comfortable. I will only fly Qatar now out of Adelaide. I personally would like to thank Qatar Airways for continuing to support Australia even when our national carrier stopped all international flights, it was the only real option to fly out of Adelaide.",1
"Thank goodness I never need to fly Air NZ again! Absolutely no sense of urgency, both international flights were over 30 mins late. The first flight was so late we missed our connection. Pilots and attendants do not communicate the reason we sit and sit and sit at the gate. Kiwi people may be laid back but this is not a good quality in an airline! If you have connecting flights you are toast! Do not recommend! Sitting so long at the gate I have time to write this!!",0
Munich to Vancouver. My 6 foot frame was squashed into a space suitable for a child for a 9.5 hour transatlantic flight. There were no personal air vents. Terrible decline in what was a quality airline a few years ago.,0
Frankfurt to Washington Dulles on Jan 8 flight LH418. Return on Jan 10th flight LH419. I have been flying Lufthansa for many years now both professionally and privately. It is not a cheap airline but I admit that I still use it for my private trips because of the impeccable quality of service at all levels. As a Senator passenger I know I get more perks but I see all the time the genuine attention that the staff puts in when dealing with every passenger. After having delt for many years with numerous american airlines I find this very refreshing!,1
Staff indifferent and rude. We had a 4 hour delay from Kona to Portland and they offered no inflight freebies to compensate. Going to Maui they kept serving alcohol to passengers that were drunk.,0
We flew with our 7 year old daughter from London Gatwick to Toronto on January 10 2013. This was the last leg of our World Trip and we had travelled on 9 different airlines as we travelled around the world and were now heading home on a Canadian carrier. Terrible! That is the word to describe the rude service of the staff on board. The airline claims it was voted as the number one Leisure Airline in the world. How can that be? They charge you for everything on board and when you ask for something the first thing they tell you is that there will be a cost involved. Enough already! We know just sell me the item I ask for. I will never fly with them again.,0
I recently had a trip to Kansas City from Albany. The experience was horrible. I suffer from a panic disorder. So I decided to take a leap of faith and take this trip. My flight was delayed by 2 hours with an email the night before at 10pm when i was due to travel at 530am. When i landed on Detroit i was told my 2nd flight was already gone. So i was stuck there for 3 hours. Then they finally found me a flight from Detroit to Minnesota. Then i had to wait 7 hours at the Minnesota airport for my next flight to Kansas. The people were rude and not very verbal. No sense of compassion. I will never travel through them again specially in my condition.,0
"Melbourne to New York via Los Angeles return with United Airlines. Seats very uncomfortable. Staff very rude and seemed to have little first aid training. We flew on 4 flights during which there were 3 medical emergencies. My daughter is a nurse and attended to passengers on each occasion. Staff had little first aid training, supplies were minimal, equipment were faulty. The food was disgusting and there was a lack of it for a long international flight. Return flight to Melbourne flight was overbooked, we could not sit together. I would never fly this airline again.",0
"A wonderful travel experience with Qantas from boarding the plane to arrival in Singapore. Although we had a slight delay when departing Melbourne, we were well informed. All staff were extremely friendly and helpful. Qantas business class seats comfortable with plenty of space. Best of all, was the food, with amazing flavours and selections.",1
"American Airlines made us wait three days in Mexico due to a blizzard. Completely understand, but the connection flight from Cancun through Miami was impossible to connect if you were sat on the second half of the airplane. My family ran since we got of the airplane and we were 8 minutes before flight departure to the gate and they would not let us in, the gate closed 10 minutes before departure. We were 2 minutes late to gate closure. They were late on departing to Miami and they could not even wait a few minutes to close the connecting gate to San Francisco Horrible!, not traveling with them again.",0
"Flew Frontier Airlines from Tampa to Islip, New York. Worst airline ever. They stopped my friend and I from boarding the flight before it was even supposed to board, terrible customer service. All the staff were rude and not helpful, wasted our money for nothing.",0
Melbourne to Abu Dhabi with Etihad. Entertainment system not working so my 6 year old had a rough time on a 13 hour flight. The worst part was that upon complaint they were willing to offer my 6 year old another seat and with some stranger completely unsupervised. Probably the worst flight and post flight feedback experience ever. Very poor.,0
"Flight delayed for nearly two hours, staff are rude aggressive and unhelpful. Missed Airbnb check in because of delay, which means I'll be sleeping at the airport and losing 1300 pesos. Worst airline I've ever used. Avoid Volaris",0
"Horrible, costly experience. I was running late and the agent told me that they will close the gate 10 minutes before departure. I arrived 12 minutes before departure due to a long security line. The pretty girl standing in front of me got on the plane but they would not let me on. The only explanation I have received is that the pilot wanted to push early. Unbelievable! But sadly true. I am epically disappointed in WestJet Airlines today, they rescheduled me landing in BC, way too late for my needs.",0
Flight 352 and 353 from Manchester to Varadero. I was dreading this long haul flight with TC after reading all bad reviews but we really had a pleasant journey with this company. Cabin was nice felt not cramped at all and the seats where comfortable although we paid extra to have more leg room . Entertainment on board was ok food nice and the crew very professional . I flew long haul with other companies eg virgin atlantic and I have to say TC is miles better. I will definitely fly Thomas Cook again.,1
"I booked from Dubai to Kuala Lampur via Riyadh, after check in the flight was suddenly cancelled, later their excuse was bad weather, there definitely was not bad weather, I checked myself. I was rebooked via Jeddah, flight arrived very late, I missed my appointment, Saudi airlines compensated me 98AED only, absolutely a disaster.",0
"Memphis to Phoenix. This airline does not know how customer service should be. I have 500k miles with them and at gold level. They still treat their business clients like dirt and the agents are rude in talking with customer. I will sell off my miles and start other airlines with thoughts ""what have done for today"" otherwise I don't use you for traveling. Beware they keep changing the program so you are never at the top level or even treated like a customer should be. I think the public need to reverse the tables on companies like this and stop doing business with them",0
Delhi to Paris via Kuwait. A320 was not comfortable while Boeing 777 was comfortable but the airport layover at Kuwait was really negative experience. Washrooms are filthy and behaviour of security staff is rude and they are disorganized. Overall the environment is cold on the airport seems like a shut down shopping mall and layover is not recommended. You can opt for this airline if they are not transiting through Kuwait otherwise not recommended at all.,0
"They cancelled a flight, I requested a voucher in Oct. 2020, and it is May 2021 and I am still waiting. I contacted them per email, and on Twitter, and I have yet to see my voucher. They have promised to issue it several times, but they just want to keep customers' money. So I am back to travelling with Ryanair, because although their service could improve a lot, at least they are honest and upfront about every single expense.",0
"Chicago to Dallas. I am writing this review to counteract the bad ones. We had no problems flying from O'hare to DFW and back. In fact, the aisles are wider and I had more leg room than on other airlines because I sat in the emergency row. No one likes fees and free pretzels would have been nice but I survived. The service was comparable to United or Delta. Pleasant and nice. In fact, our flight arrived early at the destination and the terminal was still full from another plane. There was around a 10 minute delay because they let 4 people on the plane late! Wow! I am applying for a credit card which gives you a free flight from the beginning. I'm not sure if we got really lucky but would fly again. Maybe the new CEO is turning everything around.",1
TAM airlines is the only form of transportation I have come across in Brasil that is on time. I was impressed when I checked in and was transferred to an earlier flight that was already boarding. I was impressed at the efficiency. I boarded the earlier flight and was surprised that my luggage came on the same flight. They also had an English speaker so I didn't have to struggle with my Portuguese in explaining the situation. ,1
"A couple of days before leaving for Florida, got an email from Edelweiss offering an upgrade to Business for cash. Less than an hour later I called and booked the upgrade for my wife and I. A short while later got another email from them, telling me there were no upgrades available! Terrible customer service.",0
"Spokane to Salt Lake City via Albuquerque. Delta left us stranded at 9pm. I was with a minor child. Delta offered no compensation for food or hotel. We missed our connecting flight after being delayed due to fire smoke. They only offered to put us on a flight the next day. Delta said they only offer vouchers, if the delay's are weather related. Fire smoke in the air, should be considered weather related. Delta lost my business for good.",0
"Penang to Copenhagen via Doha. Great flights. Staff attentive and friendly. Nice with printed menu cards in economy. Good wines, drinks and responsive IFE system. Super to receive amenity kit with lip balm etc. Would definitely fly again!",1
"Paid full fare business class, was denied entry to the lounge despite it being included in the fare, also included and not delivered was catering and priority boarding, I got to the gate and she roped off the priority queue in front of me, showed her my ticket, she pointed to the back of the economy line and turned around. I said I'm flying business and she looked at the ticket, said ""too late, should have got here earlier"", she then proceeded to let 4 groups of people down the priority lane after I walked away, all of whom I later saw flying business class just like me. Seat was wet, covered in wine, sauce and stains, cabin full, 'nothing they can do', spent the flight uncomfortably on 2 jackets. Catering was non existent, no service, attendants ignored call bell when I tried to get a drink, went to the crew to ask in the galley, was told to ""go away, you cant be here"". Flight attendants proceeded to sit together as a group of 3 laughing the entire flight and taking selfies. Toilets were disgusting, not cleaned once, piss and toilet paper everywhere, never felt like I needed a shower more than when I was on that flight.",0
Qantas have to be the worst airline I have ever flown with. Paying a premium fee for a substandard service. Our flights were booked 7 months in advance and cancelled two weeks prior to departure via email. No options given just a notification of the flight we have been moved to 48 hours later. 4 hours on hold to speak with the most useless customer service team to attempt rebook another flight. Qantas could not accommodate with affiliate airlines that they have advertised and sold on their website as we needed to arrive on the same day we had to have an extra 6 hours in transit. We paid an additional fee to have a bassinet seat and was told that they this would not be available on our rebooked flight.,0
"Victoria to Calgary. The customer service was nowhere to be found, the phone support was rude and unhelpful. They cancelled my flight with no compensation and didn't even bother to look for other airlines to provide alternative. Getting support was a nightmare and they were unhelpful and rude.",0
"Guangzhou to New York. Cabin is spacious and neat. The trip back was full and I couldn't get a seat next to my parents since I picked our seats at the counter. The crew arranged a crew seat for me behind my parents. Meals were okay, it's mostly Chinese cuisine. Movies were not up to date, they were  the same as I flown to CAN. Other services were pretty good. Crews were friendly and talkative.",1
Travelled with Monarch from Dalaman 18 June 2013 to Leeds Bradford Flight number ZB7535 and vice versa 8 June flight ZB7534. Excellent plane very clean and modern. Staff really good. Well informed. Everything we needed. Comfortable. Only negative was too many kids running round as plane half empty was a real nuisance and not relaxing.,1
Ahmedabad to Delhi. I had booked Vistara flight because had heard a lot about them and was the first time I flew them and felt great to be given a luxury treatment and service on a domestic flight. I flew premium economy and was surprised that even on a 320 they manage to seperate the cabins and also served welcome drinks and the efficient boarding and deboarding. Priorirty tagged and received quicker too. Overall such a great airline to fly with.,1
"Thai Airways did better than this last time. I have asked cabin crew for window seat because the check in staff did mentioned to check with the crew, after I have spoken to one of the lady crew she promised that she will get back to me but nothing was said. Another male cabin crew was supposed to pass my bf the chicken rice, after the food was served my bf waited for a long time until another side of the crew was asking and passed to my bf instead. He did not apologise and ignored at least for any follow up and empathy for passengers. This is no customer service and low quality of cabin crew.",0
"I booked a flight through Delta in October 2020 to travel to Amsterdam, Netherlands. When I booked the flight I was told to contact KLM to request a bassinet seat since I was traveling with my infant and I would be flying with KLM. I contacted KLM and was assigned economy seats for the flight to Amsterdam. I was also provided with the seat assignments in economy comfort for the return flight to New York. In October KLM informed me that I would need to pay for my husband's seat on the return flight as it was economy comfort and I made that payment. I was not informed at that time that I also needed to pay for my seat assignment. When I arrived at the airport in January for the return flight to New York and checked my bags I was told that I needed to pay 100 euros for my seat, at that time I had no opportunity to then change my seat assignment because that was the only bassinet seat available so I paid the 100 euros. KLM did not inform me about payment for a seat that I was assigned to and then I had no choice but to pay for the seat assignment because I was already at the airport checking in for my flight. I should have been informed in October when I was told that I needed to pay for my husband's seat assignment. I contacted KLM when I returned to NY and they responded weeks later stated that I could not be reimbursed because I wanted to sit next to my husband? My complaint was never understood and they only apologized for taking two weeks to respond to me. They also stated that ""Fares are dynamic in nature and not guaranteed. They may change quickly depending on various factors like the period of travel, seats availability, the destination, as well as the number of passengers trying to book that particular fare at the same time. The fares may increase or decrease as per the availability."" Fares increase and decrease before purchasing a flight and if there was a change in the cost of my flight I would have been notified. This experience is very disappointing since the KLM staff at the airport and on the airline were great but the customer service before and after have guaranteed that I would not fly with KLM in the future.",0
"I am very disappointed with TAP service. It's the worst that I have ever experienced. I bought my ticket in January and canceled the same day. I read that if you cancel within 24 hours the full refund will be issued. So I canceled. I did not recieve any cancelation proof, any document, any email. I called TAP Twice in both cases I waited 20 minutes for someone to talk with. I was informed that I will receive the refund within 30 days! Long but ok, I had to trust. I waited 30 days but the money did not appear on my paypal account, I gave TAP 6 days more and today I called again. After waiting 20 minutes someone picked up the phone and informed me that it's not 30 calendar days, it's business days! Never again with TAP.",0
"Budapest to Copenhagen. Ryanair supply the worst service when they cancel a flight. They refuse to rebook you on an alternative route, but if you pressure them they will allow you to book yourself. They will however later then refuse to reimburse you the cost of the alternative tickets even they have to according to EU regulation. Worst part is that they know they are doing something wrong. When you keep fighting they will eventually pay you, but not before you spend a lot of time arguing with their terrible customer service.",0
We will never fly with this airline again. Flight out of Moline Il was delayed for an hour because the airplane wasn't there. We finally get a plane and find out from the flight attendant the delay was caused because there was no ramp at their last stop. The pilots did an awesome job getting us to Dallas on time. But then we sat for over an hour waiting to get to a gate. By this time everyone's connecting flights should have left. But we run across the Dallas airport and find out our connecting flight is delayed as well. Seems we didn't have a crew. What a joke. Never again.,0
While at Singapore Changi Airport it took me more than 2.5 hrs to queue just to check in. The AirAsia counters were grossly under staffed with 2 to 3 staff members frantically trying to process up to 4 or 5 flights of passengers. There was not enough staff to manage the queue many passengers were fed up and started queue jumping. Many passengers were late to board the plane not to mention time to shop the DFS stores. My flight to Bali took off an hour late. Worst experience I had with a budget airline.,0
"2.5 hours waiting in line for the customer service desk for United Airlines, becuase my earlier flight was canceled because of ""bad weather"". I finally got to the desk to be told I would have too wait another 25 hours. I am currently waiting and I am on standby. I will not be traveling with United again.",0
Luton to Larnaca. As Wizz Air customer service told me that the system is trying to seat families together but make the check in ASAP I woke up and done the check in exactly 48 hours before departure hoping to get seats together as buying them would be a rip off. So I checked in and me and my daughter are seating in one place while my husband is seated on a different place and there are many 3 seats together available. Also they made sure the seat next to us was taken so we can't buy only one seat. Also buying extra luggage is so expensive for this flight and we had to rely on the tiny carry on bag. Soon we will have to pay for that as well. So this is not a low cost company anymore. I'm very upset.,0
Baltimore to Tampa. I had surgery 6 days prior and had medical documentation stating I was not to lift anything over 2 pounds or walk extended distances. I was not even supposed to fly but I was going to see a specialist on Maryland so the restrictions were put in place and we arranged wheelchair assistance. I had zero issues the flight to BWI. The trip back was an absolute nightmare and completely unacceptable. We landed in Tampa after a turbulent flight which in turn heightened my pain. I was 1 of 5 people that had boarded with wheelchair assistance. When we landed we were advised that the wheelchairs weren't available yet. Fortunately the other 4 people were able to walk off the aircraft without a problem. I advised the stewardess of my restrictions and stated I would wait. Everyone had gotten off and the stewardess asked me to walk off. I again told her I could not. They cleaned the plane a bit and again told me I needed to get off. I did not fight it and advised them I could not lift my bag and they carried it off for me and had me stand in pain in the alleyway and wait with the entire crew. She then said I needed to go so I slowly started walking and walked most the alley way where I was then greeted with a wheelchair. The attendant then took off hitting the bump off the gate. I told him I just had surgery but clearly he was in a hurry. This is absolutely unacceptable. I legitimately needed help and had arranged for assistance on advance with documentation stating my restrictions. If there weren't any wheelchairs available I should not have been forced to walk in pain when I was advised by a medical professional otherwise. I had physical proof with me and this trip was not made by choice. I called and filed a complaint with customer service and was advised I would get a response within 10 days. This is unacceptable! My husband and I have always flown Southwest and never had an issue.,0
Arrived at Calgary Airport only to find out our plane which was coming out of Denver was delayed over two hours due to weather. This will put us in Chicago too late to make our connection. This means we cannot fly out till the next morning. United will not give us a voucher for anything because the delay was not 4 or more hrs. I looked at Denver weather radar and there is no bad weather. Gate people keep saying bad weather. Maybe there was down the line but not in Denver as they are insisting. So they don't have to supply vouchers for this late leg. The week prior I was booked on flight out of Houston. They had to change equipment then we were told it would take a few minutes to do the 'paperwork'. Two hrs later they finally finished. I like being informed and being told the truth. Will not fly United anymore.,0
"American Airlines sold me a ticket at the counter for a flight that I did not have enough time to board. My bags went and the gate had closed. As instructed by an AA customer service representative, I purchased another ticket and filed for a refund. AA is declining to give me a refund! Absolutely ridiculous. I never want to fly with AA again. It was their mistake and should fix it accordingly. I would not recommend this airline to anyone! Terrible customer service.",0
"Sydney to Hobart with Virgin Australia. By far the worst Australian airline. We flew with them on our holiday to Tasmania earlier this year and the experience wasn't worth the price. Lack of staff at check in counters and an unexplained 45 minute delay. No apology was given to us at the end. To make matters worse, the plane was very old and dirty. I found packets from the previous flight in my seat pocket. Call button was repeatedly rejected and I was dying of thirst in the dry cabin. Legroom was minimal and seats were worn out and lumpy. We landed in Hobart tired from a 2 hour inflight nightmare.",0
Toronto to Fort Lauderdale. Return from Fort Lauderdale to Ottawa. As many have said cramped. Rouge is overpriced. Reminded me of cheap flights UK to Spain 25 years ago. Yet for what one gets Rouge is not a cheap option. But at least the crew got us there and with a soft landing.,0
Denver to Orlanda. The seats were horribly uncomfortable and the food was  overpriced. I will not recommend this airline for overnight or long flight. I traveled with my 14 year old son and even he found the airline was substandard. Frontier used to be my favorite airline but unfortunately they have gone downhill.,0
"I have been ripped off in front of hundreds of people. My weekend trip to London ended up with a surprise at the airport.  The flight was delayed cause of fog in LTN. Thats fine. During slow and painful boarding I was stopped at the counter to check either my hand luggage fits the metal cage. I was completely shocked, then service agent turned around the normal standard luggage side fitter to tiny hole on the other side. My hand lugage did not fit in matter of milimetres. I had to pay 30 pounds or either 50euros. Shame on Wizz Air. No more flights with you.",0
"Rome to Sydney via Doha in May. For the return two sectors Qatar Airways did not credit miles to my Qantas frequent flyer account claiming I didn't travel business class on the sectors, and the miles were credited to another account. Mileage for the outbound sectors were credited to my Qantas account. After the refusal to credit the miles, I wrote twice to their Customer Care, providing copies of all documents, and my letters were unanswered. My travel agent also provided the documents to the Sydney QR representative and she did nothing. I found the entire experience unsatisfactory.",0
"Gatwick to Paphos. Chaos at check in as another system failure. Leg room was shocking for a 4 hour flight. Definately a low cost airline now. No food, drink, IFE and paying for luggage. Long haul BA has barely maintained its standards but short haul British Airways has become a disgrace.",0
Sydney to Auckland. Just the worst airline. Every time I fly with them they are delayed and they seem to have every reason that its not their fault. Truly the worst national carrier. If you can avoid them.,0
"The worst airline by far and this is coming from someone who has been around the world several times. As I write this, been stuck for 4 hours on the ground in a small airport in Montrose, CO because they could not get a hold of their mechanic to solve a trivial issue. Restaurant is closed, snack bar is closed, many families stranded here for hours and American has not offered one person a bottle of water. Disgusting company that only cares about themselves, never again.",0
Dallas to Las Vegas. Horrible customer service. They cancelled our flight and offered us no compensation whatsoever. No meal no hotel stay not even a discounted room rate or flight discount. If you would like to be told to wait in an airport for 14 hours this airline is for you.,0
Gatwick to Rome. Vueling staff just disappeared. We were sent to a gate in Gatwick airport and nobody from the airline ever showed up. It's been almost 2 hours and we are all still waiting. I will never fly with them again.,0
SEN to EDI 22nd July out 25th back. This airline just gets better and better. Boarding fine both ways. The friendliest cabin crew both ways who did really well to serve the full flight going despite short flight time. The captain was the same both ways who even came out of the cockpit both ways to say good bye. Now almost as good as a full fare airline.,1
"Denver to Baltimore via Chicago. Bucket seats with no padding and horrible customer service. Offered us little options or compensation when they flew us into Chicago and told us we would be stranded there for at least 24 hours. However, the next flight was also out in the evening and would likely be cancelled as well. If they had informed us before we boarded our first flight, we could have stayed happily in Denver. Instead, we had to pay hundreds of dollars to get home from Chicago, and then Spirit only offered to refund us their supposed cost of the second leg of the flight, a quarter of what we paid. I was skeptical when my partner scheduled us flying with them and I will never fly Spirit again after this horrific experience.",0
Booked to fly Sydney to BA 1pm Tuesday it's now Friday and I've made it as far as Auckland. We sat all day at the gate in SYD eventually told flight cancelled due to mechanical problem. After spending 2 nights we left SYD last night only to land in Auckland for 16 hour layover due to crew shortages. No communication other than rumours from hotel staff. Airline had paid for accommodation and meals but very basic. No entertainment onboard other. Due to fly out 10pm tonight. Traveller beware.,0
"I had my first trip with Cathay Pacific from Seoul to London via Hong Kong and I am so impressed. Both the plane and the staff was exellent. I have never been offered better service on economy class. Very good food, even menu choice. Extremely kind and professional staff, hard working for us. The entertainment offer on the screen was also impressive. Even though we had some delays due to a sick passanger, I was happy with my choice. And they offered the cheapest tickets I could find.",1
"My boyfriend and I got up at 5 am this morning to make our 8am flight to Orlando from Detroit. It is now 3.45pm and I'm still sitting at the gate. They have given us updates every 2 hours or so saying that a new pilot is on his way from Pittsburgh with no explanation as to why a new pilot was needed in the first place. They've lied and said he was only an hour away for 5 hours! As an apology they gave us food vouchers worth 7 dollars, which helped a lot with the 85 dollar bill I got from TGI fridays! I've had a lot of bad experiences flying Spirit, but this will be my last.",0
"No particular problem. Flight on time. Nice crew. Good organisation despite the situation. Please keep this way of disembarking the passengers rank after rank. It's so easier, quieter, and eventually faster than usually when everybody try to rush out at the same time.",1
Bloomington to Cincinnati with Allegiant. Just horrible. Waited through a 4 hour delay for a 1.5 hour flight with very slow and limited information. Evidently Allegiant has 1 plane as we waited for the 1 to show up. This is an airline totally unconcerned about their customers showing a poor attitude. Do not use this airline.,0
"Our Eurowings flight from Vienna to Stansted was cancelled after a 6 hour wait. We were rebooked onto a flight 24 hours later and our luggage was kept by the airline. 'We' includes my 2 year old and 6 month old sons. When we arrived the next day at the airport, after another 2.5 hour delay we flew, our suitcases did not. It took 2 days for us to get our suitcases delivered and that was this evening. Only one of the suitcases was ours. Eurowings continue to refuse to help in any way and say they will only get involved 5 days after the suitcases go missing. Our holiday is only 6 days long and it was for my mum's 60th. We didn't have her presents for the day, I don't have my babies eczema cream or any of the home comforts that my children need. ",0
"Kuala Lumpur to Singapore with Malaysia Airlines. Stay away! There is absolutely no reason for one to pay for such a rude and impolite experience. This airline should have been bust multiple times already. As a weekly traveller I never in my life experienced such a rude, lazy and ufriendly staff. They should be deeply ashamed. Besides that maintenance of the cabins is zero. Everything is dirty and old. On all their routes there are more than enough alternatives.",0
"I traveled for business with Lufthansa from London in the UK to Graz in Austria over the summer. Upon my return, Lufthansa canceled my connecting flight to Munich. They did not offer any rerouting, were not reachable by email or phone and lost my time and over 600 EUR since I needed to rebook on my own and to spent an additional night in Graz. It was an altogether horrific journey since I was pregnant. In correspondence I've had subsequently with Lufthansa trying to invoke my passenger's rights under the EU Passenger Rights regulation, Lufthansa's customer service was disrespectful and rude. No refund was issued.",0
"Dortmund to Luton. This was the last time I used Easyjet. I don't care if I need to pay double the price for a ticket. I passed the check in Dortmund airport, head to my gate and waited to board. I had a luggage and a backpack as I had my suit in my hand luggage and didn't want to ruin my suit. My two bags were less than 8Kg so there was enough space to combine them in one. Easyjet's employee told me in a very rude way that I need to put everything in one luggage and told me ""you get what you pay for"". Of course I put everything in one bag but Easyjet should have in mind that it doesn't do as a favor when we pick it as a flight service provider.",0
"This flight was unbearably cold, staff had no blankets to hand out, they claimed there were working on making the temp not so bad but nothing happened, I sat for 3 hours grinding my teeth from shivering it was so cold. I will not be flying Delta ever again.",0
"All flights delayed some due to weather others to ""no staff for flight crew"". Missed all connection flights. Help desk staff extremely rude and condescending especially in JFK. Will never ever fly this airline again. Info given by crew 10 min before landing late regarding new gate and terminal incorrect.",0
"I have flown with China Southern Airlines many times from Australia to different cities in mainland China, and back to Australia over the past 6 years and have found it second to none. The flight attendants efforts to please and provide comforts to you do make you feel a bit special. My latest flight in Business Class from Brisbane to Guangzhou was a very enjoyable trip, as was the previous flight to Brisbane in November 2015. I thank the flight attendants for an enjoyable trip, and ground staff for their help and guidance on transfers. ",1
"The worst airline ever. Once before I decided not to use this airline but I gave them another chance, but it was just to reassuring not used this airline ever again.",0
"Be very careful with AirAsia, we booked an flight and after once changing our timings from Air Asia they just canceled our flight. We have to book another airline to get to our vacation, of course much more expensive. There was flights from AirAsia available but they didn't offer us. So now they are not paying the money back, they hold it on the air Asia credit account. I try to get my money back but AirAsia refuse to pay back.",0
"I took a round trip flight from Rome to Miami. The flights were the worst in terms of seat comfort and food. The so called ""head rest"" of the seat has made the flights very uncomfortable. The legroom was very short and on top of that there was a metal box on the floor occupying my foot room. I have never seen anything like this before! I will never take an Alitalia flight again!",0
Wonderful customer service. The customer service staff who serviced flight Delta 2414 from Las Vegas to Seattle on 22 June 2017 was amazing. This gentleman was polite and professional and was absolutely funny. I was also amazed that the pilot who was standing at the counter also spoke and joked with customers waiting for seat allocation. This is very refreshing and cool. The special treatment continued on the flight with very friendly flight attendants. The snacks provided on this domestic flight is better than what you get on a premium airline in Australia. I am very impressed with the service from all levels. Keep up the good work Delta. My family and I will definitely fly with Delta again.,1
Volaris airline never called or emailed telling us that our flight was cancelled and changed for to days later. There was no voucher or reimbursement. No help in customer service for Volaris which wont answer there calls. If I could give this a zero I would.,0
"Salt Lake City to Denver. I had an amazing experience with Frontier Airlines. I am military and was able to change my flight at last minute notice and the supervisor, check in attendants, and flight attendants were very helpful and friendly.  I will recommend Frontier to friends and family.",1
"Santa Cruz to Uyuni via La Paz. For the entire time of the flight, no flight attendants could be reached. The flight attendant alert button worked, but no one would respond. I walked the economy section of the plane to find that flight attendants were asleep! The service on the flight was unacceptable. The food gross, and the cabin quality terrible.",0
We flew London to Quebec via Montreal and poor service began before we boarded the flight. We checked in online selected our seats printed our boarding passes checked our luggage in and when we got to the gate they told us we could no longer sit in our allocated seats. We specifically requested the seats as we were travelling with an infant. On the plane the seats are cramped the cabin staff generally unhelpful and rude insisting we take our full meal service even though we had an infant on our lap. As it was it didn't matter as the food was of a very poor standard. The inflight entertainment system clunky and limited choice the touch screen system not working effectively meant passengers behind constantly banging the screens and your seats trying to get the system to work. No seat belts are provided for infants either for take off or landing. This is an airline that seems to be operating a decade behind most others. I will never fly with them again. The trip from Montreal to Quebec was even worse but found out later it was not AC but Jazz.,0
"Melbourne to Manila in February 2018, great service, good food and selection of beverages. Very polite and professional flight attendants, can't understand why some people's comments are so harsh.",1
"I would never fly Swoop again. They will change your flights to completely different times and dates with only 2 weeks notice at best, and they won't compensate you in any way. Sometimes they change your flights the day before. They explain that it is a schedule change, not a cancellation, and therefore you're not entitles to any compensation. They won't book you onto WestJet or any of their affiliates, so don't count on that. If you get anything back it's in Swoop credits only, so you have to deal with that nightmare all over again. Friends had their flight delayed 9 hours with 3 hours notice and got compensated, after 3 weeks of arguing, in credits they'll never use. Also their apps and system constantly crash. We were stranded at the airport once because they changed our flight last minute and we couldn't load the new boarding pass. Of course their check in terminals were closed because they bumped our flight up an hour and now we were 'late', so we were considered to be the ones in the wrong even though they changed our flight.",0
"Cusco to Lima. Worst airline ever. Before we even arrived in Peru they changed our flights twice, as much as a day so our whole tour was effected. Today our flight was cancelled and only option given was later tonight so we missed our connection to Iquitos which affects our Iquitos hotel Booking and Amazon tour. They offered free lunch and hotel. The hotel we couldnt arrange until lining up in Lima airport al over again. Zero information. We have had to book another airline for 6 people so we can make our Amazon tour. Absolutely furious!",0
"Tokyo Narita to Newark with United Airlines. Terrible service, had no blankets in the seat, ask the stewardess for one and received a reply of ""don't you have one in your seat already?"" said no and she insisted that I had one, was told to wait. 3 hours later still no blanket, had to talk to another stewardess for one, took 5 mins. That's pretty lousy for a 12 hours flight. Only had one option of food. ",0
"We booked and paid for our Jetstar Airways flights from Bali to Melbourne, direct flights. Two hours before check in, I get an email saying the flight has been cancelled because of engineering requirements. We had to re book our flights at a later date, and the best we could get was Bali to Brisbane and then Brisbane to Melbourne. That's ok, what I'm not ok with is been charged extra money by Jetstar for a 4 hour longer flight and being offered zero compensation. A joke of a company with terrible customer service.",0
"I travelled by Etihad Airways on 1st September from Lahore to Toronto. I had 2 stopovers, Abu Dhabi and Dublin. When I reached Toronto, one of my bags was missing. Since then despite sending repeated emails,making phone calls, at first Etihad didnt respond. Etihad had code sharing with PIA and Air Canada. When finally they responded, they said it was not their responsibility and put blame on Air Canada. They said they have closed the case from their side. How can they close the case like that? My whole bag of 23 kilos is gone they think it is a joke, not ready to compensate. It is a very devastating and demoralising situation.",0
"Air Canada Rouge is a service that should be eliminated. I paid for a preferred seat on a flight from Toronto Ontario to Liberia Costa. The seat was cramped and I am average weight at 5'7"". There are only 3 sandwich offerings of which they ran out of one before the flight was a third complete. If you need to use the toilet facilities it is difficult as the carts were frequently in the aisles blocking the access to the only bathrooms at the rear of the plane. When I asked if I could use the toilet in the Premium section I was told I had to wait until the beverage service was complete in my section. When the attendant was not looking I used the Premium toilets. The fact that you must use your own devices to watch movies is the biggest money extraction ploy. There were no plugs to recharge devices. Staff were pleasant but working in difficult circumstances. Never will I use this service again.",0
"Cleveland to Denver. Horrible experience, they cancelled our flight at the last minute because of ""crew availability"" which cost us a lot of money since we had to find a same day flight. We spent over 2 hours on the phone with them trying to get us on another flight, worst experience I have ever had with an airline. Will not ever be flying with Frontier Airlines again no matter how much cheaper it is at the time because you will pay for it later.",0
"Terrible airline! Delayed for over 7 hours with no respect of time to recourse. Boarded the plane and waited another 1.5 before we left from the gate! Terrible, terrible, terrible.",0
"I have flown Southwest Airlines my whole life. I have to say they have been great up until this year. Over the course of 20 flights, 7 have been canceled and 8 have been delayed. I am on a plane today for a 47 minute flight that is delayed because a suitcase machine broke. I mean come on. It is time all airlines are held responsible for this ridiculous service.",0
My wife and I flew first class from Fort Lauderdale to La Guardia on October 27 2014. What a pleasantry that experience was. We flew first class and was extremely pleased with the service and with the attendants courteous manners. The meal we had was hot the drinks were served promptly and we were always asked if there was anything else they could do to ensure us a pleasant flight and comfort.,1
"I was seated in the front row of Premium Economy on Singapore Airlines A380 service from Auckland to Singapore. Being the first row, it has extra leg space. The PE seat is upholstered in leather and had a good recline. AC socket, USB port were available in each seat. For each of the two meals served on this route, there was a choice of 3 main courses on the menu. During the 10 hour flight, flight attendants came around often to offer drinks at regular intervals. In between meals, there was a snack service with a choice of fruits, sandwiches and chips. The selection of movies and music for inflight entertainment is extensive and probably one of the best if not the best. Noise cancelling headphones are provided for best acoustic effect. As always, Singapore Airlines maintains a high level of inflight service and this flight is no different.",1
"Abbotsford to Hamilton. My bag was broken upon arrival to YHM, september 17th 2019. I informed a staff member of Swoop, she then took pictures of my bag and the baggage tag and said she would email me later for a damaged bag claim, that she was too busy to file it right then and there. One week had gone by and I heard nothing Sept. 24th 2019 I was traveling back to YXX told the check in agent that my bag was broken upon arrival and that I wanted to fill out paperwork, she advised me to contact the head office, it is now Oct. 2nd I have done all the running around and jumping through hoops for them, sending them pictures of the damage to my bag etc. Called the head office and having to return the next day to YXX an hour from my home a two hour road trip that could have been avoided if someone would have just done their job in the first place. This company gives you the run around hoping you will just get tired of the chase, and let them be.",0
Flew from Melbourne to Los Angeles. Seat extremely comfortable and reclined into fully flat bed. They give you a mattress that smoothes out any lumps and bumps in the seat. I was able to get about 7 hours sleep. There was so much legroom I could stretch my legs out as far as possible without hitting anything in front of me. The staff were relaxed yet professional. The lounge was a great place to talk to the people you are travelling with. The sleeper suit was very comfortable and the items in the amenity kit provided an excellent experience. The food was what you would expect in first class. Qantas will be my first option when I travel.,1
"My daughter and I flew from London to Athens yesterday. We both had a backpack for our laptops, which we went to London with from Athens, but on the way back we have to pay 100 pounds for our backpacks. I am very upset and the rude Heathrow staff behavior with customers at the gate, and I will never recommend this airline.",0
"Gold Coast to Melbourne. This is the worst Airline I have ever seen. Horrible customer care, rude. Would not recommend this company to anyone.",0
We flew from LHR to Brussels and back on a reward flight which was very pleasant even though it was a quick hop across the channel! Just about had time to enjoy the cream tea on the outbound flight. Quality of the tea drink was the best I've tasted in the sky. The champagne was very nice too. Business lounge at Brussels was very pleasant and is to be recommended.,1
"Destin to Indianapolis. No problems whatsoever with this airline. A lot of bad reviews online but this was the first time I have ever flown commercial and it was flawless. Boarding passes were easy from my phone, gate check in was smooth and quick, and flight departed on time and arrived on time. I had flown privately many times with my company but this was my first commercial flight and I was very satisfied for the price I paid. I will definitely fly with Allegiant Air in the future.",1
"Air India are absolute hopeless. I was travelling Melbourne to Hyderabad via Delhi with my 4 month old son. We were told that the bassinet was confirmed at the time of booking the ticket, but did not get one and when I asked the flight attendant was very rude. Didn't even provide me with water for the baby food, I had to get water myself from the galley area every time. They absolutely don't care. The worst airline crew.",0
Bristol to Hamburg. vastly overpriced for what you get. Decided to use an alternative route and carrier.,0
"Newark to Seattle. I fly United every alternate week and its a bad airline. Their quality is complete ripoff. I travel because United has better connection and other airports are way too far. Given an option, will switch to American Airlines. The seat size, seat space is like they are transporting furniture.",0
"Their online system appears to have a massive defect which would cause a tremendous issue. After issuing the reservation that I have provided documentation of, I received a note that appeared to be a scam, claiming my credit card had not approved the charge for the flights I had received confirmation of. Checking my credit card statement, I was charged for the tickets. When contacting Austrian, they stated that having not been paid their system canceled my flights without notifying me. However, their agent then confirmed they had indeed billed my card and their charge was in fact being held against my card. Their agent admitted that they were utterly befuddled by the numerous errors within their system, the error in cancelling my flights, the error in stating they had not been paid, the error in not notifying me of a cancellation, etc. Essentially, she was polite, but could not sort out any reason for the numerous mistakes Austrian had made. I have blocked payment to Austrian and booked another airline as I cannot risk failing to reach Vienna for a business meeting. This should serve as a cautionary tale to check, verify, investigate, and take any other action possible to ensure Austrian has not failed spectacularly in what should be a trivial business transaction.",0
"Minneapolis to Orlando. I booked a trip for the family over spring break to Florida to spend a day at Disney World, and a cruise and both have been canceled so we have no need for the airfare until we are able to reschedule our trip. I have talked to an agent 4 times and 1 manager. The first agent that canceled our flight told me everything was put back on my voucher the part I used and the rest of the money was placed on an electronic credit. He told me they would both be good until March 20th 2021 because I booked the trip last year and I would get an email with the information within 48 hours. I waited and got no information so not wanting to lose the money I called back and the new agent told me I would lose the voucher on April 9th this year and the credit is only good until November this year, I explained to her I would be unable to use the voucher by April 9th with everything going on. She told me to fill out a complaint form and call back the next day and they would forward my call to team that could help me. I filled out the form right away and called back today, the agent that was helping me said he could fix the voucher and more the experience date out, as I was on hold the phone was disconnected so I called back again and explained to the agent what happened and what he told me he could do. This agent went on and told me there is nothing they can do and I would be forfeiting my voucher and losing that money. I asked to talk to a manager and after asking multiple times they had a manager call me back. the manager said they reviewed the call and the agent gave me bad information and I would be forfeiting my voucher if not used by April 9th per their upper manager. I asked to get a copy of the audio recording and he said I could not get it and there is no one else I can talk to about this. As of right now Sun Country Airlines is stealing my money. If I know what was going to happen with this Coronavirus I would of booked a trip before my kids spring break, but being able to use this voucher I was able to afford a trip for the many this spring break. I would recommend not to use Sun Country Airlines for any travel they just want money and don't care of their customer not to mention they take advantage of this Coronavirus to take money without giving services. FYI I tried using the option 8 to call back and never got a call back so I have sent right around 12 hours to get this information",0
"I booked a flight from Providence to Houston and we got a 2 hr delay in Providence and then a 4 hour delay in New York. What was supposed to be a 7 hrs total trip took 20 hrs. That was the way down to Houston TX, then on our way back we got another delay in NY. For 2 more hrs. I would never recommend anyone to travel with Delta airline, they are absolutely the worst airline to fly with.",0
San Juan to Miami. I have never been so disappointed with an airline. I am actually sitting and waiting to be boarded on a standby flight. I checked in 1 minute after the one hour mark was told that nothing could be done. I am here with 5 other families including my own that all arrived here at the same time. Even families with no luggage were not permitted to board. I watched them give my ticket away to people in standby once I got to the gate. This is ridiculous.,0
EY22 Manchester to Abu Dhabi EY622 Abu Dhabi to Mahe EY621 Mahe to Abu Dhabi EY15 Abu Dhabi to Manchester. We decided to try Etihad rather than fly with Emirates. What a mistake. There is no leg room if you are tall. When the person in front put their seats back it was most uncomfortable and the staff only begrudgingly asked them to put them upright when the meal was being served. The food was not very good. There was no clean up of the toilets during a 7.5 hour flight. There was no way you could walk around as if you went to the rear of the plane the staff frowned if you went into their space. The films on offer were not very good. The Etihad flight from the Seychelles was an hour late and we came into gate 35 then had to rush to transit at gate 1 and then rush to gate 36 for our Manchester flight. All in all it was an experience that we will not be repeating.,0
I have flown American Airlines over 60 times in 2014 without issue. I must say the customer service is much better than a couple of years ago and now with US Airways part of the family the ability to travel to about any destination you desire is there. I will continue to fly AA and with new planes new look and better customer service I will enjoy doing so.,1
"London to Singapore. I have to commend BA staff on this occasion. They were friendly, welcoming and so accommodating to passengers throughout the flight. Even in the last few moments they were laughing and joking with us. Highly professional and sensitive to our needs despite their own tiredness. Thank you BA for making a long journey a tolerable one.",1
"One of the worst services I've ever encountered. I was told I'm no longer on the flight less than 24 hours before departure. I emailed on the 22nd of April asking if I can receive a refund for my flight, which I did not receive. I was given alternative options such as rebooking my flight for a future date, but not once was I told that my flight would be or has been cancelled for me, only to find out myself a few hours before the flight. The woman I spoke to on the phone was very rude and unprofessional, ignoring my emails and ending the call on me several times. This flight was important for me to take as I had a connecting flight after, and I was told that the only way I could take the flight is if I upgrade and pay 400 levs. I paid for my original ticket, and for it to be cancelled for me without any notice is absurd, any other airline would at least email me or let me know? I have been on many flights and I have never encountered something like this.",0
"Athens to Larnaca. The airline cancelled the flight and not willing to give back the money after 6 months. No answers, simply stole the money and looks like they can do it without any repercussions.",0
"Newark to Orlando. Flight attendant was very rude. He wanted my husband and I to pull up our seats for take off and he didn't even ask politely. It was like he was talking to 2 kids. ""Come on come on pull up your seats"" while he made hand gestures that are used for toddlers. He got even louder to attract an audience. Flew many times and the flight attendants were always so polite but this attendant today, I think he woke up on the wrong side of the bed. There are a lot of kids on this flight and maybe he was aggitated because of the kids. Worst experience ever. Please coach him.",0
"Haikou to Sydney. This service on this flight is outstanding. Cabin Manager is friendly, professional and she provides help at the first time when I have a request. The Hai Chef provided me with excellent meals on this flight. The crew demonstrated a professional service standard.",1
"AirAsia has no proper customer support and not able to reach customer care. They have bot AVA with limited options that can't resolve your issues. Due to cheap quality website, I got duplicate ticket for same flight on same date. I raised a ticket and try to follow up with airasia.com in many ways but no luck.",0
"Worst possible experience. It's not that the flight was delayed, I get that but it was delayed 7 hours overnight. They would not comp a hotel room, but worst of all I didn't even get any communications that it was delayed. Their customer service is abysmal. First time flying with this carrier. Will never fly with them again. Rather walk.",0
"I travelled with my mum from Zhengzhou to Toronto via Guangzhou. I  would like to say thanks to the staff in Zhengzhou airport check in I just realised I have to apply for the ETA before I get in to Canada when I arrived in the Zhengzhou airport on my fly day. I was so worried that I might miss my flight, and my mum who cannot speak English has to go to Canada alone, etc. But the Zhengzhou airport check in desk people helped me to get the approve of ETA as soon as they can before the flight check in closed.",1
Checkin was very complicated and not user friendly at all. We had to call their customer service and wait for hours. Our flight got delayed multiple times from 9pm to next day 11am. With no answers and no money back or support to go back with another flight. We were given a phone number to call for getting our money back and after waiting on call for about half an hour and being on the phone with them for 45min they hang up our call. Ridiculous and worst experience of my travel.,0
"Mint seats are great. Attentive staff, excellent service, great seats, new planes, lovely food. What's not to like. Only issue is LAX airport is seriously grim and there didn't appear to be a lounge. Book and have a great flight.",1
"Gatwick to Malaga. On way out, the younger male cabin crew were rude however on return the older male crew was excellent. Good flight, reasonable price food and drink and of course WiFi is good to have",1
"London Heathrow to Tunis Carthage. Plane was at least over 2 hrs late from departure but our return flight was on time. Service was ridiculously slow. Had 2 ask a few time the same staff member for some water. Food was not tasty, however my issue is the dirt and bacteria from a seating position is absolutely disgusting. Filth is not acceptable on that level, especially at the cost of their tickets. Tunisair you should be ashamed of yourself.",0
"Boston to Manchester via Reykjavik. Booked this flight as it said we would arrive in Manchester in time for my husband to get home and have enough time to get to Old Trafford for the United v City match. We were due to take off at 8am. We were still sat on the plane, and did not taxi to runway until 9.30. Sad to say cabin crew kept a very low profile and in the time we sat waiting only 1 message from the pilot. It goes without saying we will not be flying with Icelandair again.",0
"San Francisco to New York. I paid as much money as anybody else, however my seat at the very back of the plane was not reclining on an overnight flight. The little comfort I could have had was not given to me. The stewardess told me there is nothing she can do. I do not recommend the airline.",0
"I had booked a flight from Mumbai to Guwahati and back for Nov 2022. In October 2022 Indigo cancelled the flight and given an option for refund, saying the full amount will be paid to you. After getting assurance that I will get a full refund, I confirmed for cancellation. But later I got an email that part amount will be deducted towards agent booking charges. If the cancellation is by Indigo why do I bear such cancellation charges?",0
Edmonton to Toronto via Barbados. I'm so impressed at the service from WestJet. We had to book last minute flights for a funeral which is very expensive in peak season. They gave us a bereavement discount and everybody treated us with kindness and respect as they all seem to know we were travelling for a funeral. It made a difficult time much more pleasant. As an added note a staff member in Barbados went above and beyond for us and the flight attendants more funny and pleasant. It's so refreshing to have such a human face on a big company. Thank you WestJet!,1
Raleigh to Houston. Ticket was very reasonably priced. The plane was clean and boarding was organized well. The staff was friendly and courteous and the pilot and flight attendants greated passengers with a smile as we left. It was my first time flying Frontier and I will definitely fly with them again.,1
"I am a Montreal resident and I have been hearing a lot of complaints about the airline on the internet but I found these issues to be isolated at best and should not reflect the overall service given. I flew premium economy and in terms of value vs experience it was a very enjoyable flight. Seat Pitch was comfortable at 37 inches and the recline was good. They gave me two choices on the menu for supper and it was very tasty considering it's airline food. Contrary to what I heard for the on board entertainment, some of the releases were fairly new. The service offered was professional and courteous. My needs as a customer were met. Priority boarding was a nice feature. I really like that part. The flights were on time and boarding was quick. For all those who are booking with this airline, I would suggest going Premium Rouge for long flights.",1
Flight 464 from Frankfurt to Orlando June 21 2014. Trip started in Istanbul June 21 2014 on flight 1305. We booked our flights 9 months ago. My seat on flight 464 from Frankfurt to Orlando was 39c. I checked in online double checked at the Frankfurt gate still 39 c. Once onboard my seat was given to another who booked late. The new seat was in another section of the plane nowhere near my husband. Since the flight was full the attendants would not move this passenger and were unhelpful. The purser was surly and rude.,0
First time flying and the flight attendant made my flight enjoyable by keeping me calm and making light conversation when she had time since she knew I was very nervous and alone! Definitely recommend this airline all of my flights were on time or early with no complications!,1
"Berlin to Frankfurt. I have used Air Berlin for the first time and the last time. They overbooked the 8.50am flight, AB6577, flying from Berlin to Frankfurt by 10 seats. They bumped us and told us they could not book us another flight the same day. They offered us a 2nd class train ticket and told us to take a bus to the train station. They did not offer to pay for a hotel if we flew out the next day. Overall the personnel were matter of fact. ""This is our company policy. Take it or leave it. But don't make me repeat it."" I don't know how airlines can get away with selling seats multiple times. It's not worth it to fly Air Berlin to save a couple of Euros. Next time we choose an airline that knows what quality service is.",0
"Los Angeles to Amman via Jeddah. First time ever traveling with Saudi Arabian Airlines, usually we travel with Emirates. Got my sister and my niece ticket from Amman to Los Angeles. I can't say enough about the person who checked us at the airport in Los Angeles her name is Susan, she was very patient, took her time and provide us with an excellent service.",1
"The air hostess was exceptionally rude. Everything was someone else's fault. Allowed other passengers to bully passengers and said they belonged on ""Southwest"". Heck, this plane made Southwest look like the big time. Everything is an extra add on amenity. Waste of money!",0
Philadelphia to Miami. In the last 2 years more and more frequently the service is getting worse. Today we are waiting on board more than hours for catering. Wait more than a 1 day and American airlines canceled the trip. We almost lost the trip to Aruba. Preview I traveled to Cuba and they offered a Voucher for 2000 whoever is canceling the trip The service is getting worse and worse No respectful at all.,0
"Ft Lauderdale to Chicago. Very disappointed, worst experience with this company! Not only that our two flights were delayed by two hours and one hour but also they didn't allow us with a baby 2 months and 3 years to board earlier like preboarding which other airlines allow and also gave us tickets in the last row of the plane. Never ever will fly again with them!!",0
We booked a trip to Mexico from Edmonton and it started ok delayed at the airport 2 hrs but I can live with that. On the return flight we were asked to check with are rep before heading to the airport so we wouldn't waste any time so we did and everything was good to go so they said. We arrived at the airport 3 hrs early then were told there was a delay. It was supposed to leave at 4.45 then 9.45 then 3.00. Finally at 3.45 we were on the runway after spending 13 hrs in a Mexican airport where everything closed at 11pm.,0
Fayetteville to Boston. Our flight was delayed due to a mechanical issue so we were unable to make our connecting flight. I rebooked to Raleigh with the help of a very patient and helpful employee but it was not an easy process. The entire system was shut down so he was unable to rebook on the computer and had to do so over phone. He was also not able to print a customer service voucher for our taxi to Raleigh because of the system being down as well. Not a great performance by United Airlines software developers. Hire better.,0
"New York JFK to Gatwick. Original flight booked with Norwegian Air was cancelled so we lost the price of our nonrefundable American airline tickets to JFK. We scheduled a later Norwegian flight and paid for two more airline American Airline tickets to JFK. Not happy that the original flight was cancelled but Norwegian did step up and reimburse us for the two original nonrefundable tickets to JFK. Was pleasantly surprised that Norwegian Air did this. Our flight from JFK to Gatwick was no frills but the plane was nice and it was a great value. Yes, we would fly Norwegian Air again. Thank you Norwegian Air.",1
"Kolkata to Port Blair with Vistara. Excellent flight with tasty quality food, comfortable seating arrangement, far better than other domestic airlines. Landed before time. Colourful and beautiful flight.",1
Be very careful with this company. The charged me 95 euros because the trolley weight was 10 kg and they have 8 kg limit. Also avoid showing your American pass if you have a European pass. It looks they check trolley weight more to foreigners more to locals.,0
"I had a rather unpleasant experience with this airline. One simple cancellation, due to a storm, and their Charlotte hub information desk was understaffed and hopelessly overcrowded with stressed customers. I waited my turn, for nearly two hours, to ask whether they could provide any accommodation, and they turned me down. My online request was met with indifference. Not okay, AA, it was a mistake trying you.",0
"Larnaca to London via Athens. They have wonderful cabin staff and are helpful, there with a smile. The food on board is very good as is the service, even though my flight stops over in Athens rather than direct, its still enjoyable. Only problem I had was first time at ATthens, when you are in transit its not clear where to go when you enter the airport . Apart from that can't fault anything keep up the good work.",1
Booking and flying with PLAY was very easy and confortable. Cabin crew were very friendly and planes were spot on. Transfer time in Reykjavik was fine and the boarding process smooth. I flew to New York Stewart  which is approx. 90 min. from Manhattan. This is a very small airport and passport control was fast and very friendly. Good connection to Manhattan with a bus service from the airport to Port Authority Bus Terminal. All together very good experience.,1
"Belgrade to Seattle via Paris. When I arrived to Seattle, my luggage was not there. I asked the Air France staff where it was, and the guy looked at the list of all passengers and searched for my name. At the part where are the details about luggage was written only ""??"". However, they told me that it is in Paris and it will arrive on my address tomorrow morning. They are obligated to give a kit containing toiletries to passengers whose baggage did not arrive on time. But they did not give it to me because they don't have it there. Three days after, the luggage is still not here.",0
"Dallas to Salt Lake City. I could not be more disgusted with an attitude and lack of confidence check in. Over an hour and a half in a bag check line with over half of the agent stations empty. A nonsensical woman walking around telling people who are going to miss their flight they should have gotten there earlier. What a waste of oxygen. I just have one thing to say to people thinking about booking a flight on Delta, don't.",0
"Toronto to Orlando. Zero leg space, I'm not a large individual, 5ft 8in tall and 120lbs and it was not a comfortable ride. Staff wasnt very kind when I ordered soup and then the tray on the seat back in front of me collapsed and became unusable for holding hot soup.  I also had a drink on the tray, so I cannot hold 2 liquids and eat at the same time. No signage for the toilets, and armrests had buttons on them, cant rest your elbow without accidentally calling the flight attendants. Would never fly this airline again.",0
Sydney to London via Abu Dhabi. Etihad are refusing to give full refunds to customers for flights cancelled. Instead they are offering credit. This is worse than useless. We are severely out of pocket and don't know when or when we will be able to fly again. All we want is for you to give us back the money.,0
"Colombo to Melbourne. Service was extremely disappointing. We were travelling as assisted passengers as we are elderly. We got virtually no assistance at all. At one stage the airline staff left us at the baggage carousel and my 84 yr old husband had to collect the baggage with help from other passengers. Sadly I have another leg booked on this airline. I would strongly recommend that you do not fly this airline, especially if you are travelling as an assisted passenger. The cabin service was poor also. The food was equally bad. In addition, it was a rather expensive fare.",0
"Would give 0 stars if I could. Bag policy is a complete rip off and they employ rude employees. In the future I will spend the extra money to fly a different airline, and I recommend you do, too.",0
This airline is terrible! Cannot communicate with anyone! All hidden behind computers. Trying for 2 days to make changes and its an impossible thing to do! Mr Stelios Hadjioannou its about time you take control of this! I will discard this flight and rather loose my money and fly with a decent airline where we can reach someone to talk to.,0
I missed my scheduled flight from Okinawa to Tokyo. Staff in Okinawa did everything to get me on another flight so I had a chance to meet my connecting flight. There was a woman waiting for me when I got off the plane and ran with me to the bus to take me to the international side of airport. Very quickly they had a ticket for the Tokyo flight and the rest of my connecting flights back to Orlando. I made it to the gate in time for my connecting flight. I could not have done this if it was not for all the help I got from ANA staff.,1
I flew from Vancouver to MNL October 5 at 1.40am. This was my first time flying PALs B777. It was a brand new plane compared to their past planes which were A340 or A330. Service was excellent with a very smooth landing.,1
"Milan to Olbia. The worst flight experience. They make you pay for seat selection and to bring a second rollaboard on. Then, when you get to the airport, they make you pay for plastic bags for toiletries, at the gate they force you to check your bag size. My official rollaboard suitcase by luggageworks is too big for their checking devices. Then, they charged me 120 euros to get my and my daughter's rollaboard on the airplane, round trip. Did not refund my fee paid for two rollaboards, failed to enter my round trip fee for the bag, so they tried to charge me again for the return trip. Absolutely sickening service, customer abuse, will never fly again.",0
"Hong Kong to Munich. Delayed by late aircraft towing to gate. Boarding efficient and friendly. On board was perfect, a part from the Business seats which aren't private enough. Lufthansa doesn't have capsules or pods in Business and the lack of privacy is a drawback. Cabin crew, food and menus were excellent.",1
"I need extra leg room and the exit seats for the flight out were not available so I purchased a first class ticket. My expectations were low based on seeing first class customers on previous flights. There is no divider between coach and first class so it doesn't look very special. I was wrong. Can't recall how much extra I paid but it included a couple of checked bags. They marked my luggage priority and it was the first one to land on the carousel when we arrived. The seats were roomy in both legroom and width. Comfortable, too. The plane seemed very clean and bright inside. I wasn't paying close enough attention but it seemed like the flight attendant was always available. They served a decent meal that I wasn't expecting, offered free video screens, had fresh baked chocolate chip cookies and hot towels at the end of the trip. The attendant did a great job of making us feel ""first class"". I don't do alcohol but I assume that was available as well. I plan on doing this again. Was in the exit row on the return trip. Once again great flight attendants and since there were three open exit row seats on the opposite side she moved the couple next to me to the unoccupied seats and I had all 3 seats to myself. All the folks at the ticket counter were pleasant and helpful.",1
"Denpasar to Bangkok. Very bad refund policy due to Covid19, my flight has been canceled but Lion air refused to refund, only give a voucher valid 1 year. I do not plan to flight for 1 year so it is useless. Spent hours with customer service for nothing. Bad experience.",0
Dublin to Melbourne via Doha. I travel at least 3 times a year with different airlines but never got the service which I received on both sections of the flights from Dublin to Melbourne. I may mention one staff on the second flight who went beyond the call of Duty. Definitely a 5 star airline.,1
"Worst experience ever. Plane at the gate, crew waiting for the door to open. Waited until departure time to open up boarding and then had no gate when arrived in TPA. No wifi, no tv, no flight monitor. 2 hours late arriving to gate. Completely useless airline",0
"I had to take an emergency flight out to SC, it was not a planned trip but I found Spirit Airlines online and booked it. The flight was very nice and the staff were great. ",1
We flew via Istanbul to North Cyprus on 24 March 2012 returning a week later. The aircraft on both legs of the journey were immaculate seating was good and the service professional and efficient. I will be travelling with this airline again.,1
Excellent short flight. Great aircraft for short haul. Comfortable. Wi fi plus full inflight entertainment. Particularly great attendant worked graciously and efficiently. The best Delta experience in a while.,1
"Izmir to London via Dusseldorf. A bad experience will not fly with them again. The plane and seats was really comfy but when we arrived at Dusseldorf the staff was so rude, also when I arrived at London Heathrow they did not give me my stroller so I had to carry my toddler. Then when we arrived to collect our baggage they did not put it on the plane with us they left it in Germany, still waiting for it now!",0
"Toronto to Delhi return via Abu Dhabi. Booked vegetarian and all the meals served were horrible. Does somebody eat these food items before giving to the passengers. I saw a steward eating cheap noodle packet with hot water, perhaps she knew the quality of Etihad's food. our food came at different time or one was served earlier and other one was not served or took an half an hour delay. When told the steward, she was rude. Air condition in the the cabin was too cold and I saw a lot of passengers were shivering. Movies quit several times as the systems had to boot. Seats were old.",0
"You have to watch a lot of advertising about Qatar during the flight. The seats were not comfortable, the flight attendants were friendly but overchallenged with the service. I had to wait more than half an hour to get a can of beer, they wouldn't give me enough water. My request for any snacks was friendly denied two times in a row. I cannot recommend this airline.",0
"The worst airline that exists, the crew was rude to me, the food is average. If you call customer service they tell you that the waiting time is 2 hours.  I flew Miami Montreal Athens, what a nightmare, the first delayed flight, I was able to make the connection because all their flights are delayed. Back I had a layover of 3 hours and I spent all of them making lines in the corridors of the airport trying to check point for American citizens, something incredible. On my last flight Montreal Miami I had upgraded my seat to one in aisle since I had come from a 10 hour flight and I wanted to be more comfortable and when I finally got to the counter they changed my seat to one in the middle and told me that they would make me a refund. It was not about the refund but that I had paid and chosen a seat and they changed me without any explanation. Extremely rude plane crew, really do yourself a big favor and avoid this airline.",0
I will never fly Spirit again in my life. I would rather pay triple the price than travel with Spirit. They changed my flight last minute and added a stop to my round trip. My flight was supposed to be an hour and a half and it ended up being a ten hour flight. Spirit did not offer any form of compensation. I called and asked to change my flight and they did nothing at all. Very rude customer service. I do not recommend Spirit Airlines to anyone!,0
"Winnipeg to Edmonton, WO505 on 11th February. I am beyond disappointed in the service we received with Swoop. We have been delayed 4 times. 1 departing and an extreme amount getting home. This has been an extreme inconvenience. I will miss a family funeral and my husband is missing appointments that cannot be rebooked for a long time, not to mention we are flying with an 8 month old. This has caused more then enough anxiety the entire day awaiting the next delay.",0
"I actually have not flown Cape Air yet as my ticket is for 2 weeks from now. I emailed Cape Air asking for refund due to corona virus. Sadly, I live in US and nobody can travel, all people are cancelling trips .. so it's not possible for me to get to San Juan and then take the Cape Air flight even I wanted to. Other airlines, hotels, are refunding ok. Cape Air said I could reuse the ticket in coming months, then I said, like most, I will not be able to afford to travel for this kind of expensive trip for years as we resave. Then I get an email message that Cape AIr literally 'blocked me' from emailing them. Despite the fact that almost nobody will be able to fly Cape Air for several weeks so plans will be empty, despite the fact that Cape Air will likely cancel most flights soon anyway, Cape Air is 'choosing' to keep all the money from hundreds of flights over coming weeks paid by people getting sick, losing jobs, and in crisis. Pay more if you have to for another airline!",0
"This airline completely ruined our summer. Me, my husband, and my 2 kids were flying from LAX to Norfolk when our flights were cancelled yesterday. We were already packing, as the trip was only a few days away. We were all disappointed, my kids especially. I will make sure to never fly this airline again. This airline seemed great because of the cheap prices, but no wonder its cheap, they cancel everyones flights. I tried to rebook, but the next flight flying out of LAX was in February 2023. So I would not use this airline if you want to go somewhere because chances are, your flight will be cancelled. This would have been my first time flying with this airline, but I will never fly this airline again.",0
Had a positive and pleasant experience flying to and from Tenerife South from Edinburgh. Better than our last two trips with Jet2 and Thomson. If you read the rules and follow them there is no problem. Priority boarding was adhered to so no stampede needed. The staff were efficient and pleasant. I will definitely use Ryanair again.,1
"One of the worst customer services I had ever seen. The whole team needs to be trained, they are very rude. I am writing the review from the airplane with Jetblue right now, I was not able to reach home to give a review because of their rudeness. At least when someone says thank you, at least what you can do is reply back. The bathroom is so dirty. I would never ever fly with them even if it was just as a connecting flight. They do not know how to treat customers. All I am asking is to be treated well as I am treating you.",0
Spirit Airlines is always my last choice. Nothing about this trip has proved me wrong. There is nothing worse. Not even Frontier. Book Frontier before Spirit.,0
"WOW air is the Worst airline, terrible experience. Our flight from Miami to Keflavik was cancelled after a 4 hour delay. No information or explanation was given. Then, after 3 hours in line waiting for any refund or rebook of our flight with no answer, they just tell us ""call customer service"". We were left alone with no help. We had to rebook our own flights and paid our hotel and food. We have been trying to talk to someone in customer service and the call center never works. No answer after one week. We're still trying to contact them for our refund.",0
"I am a frequent traveler, but I have never dealt with an airline as frustrating as this one.  At the start of my flight I had to surrender my carry on, and I never saw it again. I filed a lost baggage claim in Manaus, and I did not even receive a copy of the claim. The agent told me to photograph the report, which was hand written. Three passengers on the half filled flight lost luggage, including some expensive fishing equipment.  When I arrived in Panama City for my layover the baggage wasn't there, and employees brushed me off for two hours. Since the loss of the bag I have sent two emails to Copa, and I phoned them today. The emails have been unanswered, and the call was futile, I was simply told to send another email for them to ignore. This airline is staffed by incompetent people who are totally unconcerned about their service.",0
"This is not my first or second or third problem that we've had been flying on Frontier. Often the flights are delayed, they refuse to communicate with their passengers to explain what is causing the delay or how long the delay will be. I once waited 5 hours at the airport with no one able to answer questions. I was traveling with my two small children and at 11 at night when the airport closed we are forced to get a hotel room. That's unacceptable. I would have made arrangements.",0
"Toronto to New York La Guardia. Quick 1 hour flight. I found the seat on the E145 to be more comfortable than that on the Air Canada Rouge 767, which is good. Staff were very helpful, overall had a great experience.",1
I have booked flights from Durban to Cape Town and this needed to be changed due to the Covid 19 pandemic. I contacted Mango and was informed that vouchers will be sent to accommodate me. No vouchers received to date and numerous emails sent with no response.,0
"If you want to fly an airline that makes you think that Ryanair is a luxury airline, then this is for you. I am a frequent flyer and in all the years of flying I would say this was the worst experience I have had. It began with check in. I checked in in advance to save time except that baggage drop off took much longer than the other line. Much longer. The wait was close to 90 minutes. No informed staff to offer clear directions either. Then flight delayed massively without announcement and without staff to assist. And no food vouchers even. Avoid like the plague. Any savings you imagine making this worthwhile are not worth it.",0
"The worst experience. I applied for quarantine packages to Etihad holiday and waited for four days, they didn't respond and then I made a call, they told me that I can book any hotel that I'd affiliated with Saudi embassy. I booked the hotel but when we arrived at the airport they said we don't accept this hotel. Many times they misguided me. I suggest you that don't book quarantine packages for this worst flight.",0
Service was not good time keeping both ways was poor and on the return a delay of 6 hrs with little information from staff. Very expensive for what it was only soft drinks and a small pack of biscuits both journeys. Thought it would be better considering BA share this flight.,0
"Frankfurt to St Louis. I have been a Senator Member of Lufthansa since many years and always enjoyed a fantastic service. However, since last year the service level has nose dived, be it the ground staff or the cabin attendants. Everybody seems to be in a foul mood always and absolutely not bothered to make the flying experience of its passengers pleasant. In my last flight from Frankfurt to St Louis the quality of the food was pathetic to say the least. It seems the quality of food that was served earlier to Economy class is now being served to Premium Economy. The Economy Class food is not up to the mark of Lufthansa level. Last year I had a very unpleasant experience at Valencia airport while travelling to Dubai and I couldn't fly. I had to buy an Emirates flight as an alternate as it was an urgent journey and I was more than surprised with the excellent service and the quality of the flight. I wrote about the unpleasant experience while checking in at Valencia to the Customer Service in Lufthansa and never heard back anything from them. I think it is the time to ditch my fidelity to Miles and More and look for an alternate if the service levels are not improved.",0
"Airline cancelled my flights due to Covid. I've been waiting eight months for my refund. Every time I call, the agents are unnecessarily rude. I will never, ever fly this airline again.",0
I was supposed to travel AirAsia Philippines from Cebu to Manila. AirAsia Philippines changed the flight departure time from 20.10 to 23.20. No compensation and an unengaged staff that couldn't care less. Will never fly them again.,0
Johannesburg to Cape Town. The flight was perfect the flight attendants were very nice. Overall it was a good flight. It was so cheap and the money was worth it I couldn't believe you can fly for just about five hundred rand it was nice.,1
"Flight on time, boarding time perfect. Plane old but in good condition. In all a very good experience and very nice timing of entry into the plane that made for a very nice boarding.",1
Wilmington to Charlotte. Worst traveling experience in my life. Rude customer service. I paid for a first class ticket and was treated like i didn't matter as a customer. On top of that they would not give me a hotel and now I'm sleeping on the floor in an airport. I would not recommend this airline to anyone.,0
"As it was for a couple of days I took just hand luggage, no problem leaving Luton but coming back from Venice the booking area insisted it was too large for hand luggage and should go into the hold. Not a nice person so insisted a fee of 32 euros was paid. I have never flown budget airlines and I will never use a company like this again. I never booked this trip so could not believe how bad they are. A Hungarian company, making money by illegal ways.",0
"Barcelona to Athens. Due to the Easter season, all passengers were given chocolate Easter eggs. The flight was on time. The airplane was very clean, along with the bathroom. Hot towels with lavender scent were provided, and a welcome drink was given. The food was excellent. The seats were leather, and reclined well. The airline magazine was available to every passenger, while a tour of Greece and Cyprus played on overhead TV's. Inflight shopping was available. The crew spoke good English. One of the best flights I have even been on, and would certainly fly with Aegean Airlines again.",1
Flew last month on a flight From Kuala Lumpur to Colombo. The service onboard was fantastic meals were very good and inflight movie range was a big selection travelled on the A320 was well impressed with the leg room as I am 6'3.,1
Paphos to East Midlands. Will definitely fly Jet2 again. Love the free resort flight check in it was so easy and stress free. All staff encountered where friendly and helpful.,1
"Absolutely the worst communication from American Airlines. Rude staff, flight from Philadelphia to Seattle got delayed 9 hours with yet again no communication to the guests. I will drive to the rest of my vacations due to the experience we received. This is unacceptable. 2 thumbs down will not recommend this flight to anyone, friends or family",0
"I had the best experience flying with Spirit airlines, I fly on March 11th Flight NK261 from Portland to Las Vegas Flight NK954 from Las Vegas to Fort Lauderdale. Thank you Spirit Airlines from the bottom of my heart. I was impressed by your kindness and attention, everyone was very polite and sympathetic to me. The wheelchair assistance was nice and polite and helped me in everything I needed. Big thanks to the pilots and stewardesses! It is hard that I don't know English but I wanted to see my kids and grandkids.",1
Flight 114 from Birmingham was not so great 3.5 hrs late. Departure time was 5.30pm but departed at 9.40pm. When we were boarding the plane looked great however upon take off there were problems. They did not have any vegetarian dishes they came back with bread rolls and butter for the rest of the flight. When we got to Delhi we were delayed a further 4hrs due. Poor flight and service.,0
"London to Mumbai. Terrible customer service. I have benn trying to change my flight with them for the last three days, and they keep blaming the travel agent, even through the ticket was issued by BA, after the meltdown on the 27th. If you get through to their India call center you might as welll hang up the phone, as they are rude and all they will do is keep blaming the third party, will inturpt you when you are trying to speak, just awful service. Agree British airways is going downhill. Been a silver member for many years, need to look for another provider. Just awful customer service which BA, won't care to look into.",0
Traveled on March 25 Sydney to Singapore and have no complaints with our flight at all. Flight left about 10 mins early and arrived into SIN on time. Booked the extra leg room seats up front and the additional cost was worth it. Airline food is airline food when sitting in economy with any airline not to flash.,1
"Cathay Pacific Airways are my preferred airline and I have flown them many times. I travelled Doha to Hong Kong business class on their A330. From the moment you enter the aircraft you are looked after excellently. I am a Oneworld Emerald and it is a nice touch when the purser or CSD gives you an extra welcome and chat prior to departure, thanking me for flying with Cathay. They look after the regular travellers and go out of their way to make sure you are well looked after, served food and drinks first, giving you more time to rest. The seat is very comfortable and spacious with lots of storage space and space next to the window. Seat reclines to the full flat position. What I like about the seat is that the screen folds away and also the tray table. I am very tall and  can stretch out fully in these seats. The food is of a high quality and tasty, and a good range of beverages including the Champagne. Entertainment is varied and extensive. ",1
"Hat Yai to Don Muang with Thai Lion Air. Staff are very friendly and polite, staff member took me to my seat and put my carry on bag in the over head bin for me. The seat is comfortable. The airplane take off and landing was smooth. The flight departed and arrived on time. The fare is very reasonable, better than the bus and the train if you book in advance. Before buying ticket the travel agent let me know ahead one small carry on luggage is free. The other luggage will be charged.",1
"They changed the flight by 3 hours, not enough to get a refund but enough to make the flight time not work for me due to work. Called customer service where I was recited the policy of a 4 hour change requirement to get a refund and issued a travel voucher to use in a year with no options through their company that work with this trip. Terrible company that only cares about money. Cancelling my miles reward card and avoiding flying with them at all costs, I would recommend you do yourself a favor and do the same.",0
I flew from Denver to San Diego on 8.59pm flight. We did not board until 9.20pm and started to taxi but returned to the gate due to the plane had a malfunction with one engine. We didn't taxi for another 20 minutes which all of this caused a serious delay! All of these events seemed to be a disorganization on Frontiers' behalf. After all of this confusion and frustration Frontier employees acted as if they did passengers a favor. No compensation was awarded i.e. beverages or anything. On top of this distraction I landed late causing my rental car reservation to be cancelled and had to barter with taxi drivers for transportation to my hotel. As far as I'm concerned this airline has the worst customer service bar none!,0
"Horrible experience from Cebu Pacific. We knew we would have excess baggage weight prior to our departure so I tried calling them and logging in online to purchase additional weight allowance however their phone does not seem to work, their website doesn't recognize the booking reference we have. Come day of departure we were charged enormous amount per kilo. Seems like we are meant to deal with the problem directly to the ticketing counter on the day of departure so they can charge more.",0
vGreat airline. Got 4 tickets for less then the price of 1 ticket if I fly with Westjet or Air Canada. Bought a checked bag. Weight exceeded on the bag by a few pounds. No problems at all. Flew exactly on time and returning flight returned exactly on time. The seats were comfortable and inflight entertainment was great. Our family had absolutely no problems. We loved the flight and the crew were super friendly. We followed the simple rules they mentioned on the website which was show up early and dont expect freebies. Will be booking next flight very soon. We need more ultra low airlines to fly within Canada.,1
Recently flew from Rome to Johannesburg via Jeddah. I was very pleasantly surprised. Flight was comfortable we were given blankets toothbrushes etc the food was good there were mini TVs in the back of each seat and the selection of films and programmes was great. Staff were all friendly and helpful a great experience I wouldn't hesitate to recommend them if they maintain this level of service.,1
"Was on a Ryanair flight today from East Midlands to Bergerac. About 40 mins before landing a lady was taken ill with what seemed to be a serious illness, I can't praise the cabin crew enough about how they handled the situation, they were calm quick and reassuring in the actions they took. I have booked over a thousand single flights for my family over the last 10 years and have never encountered any problems that have been caused by themselves.",1
Terrible. I flew from Sudbury to Toronto to get this flight and the little Dash 8 from Sudbury had more legroom. The lady in front reclined so I watched her hair for 3 hours. Could not see my smartphone even if I had been stupid enough to pay for inflight entertainment on a 4 inch screen.,0
"Flew Aer Lingus with my partner as the it provided the most direct route between Edinburgh and Dublin. Despite travelling together and checking in together we were seated separately. On arriving at the gate we approached a small group of ground staff who were chatting to see if there was any possibility of sitting together. The gate agent was rude and dismissive stating ""if your flying to Dublin go over there and sit down"". After trying to discuss our request she was quite dismissive stating that the previous nights flight was cancelled and she was not prepared to move another passenger to help us. Just appalling behaviour. The flight crew were average with one crew member unable to generate a smile for the entire flight. The lavatory on board was filthy, so dirty I didn't want to touch any of the surfaces. This despite the fact that the cabin crew found plenty of time to sit and read. My overall experience with Aer Lingus was not a good one and will not be using this airline again.",0
"Milano to Medellin via Madrid. Staff is very cold and not helpful at all. We had to pay additional 120 euros at the check in cause the luggage was not included in our ticket. For 10 hours flying you got advertisement and you have to pay for some drinks. THe price is a bit cheaper than other companies, but not worth it. The seats are very  unconfortable, I had a dirty screen and dirty toilet.",0
"Dallas to New York JFK. After working nonstop to be able to fly for New Years to see my family and friends. I was meeting a friend in NY for a day and a half to spend there. American Airlines decides to canceled my flight less than 12 hours before. Their explanations was because the plane of my flight was canceled at his first destination. They scheduled me for 2 days after and I changed it for the next day. I missed my day in NY, the whole reason I did this trip. Never getting a flight with American Airlines.",0
Jeddah to Dammam. The flight was smooth and the seats and meals are good enough. Crew was helpful and cooperative. We've take off from Jeddah on time at new terminal. But the transportation from the terminal to the plane was by bus not the tunnel.,1
Five flights over the last two weeks Islip to BWI to ATL to MDW to LAX then San Diego to Oakland all left and arrived on time effortless check in. Comfortable seats and reasonable leg room. All in all an experience that beats all other US domestic carriers. I have platinum elite status with another carrier here but for domestic flights Southwest beat them hands down.,1
"As a company Vueling Airlines obviously don't care about passengers. Tiny seats, poor legroom, no refreshments of any kind during a 4 hour long flight. We have seen the flight attendant while boarding and disembarking the plane, they were nowhere to be seen during the whole flight. There wasn't any entertainment nor screens with our flight route. in addition, the plane seemed to be very old.",0
Probably one of the worst Economy Class cabins I flew. They pack you in like sardines so you are out of luck whether you are in a window or an Aisle seat. Food is horrid service is not rude but sort of non existent. I enjoyed Israel a lot and found that the airline does not represent the country well. The security part was actually not too bad but the flight was hot cramped and rather unpleasant.,0
Toronto to Puerto Vallarta. Do not take a vacation package with Air Canada they give Credit and they do not reimburse you when you cancel. Even if you have cancelation insurance. I would never book another package with them.,0
Do not use Porter Airlines. The flight itself was fine. Pretty smooth for the type of planes. My flight was delayed since the day before. It was delayed 2 additional times while waiting at Toronto and still did not leave in a timely manner and there as no weather or otherwise justifiable issue. Customer service on the phone was terrible even when I spoke to a supervisor. Save yourself! Don't do it! I read poor reviews and still gave it a chance.,0
"Paris Orly to Cayenne. The aircraft took off and landed at the right time. In flight meals and entertainment were OK, with a large choice of films and music. Reclining seats in night positions bother the passenger behind. It would be better if Air France would use new seats.",1
"Ljubljana to Malaga via Amsterdam. I chose a flight, in the following steps they promise I can purchase check in baggage afterwards online but in reality I was searching for the online booking option for one hour and in the end called the company to hear that this was not possible! The woman on the telephone tells me that I have to buy the check in baggage on the airport counter on my day of check in. Worst is that she can't even cant even tell me how much this will more or less cost!",0
"Munich to Vancouver. We travel to Europe every year for vacation. This year, we flew from Europe to Canada and in the process, our luggage was misplaced. We arrived in Vancouver, Canada only to find out the news. Our luggage was delivered within 2 days of landing at home via a delivery service that was free of charge. Furthermore, we reached out to Lufthansa and the customer relations department was timely in their response and was kind. They acknowledged our concerns and inconvenience and offered a remedy package to show their apology. We were pleased with the way Lufthansa Customer Relations handled the situation. Accidents happen on a daily basis and nobody or no company is perfect but they went out of their way to make sure we were satisfied. We truly appreciate their generosity and concern. We enjoy flying with Lufthansa because they have been very respectful and polite over the years. They stated this, ""We are sorry for the inconvenience. We look forward to welcoming you on board in the near future and the opportunity to regain your confidence."" and I can honestly say that they have won me back.",1
We were pleased with our flight from Chicago to Denver and Denver to Las Vegas. I wish they had told us ahead of time that the seats in front of the emergency door don't recline. Our son has to have a reclining seat and we were not told about this prior to purchasing our tickets.,1
"Had to cancel flight for personal emergency that was not covered by flight insurance. When I went to cancel on website, said the charge to cancel would only be part of my fare and I expected a partial refund. Now they are keeping the entire fare and can not even get a straight answer from the completely unhelpful customer service agents as to why there is a discrepancy and complete lack of transparency on the website for charges to cancel flight. Horrible service and a dishonest company. Never again.",0
"Horrid company. Changed our flight the day of with zero notification. Cost us well over 1000 dollars extra to rent a car and drive home. Horrible company, poor customer service. Avoid flying with them at all cost. Matter of fact if you calculate all the baggage fees and your money ahead, fly a reputable airline for the extra cost. Spirit is the only airline I've ever booked with, never set foot on a plane, and the only airline that has ever screwed me over.",0
On board Mint class from LAX to JFK. Impressive in all aspects. Seat entertainment food and service. The other carriers better watch out. Provided the pricing remains competitive I'm a convert.,1
Travelled on Air Serbia from Thessaloniki to Copenhagen via Belgrade and they were my best flights. Cabin crew was very helpful and friendly and the food was very delicious. Absolutely perfect.,1
Delhi to Paris via Kuwait. The flight got delayed twice and I was stranded in the night at the airport. Never book Kuwait airways as the passengers travelling were not good and the airline did nothing over the issue.  I highly recommend spending money on other airlines.,0
"JFK to Nice via DUS. Flight was awful. The whole flight was spent with a woman putting her seat back in my lap. Mind you the legroom was barely existent to begin with. The seat back TV had no sound and the one on my wife's side had no picture. The crew while strolling by didn't really react to anything. The food? The ""meal"" on this flight was inedible! I could barely wait for them to take it away! The only saving grace was the warm beers I could occasionally get from a bored crew member. The second leg was thankfully quick and over fast no food and they wanted money for everything. Sometimes comfort is worth the price.",0
"I didn't like that they changed the type of plane that I had booked, seems to be that this is normal. Anyway I was impressed with the comfort of the seats, the food, the internet and the service. ",1
"Dalian to Bangkok via Seoul. On both flights, service was good, quiet in Business to Seoul, but fairly full to Bangkok. Cabin Service good, entertainment good and seat comfort very good. Meals and beverages good, with good Western choice.",1
"My first sector was from Madrid to Dubai. The purser on this flight was the crown jewel of the Emirates hospitality I remembered from my past travels. However she was assigned to business class whilst I was served by one crew who made my Emirates journey an utter disaster. The food on this flight was spectacular. The beef lasagna was great. The entertainment was limited compared to the newer A380s however it did have brilliant things that kept me entertained for 7 hours. Before take off I noticed that a customer who complained of a leaking AC was just shut down by a crew member who said 'cover your head for now, it'll stop after take off'. What a displeasing attitude from an airline renowned to be one of the best in the world.  At the meal service I noticed that meals run out when it comes to the seats at the back. The menu on that flight consisted of a chicken and beef option only, even though traditionally airlines of that calibre opt to offer a vegetarian option too. They had run out of the chicken option and my friend who for religious reasons does not consume beef, was forced with the beef option saying that was all they had. Whilst they refused to eat it, the crew who were called many times didn't even make a single appearance to enquire. Finally when it came to the pre arrival snack, they offered a chicken option and cheese option. The crew member just served the food without asking what I wanted. When I opened I realised I was given the tasteless cheese option. However, the passengers behind us were offered both where they had a choice.  My next flight was from Dubai to Colombo. Another unpleasant journey with the unsuitable comportment of the cabin crew. One of them refused to pour a full glass of apple juice for my father.",0
"I took Hainan Airlines business class for a 15 hour flight from Beijing to Boston. Very easy check in, really like the self baggage check in. The attendant answered all my question and concerns and was happy to provide any help I needed. Departed on time and arrived on time. Nice staff onboard. Great flight.",1
Very disappointing service from SIA. Plane was dirty departing SIN and staff communication was poor. Staff were curt to the point of thinly veiled rudeness. Lots of room for improvement here.,0
How pleasantly surprised I was flew London to Ho Chi Minh Ho Chi Minh to Da Nang Da Nang to Siem Reap Siem Reap to Hanoi and Hanoi to London. All excellent on time excellent service comfort and value. The prop plane used to fly to Siem Reap was a delight. Would not hesitate to use again easily comparable to its competitors.,1
"My flight for July 19th was cancelled by Ethiopian airlines, since 1 month now I am chasing them for a refund. Customer service is incompetent with basic spelling and huge English language understanding issues. If by some miracle you will get through 1h of waiting on hold to go through the customer service call you will face unbelievable issues where a simple task seems impossible to achieve and a refund status follow up is more difficult than a trip to Mars. I will never use this airline again.",0
"Latrobe to Orlando. One of the worst airlines I have ever flown. They decided to cancel my business trip flight at 4 in the morning, leaving me to scramble for another flight, which as you all know, cost a pretty penny. Their customer service has always been extremely rude, and their flights have always been the most uncomfortable and shaky. I know people say this all the time, but with Spirit airlines you really get what you pay for. Maybe even less.",0
"Christchurch to Sydney via Auckland. As Air New Zealand does not have business class trans tasman from some cities I had to take my flight via Auckland. We took off on time but, unfortunately there was a medical emergency on board and the flight had to land back in Christchurch. I understand and support the fact that the aircraft turned around to ensure the health of the passenger. There were numerous passengers connecting on different flights. I asked the crew member and she told me that the airline had made arrangements on arrival in Auckland for connecting flights and that we would need to hurry to catch the connecting flight. Arrived in Auckland and were met by an Air New Zealand staff member and were put on a bus to international terminal. At no time was I told that they would not hold the connecting flight NZ105. Had to run through the terminal and immigration to try and catch the flight, there was an Air New Zealand representative outside immigration who told me the gate had closed a few minutes ago and that I needed to go to the international transfer desk. I attended the transfer desk only to be advised that I would be put on an alternative flight, I was happy with that but it was not a business class flight. I have paid for a business class flight so I expect to be put on a business class flight. Staff at the transfer counter could not give a dam about it, just rolled their eyes and said oh well. I asked for a refund and the lady handed me the telephone of which there was a long wait to talk to an Air New Zealand staff member for my refund. I hung up and then asked to speak to the manager who told me that I could get a refund at the ticketing office in the departures hall or by submitting a email. I then had to proceed back the other way though immigration and customs to the check in terminal and book a business class flight on QF so I could get back to Sydney. I managed to get a flight immediately and I paid full fare for the flight. Under advice from the manager at the transfer desk I then proceeded to the ticket office to get a refund. I was then told that this could not be done and I had to ring up. Emailed the Air New Zealand executive teams personal emails with a complaint over a week ago and still have not heard anything back. Will never use this airline again.",0
Delays for hours not minutes. The delay caused us to be very late arriving in Detroit. There is no savings in this airline whatsoever. Please do yourselves a favor and read reviews before you book a flight. I wish I had! The reviews are spot on. ,0
Terrible Airline. Not a single flight I have taken with them has left on time. Their website accepts payment and then fails to verify so I had to contact my bank. Customer service is terrible. Overall I would not recommend them. Rather fly Vietnam Airlines.,0
Athens to Hamburg. Overall a very bad experience. We boarded the aircraft for the flight to Hamburg through a jetway and while taxiing they told us that there is a problem and we had to change aircraft. We were waiting inside the aircraft without any other information and about an hour later we were asked to deplane to a bus and then board another aircraft through a boarding ramp.  Aegean could have used a jetway to avoid this hassle and they should have better informed us about the expected delay. We arrived at Hamburg delayed by at least 2 hours and no apology throughout the flight. All staff behaved as if nothing had happened. My family missed their train connections and had to pay for new expensive tickets.,0
"Austrian cancelled or delayed flights to Frankfurt, however on the same day most flights from other companies landed and started in Innsbruck. At the time of check in, no Information from the staff was given. Most officials who are appointed at counters in Innsbruck appear completely disinterested and show no motivation. Questions about the reasons for delay could not be answered. Then several wrong Information about actual departing time were given. At the time of boarding, no Information about connections in Frankfurt could be provided. When this was mentioned in the aircraft to purser, she suggested to contact ground staff. 30 minutes after boarding, the flight was cancelled and passengers returned to the main hall. There was no organized rebooking so that the passengers without priority were served first. Even after 100 minutes waiting, there was absolutely no progress for most urgent connections.  For flights from and to INN, this airline should be avoided because of poor ground operation service.",0
Lima to Salt Lake City via Dallas. Leaving Lima the plane was late 1.5 hrs. We all get that happens. But the airline made no attempt to make up time in the air over this 8 hour flight. The flight attendant lied about letting us deboard first so we could make our next flights. Every single employee along this journey was not only not helpful they were rude and seemed annoyed with us attempting to make connecting flights. They didnt care in the least. Never ever American again.,0
Delhi to Toronto. With a seat pitch of 31 inches this plane is not suitable for long flights. Seats are uncomfortable due to width and minimal recline. Flight was delay many times. Service was average what equipment was not suitable for long journey.,0
"A very old aircraft. I got moved twice because the seat buttons were not working. The seats were very uncomfortable. The tv screen was hazy and unclear. Entertainment was limited to 5 English movies! The map route was not available and the vegetarian breakfast was disgusting. No flavor. The captain came on the speakers twice, at departure and arrival. Most announce the altitude and give a few details of how the route will be.",0
"From Fuerteventura to Dusseldorf on TUIfly, I was returning home after a short holiday in January with my wife and children. Check in was messed up and the staff at the airport don't understand German or English.  Boarding the plane was chaos as the crew did not greet people as normal. The plane was new and the seats was not comfortable. The crew was not helpful. There is no food and beverages as well as entertainment onboard even. I will never fly with TUIfly again.",0
"Bad service, bad planes, bad organization, bad Webpage and bad customer service. I've tried to buy a flight 3 times, and it doesn't work. I also have call them to solve the problems, and it was impossible. Finally I bought a flight with another company. I won't use Cebu Pacific any more.",0
Sydney to Singapore 27th July 2013 SQ232 and returned 13th August 2013 on SQ211. Outbound flight was good on the A380. Attendants robotic but efficient nonetheless even though they took their time responding to request buttons. Seats aren't the worst but not the best. Recline was good seat pitch not so much. I enjoyed the meals on this flight especially the Western steak cooked perfectly. Nothing too troublesome. The return leg however was very disappointing on a tattered B777 aircraft. Seats were extremely uncomfortable with small recline and an industry standard 32 inch seat pitch. Crew were far less attentive than the first leg. It took different crew trying to ask for some basic toiletries or a glass of water. Seat back TV's were tiny and intermittently froze throughout the flights. Overall whilst the first flight was above average the return was far from acceptable.,0
"First of they attributed to me and my husband 2 seat, each one at the opposite of the plane. We had to wait plenty of time for luggage drop. I am traveling all over the world with my camera and lenses in my backpack and a trolley containing all important stuff like medicines and so. Especially in these times when luggage are more than sometimes lost. Today was the first time they ask money to send my trolley.... I really hope it will land with me. Also the staff even didn't try to help or to be comprehensive. And of course there was no responsible person to talk to. And no time was left. So we had to pay. I think it is unacceptable. Even the Stewardess was not a nice person. When the company is not positive, everything is bad. I will never travel with them again.",0
"I had flown just yesterday. I was early, the line was ridiculous so I sent my 2 daughters to go shopping and stayed with my son. We all ate and come to find out our plane was delayed until 12 so we waited, then our gate changed and was delayed 2 more hours. They boarded us and all my children had to sit alone away from me. My daughter was only 12 and was crying the whole flight. Never flying southwest ever again.",0
"Hartford to Orlando. I will never fly Southwest again, they do not care at all about customers. My flight was cancelled only 4 hours before it was scheduled leave. When I called to see why it was cancelled they said they had no idea. I was flying down to visit family for only 3 days, and I took off work.  They changed my flight to a 5am trip so now I had to wake up at 2am to get to the airport. When I called Southwest they said that they couldn't do anything for me that it was not their fault or their responsibility. I wasn't asking for my money back I just wanted some type of compensation for my inconvenience.",0
"The worst experience I have ever had! The app is horrible and faulty, I could never get my miles and smiles rewards number to work and no one to help me, they lost my luggage and the phone number given to me did not work. After many calls the rep on the phone said they couldn't help me and the system was not updated. They rerouted my flight and never gave me a ticket to my destination and I had to pay for an additional ticket from a different airline. Again the customer service agent in Istanbul told me he did not know what to do, and told me to call a number in the USA that didn't work.  The seating arrangements were messed up with multiple people having the same seats. Not one person who works for this airline could ever give me any information. All the answers were answered with ""I don't know"". I still don't have my bag after they said they found it and would send me a tracking number.",0
Flew with family to New Zealand from Heathrow into Kuala Lumpur and then onto Auckland. Return journey was Auckland to Kuala Lumpur and then to Schipol. Flights were on time allowing ample time for making connecting flights. Staff were very friendly and helpful and worked tirelessly on these long haul flights As with a lot of airlines economy class seating is not the most comfortable but you get what you pay for. The food was very good and the vegetarian option which I had was varied throughout the journeys. Couldn't fault the inflight entertainment which provided excellent selections of current movies and old favourite TV programmes. All in all a very pleasant experience.,1
"Delhi to Dubai. Extremely old plane, hard uncomfortable, poorly reclining seats in business class, dirty cabin and seats, very bad, inedible food, no entertainment system, untrained cabin crew. Felt like I was travelling on a budget airline as opposed to a full service airline in business class.",0
"Winnipeg to Toronto. When i got to the airport and went to check in, the lady at the counter had already left. A person from another airline said she had left an hour before. Due to her not being there i couldn't get my boarding pass and couldn't get on the plane. I had to pay for a new ticket. I chose this airline because it was the cheapest. Had i known this i could've paid a bit more and fly with a more reputable airline.",0
Denver to Orlando. Frontier is the worst airline ever. After an extremely bumpy and sloppy flight that was almost an hour late we were still waiting for our luggage an hour after we arrived! I am still waiting now for our luggage at 9pm at night. There are about 300 other people standing here waiting as well. No excuse for such a poor operation. Not worth the savings at all!,0
The flight was delayed an hour. The snacks and drinks on flight were not available. We sat on runway after landing for over 30 mins and now waiting for baggage for almost an hour. Flights that have landed after us have gotten their baggage. No communication from the airline. Terrible! It is worth paying a little more for an other airline.,0
"My husband flies with you all the time for business. You stopped a flight, lied about weather while he sat on the plane for 4.5 hours that never took off. He has a bad back and is now suffering. He had to stay in California overnight. Our kids were just crushed. You gave zero apology. You are a 3 star airline for a reason.",0
I am sitting in a hotel room on Christmas Eve eating Chinese food due to the fact that two hours before departure Spirit cancelled the flight from ACY to RSW. They could not book anyone on another flight to Florida because they were apparently already booked solid for the next week. I have been a loyal Spirit customer in the past but will never fly with them again. Cancelling a flight on short notice Christmas eve is simply unconscionable.,0
Toronto Pearson to Bridgetown with WestJet Airlines. Surly and very unhelpful lady at the counter and equally unhelpful on board staff. Did these people take a course on how not to smile when refusing to help with my bag? Never again.,0
"Merimbula to Melbourne. The reception guy was extremely  rude with no customer service at all. We are from Western Australia but our luggage, instead of Melbourne residers', was picked out to be not coming back with us from Merimbula to Melbourne, due to weather condition. I missed out the announcement because I was outside of the waiting room. The guy at the reception at Merimbula did not have any empathy, or patience to explain the situation but rush and threaten me if I don't do as he said quickly he will let the pilot know to depart without me. The most frustrating day and the worst customer service I have ever encountered in my life.",0
"Instead of being at my home with my family in Greece celebrating orthodox Easter, I am in hotel in Chicago. Our flight was delayed multiple times until it was cancelled, there was no warning, we just had to waste 8 hours at the airport until American Airlines admitted they could not staff the flight. They send us to a hotel in the middle of nowhere. After such a long day I can't even have a drink or smoke a cigarette.",0
I flew Newark to Copenhagen to Venice. Once I arrived in Venice my luggage did not show up. I went to the baggage claim and there were at least 10 others in line who also lost their luggage and we discovered that they all started in Newark too. Most of the people in line were leaving for a cruise the next morning. The baggage claim said we would get our bags in two days. After the two days were up I tried calling every hour when I finally got a hold of someone they were very unhelpful and just told me to check the website. They didn't even locate my bag until 4 days after my trip. And even after they located my bag I didn't get it for another 3 days. This airline ruined my vacation. The staff on the plane were very friendly though and the food wasn't that bad. Inflight Entertainment was terrible.,0
"I was looking for an alternative to Etihad, with its high fares and declining service. The extra 2 hours via Doha were not an issue, considering the much lower fare, the great spanking new A350, great service and food and free German rail ticket, which is included in the ticket price. ",1
"San Francisco to Wuhan. Staff on the ground were pretty friendly, except one was rude and kept yelling when we were claiming our duty free products. Crew on the plane are friendly and the service is quite good.  The food on the plane is better than other airlines I travelled with, and the crew served very well. The seats were 180 degree flat, it was a nice sleep for me.",1
Kuwait Airways is by far the worst airline I have travelled. Our flight was delayed 45 minutes taking off from Colombo and arrived 20 minutes later than our connecting flight. The connecting flight to New York had taken off without waiting for passengers. The support given by the ground staff was next to nil and there was no alternative provided. Ground staff were very rude. we were asked to stay 24 hours for the next flight that they were 'sorry' they were not able to help anymore. We were sent to a hotel near the airport. No facilities provided to make calls outside to inform our family of the delay and to make alternative arrangements as we had to cancel and make new reservations for flight and hotel. The Kuwait airways rates are low which makes this an attractive option but the hassle this airlines puts you and the lack of support or service is not worth that cost. I would never fly Kuwait Airways.,0
Business Class SYD LAX via BNE. Amazing service and great aircraft. Connecting through BNE is a pain especially with the direct service from SYD but not a hassle and the earlier arrival time at LAX worked better for me. Great value for money I would fly them over Qantas United or Delta on the same route.,1
Wow is one of the friendliest airlines I have ever flown with. Everything was straight forward from the check in to the flight itself. I have never experienced such friendly and up beat staff for the whole flight. It really doesn't feel like a low cost airline!,1
"My jewel among low cost airlines. Courteous, efficient and highly safety oriented cabin crew. Very enjoyable flying experience thru out. Every time the washroom had been used the crew checked it for cleanliness. Great public announcements.",1
"Worst experience ever. At Lisbon we were told that our flight was cancelled and was moved to the following day. Instead of providing vouchers for hotel accommodations and meals they told us to pay from our pockets and assured us that we would get reimbursed. Dealing with United Airlines customer service is a nightmare. This cancellation took place in August 2022 today is October 19, 2022 and I'm still waiting to be reimbursed for the extra costs of staying one more night in Lisbon. United Airlines has little respect for his customer's time. Please avoid United Airlines at all costs.",0
"The day started early but great. The whole family was going to Cancun. The fun stopped very early at the Airport with a gate change that soon lead to flight delay. Setting with a family of 8 we held our own and was excited to hear the crew had arrived to check the plane. An hour and a half goes by and still no word. People around us also started wondering, then we hear another announcement that the crew has arrived and are checking the plane. This leads to another hour delay until it was announced that the flight was canceled. When I asked why, I was told the crew never showed up. We rushed to gate to get a refund and change airlines. That was a whole other problem of an unorganized department of Spirit. They had police waiting because they knew flight was going to be cancelled and people were going to be upset. I saw trash outside where it had been dumped by ground crew and our luggage was never placed onto the plane, but was left out in the rain. Never saw one ground crew or the inside of the plane",0
"I flew with AirAsia twice this month, 1st from Penang to Langkawi, and then from Langkawi to Kuala Lampur, and both were top quality flights. The 1st flight arrived at the destination even earlier than the stated time, and the 2nd one was punctual as well, their cabin crew are all professional, well dressed, respectful and beautiful too! unlike Malaysian Airlines staff which were disrespectful and not good looking, If you're looking for domestic flights within Malaysia, they're the best option to choose imo, don't let the negative reviews scare you away, I bought one 25kg luggage and when I weighed it at the airport, it was 2 kg above that but still they said it was fine and didn't charge anything extra for it.",1
"Singapore to Surabaya. I always fly Singapore airlines for work, and it has been getting worse by the day. The flight is perpetually delayed. It seems like they do not have a good concept of punctuality. In addition, cabin crew are average in terms of service and pleasantness. the hard product in itself is not something to be lauded. However, among all of it, it has always been the late departure over and over is the one that I think is the biggest pain.",0
Took Spirit from LGA to Myrtle beach SC. On coming back got to the airport at 9am flight was for 12.30pm. They kept us in the airport until 11 pm and then decided to cancel the flight. They have no flights for another 4 days. I had to drive from SC to New York on a rented car. I will never take Spirit again. The customer service is the worst in the whole industry. They are rude unprofessional and disorganized. Yes refund was issued for the cancelled flight but nothing said about the inconveniences. They charged for everything even your little carryon.,0
"I have used Spirit Airlines several times and I have always been disappointed, they will delay your flight for no reason, and if they delay it, they end up not having an available flight that you can board once you are delayed, they will give you a choice of either waiting more than 6 hrs or your refund back, meaning you are basically stuck and stranded. If you don't have extra funds to book another airline if you have an emergency, you end up being stuck at that airport. I have heard enough disappointments with spirit airlines that I would advice anyone to use spirit.Please my advice to anyone out there is that do not use spirit airline,choose another airline besides spirit airlines. You get what you pay for, the service, the crew not pleasant.",0
"After the 50 passengers were cramped into the shuttle bus, we were told the pilot requested mechanics to deal with a technical issue and we would have to wait a ""couple of minutes"". 10 min later, with doors closed it was hard to breath. The driver cranked the AC to full blast and opened the doors and now we were freezing. After 30 min standing in a cold, packed bus, we were told we would go back to the terminal. Another 10 min later the issue was solved by an off duty mechanic, and we were lucky to be on our way. In short, it was disrespectful, and a health hazard experience.",0
"Flew Detroit to LaGuardia. This is again an example of cattle transport. Delta had old planes. This one really looked like it was ready for the junk yard. Again, at Delta you get nothing. The seats are totally uncomfortable as well. I was happy to land in New York and have this experience behind me.",0
"BookED with Sunwing 3 months in advance FROM Montreal to Fort Lauderdale, documents indicated that baggage was included. Sunwing changed its baggage policy and tried to charge everyone. After a fuss the supervisor gave in and we were not charged. The problem was everyone was delayed because of Sunwing trying to make a few extra bucks. The plane was delayed one hour because of the passengers being held up because Sunwing was trying to collect baggage fees and everyone wasted an hour of vacation siting on the plane waiting for passengers. Substandard airline.",0
"Hamburg to Athens. Aegean Airline is one of the best airlines in Europe. The staff is very friendly and helps, if you have any questions or problems. The airplane was clean and in a very good condition. The food in the Business Class was very tasty. The variety of drinks is also very good. Everyone, who fly to Greece, must try Aegean Airlines!",1
"Quick check in, followed by efficient and punctual boarding. Buses in great condition. Newer aircrafts. Smiling and professional cabin crew. Captains update passengers regularly with clear announcements. Although it is a low cost carrier, a bit more cushioning on seats would be great. All in all, highly recommended, at least for Indian domestic sector.",1
"London to Kathmandu via Doha. I enjoyed my flight with Qatar Airways. Cabin crew was very professional and friendly, food and drinks was brilliant. I would like to say keep it up guys and thanks a lot for your hospitality.",1
"It was a good experience in Alitalia  business class flight from Mexico to Rome. The lounge in Mexico City Airport was very large, comfortable armchairs to relax, super buffet and well stocked. Very friendly staff. Onboard the crew were caring for passengers and available. The menu with good selection of drinks, good and abundant during the whole flight. Comfortable seats, nice toiletries and many films made this a very positive experience.  E' stata una bella esperienza questo volo in business con Alitalia dal messico a roma. Il lounge riservato a citta del messico e' molto ampio, comode poltrone per rilassarsi, abbondante buffet super rifornito. Molto gentile il personale sempre s disposizione. In aereo il personale di bordo si e' dimostato attento ai passeggeri e a disposizione. Il menu con ottima scelta di bevande tra un cui un ottimo ferrari e' molto buono ed abbondante durante tutto il volo. Comode poltrone letto e bel kit cortesia e tanti film,allietano il viaggio. Esperienza molto positiva.",1
"I had the worst flying experience ever. We had to leave the aircraft 4 hours after boarding due to technical issue. We were then sent home with no updates. We received an email 12 hours after our original boarding time saying that the flight was rescheduled for 6 pm, 18 hours after our original boarding time. We ended up having 9 hours wait time in KL airport for our connecting flight over night and we were not even provided with accommodation. We are now sitting at airport waiting to board our flight to Kota Kinabalu and it has been already delayed by one hour. This airline is a joke. During the flight our meal option was only scrambled egg for dinner.",0
Having taken several domestic flights to London Heathrow and back to Newcastle I can understand why BA have recently announced extra flights on this route. All flights full yet all credit to cabin crews who managed to supply a full trolley service. Flight and cabin crews all to a high standard of service with plenty of meaningful announcements. Can't praise enough.,1
"Out of the latest 10 times I had to fly with Cebu Pacific, 9 of them had at least 1 hour delay. The staff constantly makes updates with delay after delay and you always hear the same thing ""out of airline control"". When you are delayed to for example Manila and you see Air Asia and PAL flying on time with ease and you had the bad taste by choosing Cebu Pathetic and will sit through delay and delay, lost bags, incompetent staff and dirty airplanes.  I have given Cebu Pacific chance after chance and ironically they always state after a delay ""We hope we can make it up to you on your next flight"".  Last time flying with Cebu Pacific and will rather pay higher prices.",0
The worst airline ever! They change the flight time and do not even inform you! And then they charge you for a flight change if the new time does not suit you! I was on waiting line for two hours and they kept on hanging up on me! I do not recommend for anyone. Not worth it!,0
Singapore to Sydney via Kuala Lumpur. We travel annually on Malaysia Airlines to Europe. This was our homeward leg. The airline has had its difficulties and has been restructured. If anything service and food are even better. Downside is that many routes have been dropped including KUL to Brisbane. This means we now must fly out of and into Sydney which adds five hours to the trip. Seat becomes an angled bed. This to change I believe early next year to a flat bed.,1
"Verona to Samarkand via Moscow. Avoid this company at all costs. My first flight was delayed more then 2 hours and I lost my connection in the process. I was diverted to TAS the following morning after a whole night spent at Moscow DME airport, and the company refused to arrange and pay for the ground transport between TAS and SKD. A baggage was lost in the process and recovered only after a week. Finally, it is not possible to contact the company for complaints and refunds, as they accept only written complaints sent by ordinary mail to an address in the middle of Russia. Such a company should be banned to fly inside the EU.",0
Airport staff and inflight services excellent. Food is very good quality. Due to schedules our return flight to UK had a 9 hr stopover in Incheon but were compensated by very good airport facilities.,1
9th December from Krasnodar to Moscow Sheremetyevo on Flight SU 1103 and missed the connection to Flight SU 263 to London Heathrow. I flew yesterday on Aeroflot and experienced delays and missed connection through no fault of Aeroflot. I was dealt with by their many ground staff at Sheremetyevo extremely well the plane was modern and well flown and I would strongly recommend them for the service I received. Full marks and strongly recommended.,1
From Calgary airport to Frankfurt. I was impressed by the good service and looking forward to use Condor again. Very good service for a good price! They are on a good way to become a 4 star airline just a few improvements.,1
"This is the first and also the last time I fly KLM I have 2 pieces of carryon. Did not know KLM policy of 12 kg total for carry on. At KLM ticketing, they did not tell us. And then made us check in the luggage at the gate. They profiled people, my friends. I saw others just went through with 2 pieces of luggage, looked heavier than mine. Be careful if you book KLM. I usually flew Delta and got shuttles to KLM and did not realize. KLM you fooled me once but not twice. I will never fly on KLM again.",0
"Houston to Grand Rapids. The personnel was rude, disrespectful, and treated me as if I was wrong. I had clearance for my carry on. But at the gate they made me go and check my bag. Would not let me remove my items. It was an enormous inconvenience. All the money we paid for the flight and this is how your customers are treated.",0
"Great flight from Athens to Paris. The ground staff were very professional and nice. Aboard the plane, the flight attendants were also very nice and provided us with many drinks and snacks all throughout the flight. The seats were very comfortable. There were absolutely no delays, and our checked bags were retrieved without any problem. The flight itself was spectacular, with a wonderful sunset above Croatia, the Mediterranean and the Alps. I would say this flight comfirms my view of Air France as an affordable and very reliable airline.",1
Flew with Ryanir EDI to POZ KRK to RYG and RYG to EDI. All flights were on time with clean aircraft and attentive crew. I know you only get what you pay for but my family and I fly Ryanair regularly to visit family in Poland and I have never had cause to moan grumble or complain in over 30 flights. Make sure your bag is the right size and weight print your boarding passes or use the new app and turn up on time.,1
"Toronto to Guangzhou. The crew were excellent and I would recommend China Southern. The seat was comfortable and the inflight entertainment was good. Touch screen with new movie and many games, the food taste good.",1
"Recent flight on Air Canada rouge was terrible. The seats were so uncomfortable and narrow. The ""new"" entertainment they couldn't get working. This flight was terrible and unfortunately I have three more flights booked with them. My mother was in Premium Rouge and the seats weren't much wider and yet they charge hundreds more. My advise is don't waste your money. Pick another option any option is better than Air Canada rouge.",0
I booked with Qantas frequent flyer points on the Qantas site and received all Qantas conditions etc. I went to the Qantas counter in Brisbane and was told I was to go down to Jetstar because it was a JQ number I was flying Jetstar? I had just driven to Brisbane as Qantas do not go to the Sunshine Coast. When I arrived at Jetstar there was just one girl attending to the baggage drop. I was eventually given my boarding pass and allocated seat 17. The Jetstar representative checking the cabin luggage was very officious. I lined up and the representative said to weigh my handbag computer and fascinator for the Cup the fascinator weighed nothing the total weight was well under 10kgs. The fascinator was damaged during this process. I asked if I could just carry the fascinator on board then she said you can only have 2 bags. I said the hat weighs nothing though. She said well put the hat on your head! I then boarded the plane and by the time the food arrived the air hostess said there was nothing left and I had to go without a decent lunch. Prior to boarding the plane there were four people near me who swore they would not fly with Jetstar again. I was very disappointed overall and definitely believe you have issues that need to be addressed.,0
"This airline is terrible. After a 6.5 hour delay and counting, I need my medication from my checked bag. I guess since we're so late and they can't get my bad with medication, I will have to suffer. I just want to go home at this point after 8 hours in this airport.",0
"Daytime flight. The best cabin service I have experienced in years, including much better service than other airlines in business class. Great IFE, plenty of movies. Non stop cabin crew attention, good main meals, plenty of snacks and drinks available throughout the entire flight. Nothing but praise for this airline. Cabin crew to be praised.",1
"Smooth flight, on time and big surprise was free refreshment for this less than hour local flight. Crew was nice. And there was a good legroom.",1
"Worst customer service at the boarding area, personnel on boarding gate are so rude, needs to be thought good manners, doesn't even ask nicely and demanding, from the person who demanded to check in the luggage, he said he is the supervisor. The one in the counter just threw the passport instead of handling it. The lady on the gate shouted to not to be in the way. No one is smiling.",0
My wife and I were booked on Delta flight 7 leaving Dubai at 9.45 pm. There was a mechanical problem with the plane these things happen. We were advised to go wait in a nearby Business Class lounge and wait for an announcement which never occurred. I walked back to the gate only to then discover that the flight had been cancelled and no announcement had been made the gate agent even admitted this. The rebooking was a nightmare we finally left Dubai two days later and had to endure the same rude gate agents who were more concerned with talking on their cell phones and playing around than taking care of the customers. Most of the agents did not speak even a small amount of English they were not organized and clearly not professionals. I have flown with Delta for over 11 years this is the worst experience I have ever had.,0
"Hong Kong to London. Ground service was smooth and efficient. Though the gate was a bit far away from the immigration, the check in counter was very quick. The seat was modern and they provided a wide range of movies and TV shows in the IFE system. Two meals were served and snacks including cup noodles were served in between. Desserts were also served in the economy class. I could get my check in luggage swiftly and reached central London in an hour.",1
"Austin to Washington Dulles. Arrived at 11am for my 1245 flight. As soon as I got through security I got a text that my flight was delayed 1 hour. Went to the gate to board and we got on the plane, sat there for an hour and then were told we had to get off and the flight was delayed until 5pm. At 5 we all showed up at the gate and the airport screen said flight was canceled. The ladies at the desk said they didn't know and no one got email,or texts. After a while they confirmed it was canceled and they could rebook or refund the tickets. Next flight is in 5 days. I'm trying to get to a conference that will be concluding before I can get there. They claimed this was due to weather. There were three other flights to the same location that took off from the airport that day. I also know that the airport I was going to was landing flights all day. It was not the weather. Also, because it was canceled due to weather we don't get any compensation. So I'm paying for a hotel that I'm not at.",0
"London to Melbourne via Abu Dhabi with Etihad Airways in business class. The duration of flight was fine, no problem. However 3 out of 4 bags were left in Abu Dhabi, one of which we thought was lost. The customer service afterwards was extremely uncaring and disgusting. The complaints procedure was diabolical to the extent that our emails were ignored and the final outcome was unsatisfactory. We are extremely distressed by what has happened and can find no excuse for their attitude. We flew business class, which we struggle to do financially but, because of our age it is necessary, and one woud expect exemplary service. The shortfall was enormous.",0
"Guangzhou to Auckland. I upgraded to first class on the ground with my grandmother. The flight attendant greeted us with great enthusiasm. First class is very quiet and comfortable and I had a good rest. The flight attendant woke me up before landing and served a good breakfast. After landing, the attendant helped us arrange the wheelchair service for my grandma.",1
"Mumbai to Seoul Incheon with Korean Air, Flight was in time, and the food served during flight is very delicious. Excellent service provided by cabin crew and I found the ground service is the best. Good inflight entertainment.",1
Went to Turkey in September and really enjoyed the flight. Surprised how much legroom there was. The flight crew were pleasant and helpful. The check in at Leeds Bradford was very good as was the boarding.,1
"Thank you Qatar for trying to make the trip secure and enjoyable. Although flight was full from KTM to Doha, Doha to IAD, passengers were spaced nicely. Pricing mask and Face shield in Kathmandu was reassuring. Service was excellent, as always. Despite ticket being cancelled twice before our flight, because it was not Qatar Airways fault, I am very happy with your service.",1
"I am writing this review because the experience that I have had with American Airlines in the past two days is honestly unbelievable. My daughter is a minor and was flying back from Anchorage to Myrtle Beach on November 2, 2022. When she arrived at the airport for check in they sent her to the gate with the app on her cell phone for boarding. She is an unaccompanied minor which I paid extra for so you cannot use the app for boarding. That was their first mistake because by the time she went back to the desk she ended up missing her flight. Because of that she did not return to Myrtle Beach when she was supposed to. She had to be put on a flight for the next night which was extremely inconvenient especially because of her school. She then leaves Anchorage on the next flight which was the next night and when she arrives in Dallas she has no unaccompanied minor tag or chaperone. When I find this out I go straight to the Myrtle Beach airport to find out why my child is alone in Dallas. In the process she finds someone and ask about her chaperone and she is told that she is not on a list for a chaperone. A lady sits with her anyway but tells her that she will probably not have a chaperone when she gets to Charlotte. While I am at Myrtle Beach airport I find out that Anchorage airport put my child on the plane and did not list her as an unaccompanied minor so she was not chaperoned. I wasted my entire morning at Myrtle Beach airport trying to make sure that my child was safe and would make it back to Myrtle Beach because she still had another connecting flight. I am making this review to make anyone aware that has a minor child to possibly find another airline because this is the most unacceptable thing that I have ever had to deal with. I am extremely unhappy with this entire situation and I can say that if nothing else the one mistake that an airline should never make is not having a chaperone available for a minor that has three different flights. When booking this flight I was assured multiple times that my child would not be alone and that was not the case. Once again this whole situation has been absolutely unbelievable. I pray that no parent ever has to experience the stress that I have with this airline.",0
Our flight was delayed from Los Angeles to New York where we had a connecting flight to Birmingham. The staff on the plane were aware of this and were fantastic and arranged for us to go to the front of the plane once we had landed in New York so that we could get off it first and the staff had also advised all the other passengers via an announcement to let us go to the front. We made the next flight with minutes to spare and although our luggage never made it with us it was delivered to our house the next day and we therefore had a very efficient experience with American Airlines.,1
"Beijing to Calgary. I was having a fever when I was taking the flight HU7977, the Cabin Manager and the Purser were very professional and provided the best services they could to ensure the resting environment was comfortable for me since I felt so uncomfortable.",1
"Marseille to Boston via Madrid. Absolutely horrible customer service. Both during check in and while talking to customer service on the phone. At check in they did not allow me to check in due to covid testing policies, even though I had my test scheduled at my stop in Madrid, where they did not require a PCR. The lady forced me to call Iberia to try and find another flight back, and when I did they kept me on hold for more than an hour, and so I had to search for a flight back home on my own. When I called to ask for a refund they did not say anything more than that their system does not allow them to process a refund and would not let me speak to another representative. It was honestly just a very big waste if money for a returning flight I never attended or was helped to find another, and never refunded. Save yourself money and stress DO NOT, book with Iberia.",0
Very bad flight experience. Though I was booked in Business Class the seats and taking care of food preference was horrible. My in seat entertainment system was not working. Also on top of it the control to call the attendant was not working. Even the reading light on the seat was not working for a major portion of the flight I could not read anything. I had in advance booked an Asian Vegetarian meal. I was informed that the meal had not been arranged. My seat was moving I was not sure that the seat was fully in upright position at the time of take off and landing.,0
"Nouakchott to Paris. Really really bad. Old plane, no hot water in business class. The entertainment was awful, you couldn't see a movie properly, it was blurred and the screen were so small. Meals were good but overcooked. The only positive thing was the professionalism of the cabin staff.",0
"Tri Cities to Orlando Sanford. On the last 5 times myself or a family member has flown Allegiant, the flight has been delayed at least 2 hours for mechanical problems. I believe the convenience of flying out of tri cities is no longer a viable option and my family and friends will be going to Charlotte to my make our trips to Florida.",0
"Ho Chi Minh City to Zurich. We booked this flight with Swiss but we actually flew with Edelweiss. Unfortunately, this airline is not a good one for long haul flights. The legroom was horribly inadequate and the whole flight was uncomfortable. We asked to be in seats with more legroom and offered to pay for this, but they said these sits are reserved for families with kids. In the airplane I saw plenty of people half my size sitting at those sits with extra room, so clearly they did not tell us the truth. Also, the food served was very poor, especially the breakfast. They also wanted to charge 8 swiss francs for a serving of wine. The ticket price was normal, so I would expect to at least get some drinks included. For anyone who flew with an Asian airline for a long distance trip, Edelweiss is simply bad. I would avoid Edelweiss for any long haul flights and would only use for short distance flights.",0
Philadelphia to Washington with American Airlines. Worst service ever! They cancelled our flight and could not put us on another flight for two days. Then I had to wait 2 hours for my luggage to be taken off a plane that I wasn't even on! I would not recommend this airline to anyone. Their customer service was very rude and not helpful. We finally gave up and decided to drive 10 hours to our destination because they couldn't do anything for us.,0
"Honolulu to San Francisco. The boarding crew were disrespectful and didn't care about your seating. Very awful manner and flight would get delayed! There was a mother who wanted to seat next to her 2 year old baby, the flight attendants instead of seating them they yelled at the mother!",0
My time on Alaska airlines was ok. I was flying from Sacramento California to Seattle Washington. The flight attendants were nice and cheerful. The flight left on time and the flight attendants gave us a bag of beef jerky for the inflight meals. We ended up landing about 10 minutes early and the only thing I recommend is that they add inflight entertainment otherwise I recommend that you fly with Alaska.,1
"I have a flight booked for today from Managua to Baltimore. There's one stop in Fort Lauderdale, but the arrival time is the exact time as boarding to the connecting flight. Seems doable on paper, but they don't tell you have to get your luggage and recheck your bag again. We obviously missed our flight along with 20 other passengers with similar flights. Maybe you think that this was just a one time hiccup but friend of mine booked the exact same flights the week before and missed his flight. The redirected flight went through Orlando, same as mine. They obviously do this often, and I've come to the conclusion that they do this knowing very well that you will miss your flight! They offered me nothing.",0
Flair Airlines have to be the worst when it comes to customer service in Vancouver location. They spend more time talking to each other. Trying to charge us extra fees for a shopping bag with food in it and fishing rods which we had no problem boarding the plane to Vancouver. But couldn't board the fight to Ottawa because we didn't want to pay for a shopping bag with my purse and food in it. So we missed our flight because of this.,0
I have taken 2 trips to Phuket in the last 6 months flying AirAsia from the Gold Coast I found them to be an excellent airline they always left on time and arrived on or before the advertised arrival time the cabin crew are great and the food was not bad either the in flight entertainment was ok. They had the shortest travel times from all the airlines that fly to Phuket and the best prices.,1
"Worst experience ever. They kept changing the flight time, we had to over go a delay of one hour and when we finally got to the airport we waited for an extra one hour because there was another plane in our spot. Not recommended.",0
"Very pleasant flight with KLM. Efficient boarding procedure and aircraft clean and well maintained. Cabin crew very friendly and chatty and obviously enjoying their job. A small snack box containing a sandwich, cookie and water were served along with a muffin and a choice of hot and cold drinks. Flight arrived 20 minutes ahead of schedule.",1
"Kaohsiung to Singapore. We would like to thank the captain and cabin crew of TR287 on 19 Aug that they provided assistance to my husband who was not feeling well after landing. Cabin crew attended to us promptly. They provided him with blanket and water to keep him warm and secured him on a wheelchair in order to transfer him out from the aircraft to the airport terminal. The captain and crew even helped to carry my luggages all the way.  Without their kind help and teamwork, we couldn't be able to arrive home safely. We're very touched by thier kind concerns and professional assistance! Thank you.",1
"We were traveling with 3 children ages 7,2,and 6 months and anyone who travels with children know you make plans around their age. We booked a flight to Cancun and Spirit changed our dates of our flight plans. We felt now we were in a huge bind because changes to flight plans we had to adapt to change our hotels, rental cars, prepaid plans etc. We would have to pay a ton more money to make the changes and the cheapest method was to pay the cancelation policies to our resorts, rental cars, and online shows we already purchased to Cancun. It cost us a ton to cancel. The frustrating thing is we decided to take an airline credit because fighting with them over reimbursed flight money made it unbearable. We decide to use our airline credit on A Friday head to San Pedro Sula and arrive on a Friday direct from Vegas through Houston. We wanted to ferry to Roatan and enjoy our vacation in the Caribbean. We booked our hotels, paid for our Ferry ride and rental cars etc according to the flight and when we were arriving. They now changed our flight Day again from Friday to Thursday to DTW, then fly another leg to FLL then arrive to SPS. We would have to not only change all our hotels, rental cars, prepaid ferry rides but we are now having to take young children an extra legs, take an extra day off work, and haul them around for 3 days through airports and hotels before we even get to our Destination.",0
"Orlando to Raleigh. It was my first experience with not only the Sanford airport, but Allegiant Air as well. I wanted to say what a great experience we had, our flight attendant went above and beyond to make sure that we enjoyed our experience. She was very knowledgeable in training us with the exit row duties. It was a rather short flight so she really didn't have to check on us the way she did but we really appreciated her extra kindness.",1
"Toronto to Edmonton. I missed my flight due to delay in immigration procedure and the staff at immigration mentioned that Air Canada will arrange another flight, but they didn't arrange anything and they told to buy a new ticket.",0
DMK to CEI and back 6 days later. Schedule changed after booking but was informed by email and given different options. Check in and boarding quick and organised. Planes clean and in good shape. Free snack and water. Smiles all over and on time arrivals. What would you want more?,1
New York JFK to Grand Cayman. Don't even think about flying Cayman Airways until the Max 8 are back in the air. They are currently flying a schedule that they can't possibly make and the delays are long! No TV's or WIFI available.,0
"Flew Vueling from Munich to Barcelona. The most horrible airline. Extremely high flight cancellation chance. Once your flight is cancelled, you will receive no notification. I found it out by opening the app 2 days before and saw the info within the app. It automatically selected their cheapest available flight on a different day by default. Thanks to this great airline, I had to leave my vacation earlier than planned, getting much lesser value for my trip. You think you might be saving some money choosing this airline? Promise you, you will regret it.",0
The worst economy seats I have ever travelled on! My husband and I are not enormous people and we literally could have used a lubricant to 'squeeze' into our seats! We made sure we had the bulkhead seats for extra leg room as hubby is 6 foot 3 inches tall but unfortunately this meant the seats were minuscule. Most uncomfortable 31 hours ever spent on an airline. Staff were inattentive and we watched a single mum struggle to get her meal eaten with no help from the cabin staff at all. Other passengers had to assist her! The cleanliness of the cabin left a lot to be desired. On our return journey we upgraded to premium economy but were place right beside the toilets! The cabin staff allowed economy passengers as well as premium economy passengers to use them so there was a constant stream of noise all night long! All together a very disappointing trip with Virgin Atlantic! I would not recommend them to anyone! Will definitely go business class or not at all in future.,0
"Auckland to Delhi via Guangzhou and I was really impressed.The planes were nearly new, comfortable and with plenty of room. The cabin staff were really attentive, and couldn't do enough to help. The meals were fine but perhaps not the greatest feature. The price was excellent, and all in all I would recommend flying with this airline.",1
"Kuala Lumpur to Miri. Overall a great improvement for Malaysia Airlines. Service was great. The seat is comfortable and the meal had improved a lot. However some dirt still can be seen on the chair. Anyway, they had improved a lot and hope to see another great improvement from them again in my next trip. Definitely will fly with them again.",1
"There was only 3 minutes left to board the plane due to the amount of people at security, we rush through JFK to the JetBlue area. They check in our bags, we ask if we are not too late. They say we are, but they hold the plane for us and we run to the Embraer 190 as fast as we could. This was really kind of the staff. The overall inflight experience was amazing, good staff, good legroom, and very nice staff taking care of the customers.",1
I flew with Ryanair from Gatwick to Belfast return with my friend on the 19th October 2017. Both times when we checked in we have been allocated separate seats even though the plane wasn't at its full capacity. Both me and my friend had a free seat next to us. When I did the check in online I couldn't select my own seat as I used to be able to do even though there was a free seat next to me. I had to pay extra just to sit next to my friend. They just don't know how to extract more and more money out of their customers. Also this year one of my flights has been cancelled because Ryanair did not have enough pilots. Their service is getting worse and worse!,0
"Singapore to Kuching. It was the best bow cost carrier I have flown with. Earlier, I have had many experiences with airlines like Wizzair, Ryanair or Norwegian, and Airasia is in my opinion the best LCC airline. Friendly staff. I would recommend this airline for short flights.",1
"Leaving LAX was 45 minutes late and then upon returning 3 days later, there was 4 delays, a cancellation, and then 4 more delays. Missed my 52nd wedding anniversary with my family. We did receive one cold piece of pizza and warm coke for our anniversary from them. Thanks Allegiant for a memorable anniversary. ",0
"Flew Athens to Chios. Much cheaper than Olympic Airways and you have access to SkyServ Lounge at Athens Airport, also free 13 kg Luggage and 3 kg handbag. There is not much food selection at the lounge but is good to be away from the crowds. Both flights on ATR42 and were on time. Crew were great and friendly. They offer coffee and a small cookie on a 50 minute flight. They do not have inflight magazines but they offer FreePress magazine.",1
"Johannesburg to Sydney. Very unpleasant flight which started with me being bumped off my pre booked bulkhead seat. Only 300ml of water provided for a 12 hour flight, poor service, dirty toilets and insufficient hot meals for breakfast, this for passengers in the front of economy which get served first. Very expensive economy flight and I could have flown to Europe from Australia on a decent Asian or Middle Eastern airline for half the cost of the Qantas flight.",0
"Ottawa to Fredericton. We have to sit here for nearly 2 hours to fly 1.5 hours. Plane was very warm and air didn't work.  I can understand maybe an hour delay, but 2 hours. Come on porter, be prepared.",0
"Atlanta to Manchester, Upper Class seat was a little narrower than expected but was comfortable in the sitting and reclined position. This was not the case when laid flat as it was hard and not very comfortable for sleep. Cabin crew attentive with a great choice of premium drinks available prior and after take off, evening meal of filet steak was good, the pre ordered breakfast was good apart from the poor scrambled eggs. It was a birthday treat to use Upper Class, an experience I enjoyed, but don't think its value for the price.",1
I'm flying Delta Air Lines today. I encourage everyone to use them. The plane is only half full for distancing. Impeccably clean. They gave us sanitizing wipes for our seats and boarded back to front to limit contact. Everyone is masked and extremely polite. Hats off to Delta for taking our safety seriously.,1
This airline is very unprofessional they just don't want to admit their mistakes and help. They have changed my time of departure 3 weeks before my flight and did not let me know i have figured it out just day before my departure. Thanks to them I have missed my international flight paid 1500 euros more. Until now no one has admitted their mistake no one has apologised. And no one wants to help. Clearly they are ignoring my messages and also clearly they dont see my point of if i get confirmed tickets you have to let me know for any change. If they would let me know i could change my international flight before and I wouldn't end it up paying extra money!,0
"Itinerary was London to Berlin via Dusseldorf, and Berlin back to London via Cologne. Out of 4 flights with Eurowings, 3 flights were delayed, the worst of which was 53 minutes. OK, not exactly the end of the world, however when I asked for a cup of water onboard the worst delayed flight I was told a cup of water was going to cost me 3 euros! Absolutely unacceptable, especially if you are delayed, and not provided with water.",0
"We had an excellent experience. All flights were on time. Staff was friendly and helpful. Absolutely zero issues. Our tickets cost about half what they would have with competitor airlines. We downloaded our own shows to watch. Seats were functional. Aircraft was very clean. Thank you, Spirit!",1
From Johannesburg to Addis Ababa and then to Frankfurt. Delayed 3 hours then more and more. Very little information as if they were afraid to tell us. Only one bottle of water during the 6 hours wait in the terrible airport of Addis. The inflight experience was a joke. Slow if any service and simply not a nice trip when finally in the air! Dreamliner it may be but quite like a nightmare!,0
"It was such a long time that we have not seen such a bad airline.  Flight almost 3 and 4 hours, you have 28 grams of salted biscuits and 25 grams of sweet biscuits Water comes without a glass. Directly from the plastic bottle And everything like that.",0
"Very old planes, poor food and minimal leg room in economy. Check in procedure online did not work for me or any of my fellow travellers. Special meal request given weeks in advance for food allergy was ignored. I spoke to a BA customer service representative as soon as I landed in Heathrow who said they could not help and referred to the telephone line who said the same but referred to the online complaints form. Have been trying for weeks to raise this as a concern for those with food allergies and prevent this from happening to others but no reply via their complaints website or on Twitter. Telephone hotline is now also currently unavailable.",0
"New York to Bangkok via Guangzhou. Everything was as good as can be. The flight attendants were extremely nice and helped make the 15 hour plane ride pleasant. The airline provided blankets, pillows, and headphones. The blanket was very much needed as the plane cabin got cold at times. Overall, there were no negatives and the flight crew was a big positive.",1
"Delhi to Adelaide to via Guangzhou. Worst experience to fly with China Southern. I was going back to Australia on 3rd July from Delhi. Without any advance information, at the Delhi check in counter staff told us our flight been cancelled due to a 3 hour delay meaning we would miss the connecting flight to Adelaide, and without any answer they send 5 passengers into a hotel. More then 24 hours later we are still in hotel and no idea what's going on.",0
"I am trying to change the flight date. Their Hotline has no German speaking staff, their English speaking Hotline took 59 minutes to connect me to a 1st tier person who could not help me and forwarded me to a ""cashier"" which put me in a new loop for another 50 minutes. There is no other way to change flights, their ""chat bot"" refers one to the same hotline. Making a hotline available that is actually useful is a primary service for any airline. This hotline is a joke.",0
"Canada changed travel restrictions 3 days before boarding. I was with my 5 year old. Made it all the way to the boarding gate when I was informed by a tap agent my 5 year old would not be allowed to board as she didn't have a PCR. It took 6 hours to clear customs grab my bags. I was told by the TAP agent who did not allow me on the flight that it is their job to check info before being given boarding passes and that I should speak to an agent before leaving the airport to re schedule a flight. I waited 2 hours at a complaints office, 2 hours later I still hadn't spoken to anyone. I left the airport with my 5 year old. I purchased 3000 dollar tickets home with TAP 2 days later. They hung up on me when I attempted to claim a voucher. The boarding was a joke they cram everyone into a small section with no seats available. Senior in wheel chairs lined up. Flight left 1 30 min late.",0
"I flew with Olympic air from Crete to Athens. They have an inconvenient website which is not very clear of what baggage is allowed. When you go for bag drop the crew, with attitude find all the reasons to charge you more. I will avoid to fly with them from now on.",0
"Glasgow to Heathrow. BA are a disgrace, it once stood for a high standard and flew the flag high. My flight from Islay was delayed by 2 hours, no fault of mine, so I missed my connecting flight! After being fobbed off as not my fault, nothing we can do I ended phoning and after an hour of being passed from pillar to post and back again, I had to pay for another flight. Money grabbing company with lousy customer service and lack of any feeling",0
"Lisbon to Amsterdam. Second time flying Vueling and second time delayed! This time by 4 hours, 5 if you consider the time difference. 9 months of bad reviews of this airline with delays and no change in service, what a disgrace! Get your act together, this is unprofessional.",0
Business class on one hour flight to Tehran. Check in and boarding organized. The flight was via Airbus A310 with clean interior. Full hot meal was served which I consider unusual for such a short flight. The cabin crew were friendly and around to assist passengers. I found the business class fare rather low  and I probably will use them again.,1
Istanbul to Manchester in Business class. The flight left on time but the service was appalling. After take off they served breakfast with little or no interaction with me. After clearing away the curtain was closed and the crew disappeared into the economy cabin. They ignored the premium passengers. They looked like they didn't want to be there.,0
Air India is disgusting. They removed us from the flight and gave our seats to other people without our consent. They then think they are doing us a favour by booking us in a hotel and on the next flight which is a whole 24 hours later. The hotel is a dump. It's disgusting just like Air India service as a whole. I had a doctors appointment and operation booked and because of them I am stuck in Delhi. I could have made it on the Indigo flight but they refused to book for me. The staff was so rude to us saying take it or leave it. This airline needs to be held responsible for how unprofessional they are.,0
"This was the worst travel experience that I have ever had, they would just cancel flights and not give you any reasonable change, we had to wait 3 days to get to our destination, of course claiming our bags was also a headache since we needed to wait about 4 hours to get them back, I would not recommend this airline at all, if you can book another one please do so.",0
"Mauritius to London Heathrow with Air Mauritius. Efficient check in once computer problems solved. Flight ok, seat uncomfortable as with all economy class. No regular water supply despite dehydration risk. Very good overall, will definitely use again with knowledge gained. Much much better than BA. Like the service, like the staff, need to expand film choices out and back. Music could be better.",1
"Booked a ticket through United Airlines Austrian Airlines operated the flight from Vienna Austria to Washington DC. Had a 30 hour delay due to weather in Washington DC had to be rebooked for the next day. Arrived at the airport with the new ticket United had sent me but Austrian Airlines still had the old version in their system. They refused to call United and ask for verification even though I showed them the email I got from United. I was told that if I ""book through United and pay them and not Austrian Airlines"" that I ""can't expect any help or assistance from Austrian Airlines"". In the end the result was that I missed my connection in Washington DC which resulted in an even greater delay. I will avoid any flights operated by Austrian Airlines from now on since they don't help in case something doesn't go as planned.",0
The worst airline flying from Manila to Iloilo. The flight was delayed and going back from Iloilo to Manila was delayed 6 hours for no reason they do not inform you as of why they are delayed. They had other flights that came and went but were priority flights but not ours lots of upset people.,0
I flew from Phuket to Perth and need not have worried. Flights were on time the aircraft excellent great cabin staff and the food I ordered was quite acceptable for the price. The seating was fine and no different to a full fare airline. Would rate it as one of the most comfortable flights I have taken.,1
"I would like to share my experience with WestJet. In June 2015 I had a flight from Calgary to Kyiv with 2 stops in between. Due some regulations and circumstances I wasn't able to take that flight. I was concerned a lot about the situation that occurred and I have contacted the costumer service support. I was satisfied with solution, but mainly I want to thank for pleasant experience with WestJet customer service.  All replies via email were fast. They were straight to the point and all replies were pleasant and polite and I got some personal understanding. The solution was found really fast.",1
"Helsinki to Singapore. I am disappointed with the flight attendants on AY131 from Helsinki to Singapore on 8 June 2019. In particular, one of the air stewardess was speaking so loudly in Mandarin at the back of the plane during takeoff and landing. It was really late at night and the passengers would appreciate if the cabin crew could keep quiet and let us rest! FinnAir needs to relook into the crew's training!",0
Ho Chi Minh City to Hanoi. Really satisfied with this flight. Flight was on time. Meal was very tasty. Cabin crew were professional and friendly.,1
"I wanted to share my current experience with you as I board my flight to Cancun MX this morning. I boarded priority and after getting settled there was no traffic and due to how cold the runway was I urgently needed to use the restroom when I walked to the rear of the plane I asked the flight attendant where the restroom was and was responded to with ""they weren't working out there?"" As if I was an issue and should have used the restroom prior to boarding. As a pregnant woman I was highly offended and she should have been more considerate of people's conditions. I am disgusted with the way I was treated!",0
"Washington to Helsinki via Keflavik. The flight crews were really nice and patient. The 6 hour flights had better planes than the 3 hour one from Keflavik to Helsinki and back. We got an old plane coming back from Helsinki, but a new one from Keflavik to DC. The food you had to pay for. Kind of mediocre, but that is airline food. Got a ham and cheese baguette at Keflavik  airport. I assume it is the same as that served on plane. Fills you up, but that is it. No lost baggage and almost on time.",1
"My original flight was cancelled just over 2 weeks before my actual flight and although alternative flights were available, British airways affected the trip I planned. It feels like BA is doing a favour to passengers rather than being paid to deliver the service.",0
"Eureka to Boise via San Francisco. I purchased tickets from California to Idaho 6 weeks ago and on the 30th I set out for my trip and it was delayed several times then it was eventually rebooked for a later time. Mine happened to be the next day with multiple stops and layovers. Left at 7am arrived in LA at 9am layover till 1045 set out to San Francisco but now caught on the strip unable to leave and missing my flight from SFO to BOI. Now I'm stranded again. I took 2 days off work for this trip and it has caused me so much extra money. Was even charged for long term parking yesterday when my flight was changed. Every time I travel with United I have the worst experience. I no longer want to continue with my trip, I just want to go home",0
"Don't fly business class with Saudia, it's not worth the money. They didn't have anything available from the menu, flight attendant disappears for 30 minutes, I kept asking for water, they weren't happy about it and they kept bringing me little cups of water. They didn't have any bags left that they gave to everyone, never fly with them again and don't recommend them.",0
"Abbotsford to Puerto Vallarta. Have now been on hold for 2 hours with Swoop. Trying to cancel as per their email regarding Corona. Cant cancel online, cant get anyone online, cant get anyone via email, and have now wasted 2 hours on phone which Im sure will disconnect any minute. This is not the first time Swoop. You offer terrible customer service and Westjet your parent company should be ashamed of themselves.",0
Cape Town to Singapore. Don't bother to hang your jacket. Don't bother to help open up your bedding but one has to struggle with it oneself. Rude interaction. Don't bother to help with opening the table for meals. Often forget to offer some passengers cheese and fruit when it is standard for all business class. Poor lounge food choice with only Indian food available to eat. Don't allow couples to travel together.,0
Delhi to Guwahati. They destroyed a super wonderful journey of mine. They charged a huge amount of money for a little extra luggage and in spite of repeatedly informing them about fragile luggage they destroyed my belongings. No other flights had any problem with the on the cabin luggage including international airlines. Spicejet had a very rude behaviour. Never ever board this flight. Worst experience ever.,0
"New York to Dubai via Stockholm. I reached the airport at 8 pm for 1030 pm flight. There was a long queue and when they announced Stockholm passengers should come forward, I rushed to the counter. At the counter the attendant said there is some visa issue and I should go to supervisor. The supervisor said she needed to speak with the customs. When everything was cleared she says there is no problem and she can give the boarding pass. But the check in has closed. When I called customer care they said I should have called 30 mins before departure. I called as soon as I the supervisor told me to call customer care. I had also paid 140 GBP online for my two checked in bags. And checked in online. I had done everything there was needed to be done and I still was denied boarding pass and no refund.",0
"In the absence of true competition in Iran's flight industry, Iran Air is misusing its monopoly by not being accountable towards passengers most of whom don't have any other option for direct flight to Iran. Iran Air has learnt to how not to be responsive. Awful food, entertainment, and hygiene service. Not recommended to those who don't like to have a flight as if being in a dilapidated instead of a decent airbus.",0
It is a nice flying experience with China Southern Airlines and I really enjoyed it.  Crew members provide excellent services on the aircraft. Staff on the ground also provide great service.,1
Flight to Abbotsford delayed 3 hours. Messed up my whole schedule. Then the flight back home delayed 5 hours. All in all horrible. Checking in every other airline has 4 to 6 people checking in. With a line up out the door Flair only has 2 and 1 person boarding the flights. No wonder they are always hours behind. Pay the extra and fly elsewhere and arrive on time. Planes are garbage as well not tv no WiFi and if they want they will give up your seat you paid extra for. Been on hold 4 hours trying to call them and complain.,0
"Lisbon to Madrid. They used to have friendly cabin crew members, that seems to have changed. Still, congrats for departing more or less on time. Aircraft was also clean and the short flight was a breeze.",0
Sydney to Athens via Singapore. It was a great series of flights with a stopover in Singapore of about 8 hours. I spent the time in the business lounge at Changi Airport.,1
"Washington DCA to Chicago. I just want to express my gratitude to 2 American Airlines customer service employees at Reagan National airport in DC. I am dealing with a vision disability and the both went the extra mile to help me change my flight and get me the proper info and they did it with a great attitude. Thank you, your patience and kindness went above and beyond!",1
Sincere thanks to wonderful staff at the Sunshine Coast airport and T4 Terminal at Tullamarine Airport on 13th February. I badly sprained my ankle and would not have been able to return home without their assistance. They did everything to make my return home as comfortable as possible. Their assistance was given willingly and cheerfully. Thanks again to these wonderful staff.,1
"Horrible flight BA from Gatwick to Cape Town and Iberia on the return. I am only 5'2"" 8st 10 and I find the leg room too cramp. The onboard flight entertainment system was down on the BA flight most of the time. It was probably in the last 2 hours of the flight before they managed to fix it and the system was old fashioned and movies were streamed on a loop. The food was barely edible. Coming back on Iberia the entertainment system was better and the food was also better but the seats legroom was just as bad. I was almost bumped off my connecting flight at MAD due to the lockers being filled up. I had another connection to make at LHR and I was not going to miss that so I had to insist they let me on though loads of other passengers were led off. This was the worst flight I have flown on. Last long haul BA flight for me.",0
"Copenhagen to Aarhus. Another delayed flight with SAS. This appears the norm, rather than the exception and in my experience delays are always announced very close to departure time leaving one with no chance to adjust or change plans. Avoid if you can.",0
"The worst airline I traveled. shares flights with American Airlines, business class codes do not match between airlines. Poor service, 2 hours standing expecting 20 people in San Pablo waiting for a Gol employee, trip 25 days ago I still claim my frequent flyer miles. They do not credit them, they say they do not know if I flew, incredible, very bad, do not use",0
Salt Lake City to Charleston. I would give less than one star if I could. When paying to fly you expect to sit by your spouse not several rows behind. Maybe they should think about updating the seating arrangements,0
"Singapore to Bangkok. Singapore Airlines provides a reliable and consistent service.  The flight attendants welcome passengers on board with smiles and are present to assist passengers to their seats and provide help with hand luggage, etc. There are 2 meal options and having flown this route over 5 times in the past 12 months, I have always managed to get the option of my choice. The entertainment options are wide and varied and the attendants present throughout the entire flight. The airline recently upgraded the earphones given out to passengers which passengers can bring home. Each earphone pack comes with 2 pairs of spare ear pieces of different sizes. This airline is definitely ahead of the curve and the challenge is to see how it maintains its lead during times where the industry is full of tough competitors without compromising on standards that its loyal customers have come to expect.",1
My parents and I are on vacation to attend my brother's graduation in Canada. We are now required to look for alternatives on our own because JAL cancelled our flight to Malaysia a couple of days prior to our flight due to it being an overnight transit. They are not assisting with alternatives and the only compensation they offer is a refund which is not immediate or a flight 4 months from now. I was told it was my fault for purchasing a ticket with overnight stay.  And why is cancellation notice only given through calls and at the very last minute?,0
"At Manchester check in was very quick and staff were very friendly. Lounge was awful, small limited choice of food and the spirits on offer were of an obscure brand. Boarding aircraft was efficient and flight to Hong Kong departed on time. Cabin crew very attentive and good choice of food on offer. Seat was comfortable but I did not fully recline seat as I found this to be an odd sensation, lifting the backrest slightly was much better and I managed to sleep well. At HK after waiting for baggage for over 20 minutes we were advised that ground staff were unable to access the baggage hold. Eventually got the bags 35 minutes after arriving at carousel. There was good choice of IFE and considering this was my first flight with Cathay Pacific I was quite impressed. They certainly compare well against my usual carrier.",1
"Sal to Gatwick. The worst flight I've had. I already lowered my expectations but nothing could have prepared me for how bad this was, it ruined the end of a great holiday. Check in lady told me to take the souvenir on board rather than check it in as it would be safer, unfortunately when I got on board it didn't fit in the lockers above my seat. Went to the Cabin Manager to ask for some help and the response was ""it's not my fault you brought something too big, if you can't find somewhere then you can't take it"". Thankfully fellow passengers were helpful in moving bags etc around to help me fit it in. No  vegetarian meal despite ordering one and having the proof. Once again the Cabin Manager said no food was loaded, even for purchase, other than the chicken meal, so no food for me. Decided to just get some sleep, as it was a night flight, unfortunately the crew decided to make announcements all night, chat so loud in the galley I could hear all the intimate details of their conversations. The ""extra leg room"" seat was the most uncomfortable ever. Virtually nothing to watch on the IFE, compared to the amount available of every other airline I've flown on for a flight of that length. When I complained to Thomson on return, after waiting a month for them to email back it said ""we can't please everyone and most customers are happy with our service!""",0
Perth to Denpasar.  Malindo sold our group of five university students non refundable flights which were found out to be cancelled before purchase. Flights still showed to be departing on the morning of the flight on Malindo Air website  even though they were cancelled three days prior. Malindo refusing to give any form of compensation and now blocking all emails in regards to matter. I am disgusted with their service and this has been a horrible experience. I would give them 0 if possible.,0
Flight service is not for the family passengers. They cancelled my flight on 4th September and have not issued refund on time. We have to send a lot of mails for the refund and will not get proper reply. Better to avoid this flight.,0
"25 hours before the departure, Turkish Airlines informed me that my ticket to Stockholm via Istanbul is cancelled. I currently pay the expensive business class ticket for the flight. I was too late to attend the wedding at the city of Stockholm. I was no choice what to do after that, Later I left my home to Narita Airport which is 3 hours away in Fukushima Prefecture. When I arrive, I told them that I must give up and cancelled the ticket and instead of waiting for the next 24 hours, I better book Lufthansa instead which depart from Haneda at afternoon. I will avoid this airline after this. I even cannot give zero for the seat comfort and ground service.",0
Birmingham to Quito via Amsterdam with KLM in Business Class. Excellent flight throughout both outbound and on return. Delightful staff on board. Food in business was very acceptable and served at just the right times. Very comfortable seats with best pillows of any business class we have flown. Ground staff also excellent in each airport. Crown Lounge in Schiphol gets very crowded.,1
"They canceled my flight on 10th December, refund takes 5 months. Now I have to wait for 5 months to get my money. People in the chat or rude and no respect.",0
"Terrible experience, flight got delayed, no explanation, we boarded and were told we needed to get out of the plane again. We were supposed to arrive at 8 15 but we did not get go Fll until 1 am. Never mind on the Way to Fll to Asheville we had similar issues. Avoid this airline at all cost.",0
"Travelling with KLM again was a disappointing experience from the ground to the gate. Our luggage was missing from their codeshare airline from Sevilla to Amsterdam. We are currently back home with no news on our luggage. Secondly on our departure, we wanted to clarify on our seats but was shut off on our request at the gate. Upon reaching the gate, the staff simply waved off with a full flight without listening to us and constantly cutting us in our sentence. We were even told that there is no need to listen to our long story. The boarding was also messy with no clear instructions on luggage to be put on hold. On board, I was questioned why did I not prepare food for my baby when I had ordered for infant food during booking of the flight. It was an awful start to end and start our year with KLM.",0
"Dublin to Milan. Pretty decent, definitely better than Ryanair. It was on time, food was delicious but a bit expensive, it was 5 euro to get a can of soft drink. The seating was comfortable and I had lots of legroom. Overall really good airline.",1
Philadelphia to Las Vegas. Flight was rescheduled 4 times in the same day and I reached the airport just to find out that the flight was cancelled. All other airlines were operating that day. Spirit Airlines is the worst airline ever and I will never book with them again. Their customer service is poor too!,0
My wife and I recently took flight TS296 and TS297 from Calgary to Glasgow and return we would like to say the flights were excellent from check in to landing on both flights. The new cabin lighting and design made the flights more relaxing. We will definitely fly with them again.,1
"Kuala Lumpur to Vancouver via Hong Kong. Shockingly poor customer service. So many things went wrong and the staff handled everything so poorly.  flew Kuala Lumpur to Hong Kong. Apparently there was a bad storm in HK so we couldn't land. Circled around, landed in Macau, refueled, landed back in HK to be told our connecting flight to Canada had taken off. If our flight couldn't land, how come the other flight could leave? Staff took a horribly long time on the computer offering us new airlines. We were bounced around three different airlines to be told in the end that we couldn't board any of them for a myriad of reasons. Offered us overnight accommodation but couldn't find our baggage. Came to the airport to ask for a letter for delayed baggage claim and was bounced from one department to another, all saying that they couldn't do anything. Things go pear shaped all the time. But the staff that handled it were close to incompetent. Asked for flight alternatives and got yelled at as he couldn't understand simple English. I've flown budget airlines with better trained staff.",0
"Beijing to San Jose. The flight assistants were very kind and helpful and the seat comfortable even  in economy class. The food and beverage were good, and we had various types of drinks. Comparing the price and service quality, I would recommend Hainan Airlines to other travelers.",1
"Haven't flown yet. Flight got cancelled. Their solution, after spending three hours on the phone waiting for customer service  was to offer a flight six days later. Finally got rebooked for three days later and now having to wait more time to get the hotel voucher. This is terrible customer service.",0
"This was our first experience with Austrian Airlines and it was memorable for all of the wrong reasons. Delays, missed connecting flights, lost luggage, rude service agents. Finally made it to our destination over 24 hours later than scheduled. Luggage is still lost and the website tracking system is absolutely no help. Quite simply, we will never fly with Austrian Airlines again even if it means paying more money to a different airline or taking a longer route to get there. This was my worst experience with an airline in more than 30 years of international travel.",0
I have had terrible experience exchanging and then seeking refund for Lufthansa's business flexible tickets. Business flexible is a joke. It's neither flexible nor fully refundable. They have a really convoluted system.,0
"This is by far the worst company I have travelled with. They changed my flight 5 times and constantly giving me false information. They are part of the Star Alliance group, but doesnt want to give you ticket from other of their alliance members. Refunding your money will take a year and this basically means you are being a bank for them. They are constantly not picking their phones and putting you on hold. From April, now I'm not even sure will i fly in July! This is ridiculous.",0
Delhi to Sydney. Worst flight I've ever experienced. The seats were so uncomfortable. The food was mediocre and the entertainment system stopped working 6 hours into the 13 hour flight. No flight attendant was able to fix it. Such a disgraceful service. Never again would I fly Air India.,0
"Dubai to Cochin. Worst airline in the world. They charge all the cabin luggage. My cabin bag was 7kg when checking at home. SpiceJet says it is 7.4 kg, ask me to pay extra charge for 1 kg. Also they charge me extra for Duty free items purchased from airport. Safety belt hook was not working in my seat. Toilet are dirty and flush not working properly. Passage is too narrow, congested. Flight delay 40 minutes for take off without any reason. Delay of luggage on arrival. It feels like hell.",0
Absolutely terrible. I knew it was budget but the customer service and queue times are horrendous. Flying IAH to ORD there's consistently a 30 minute wait to begin deboarding the flight. The planes are outdated and I honestly feel in need of a shower and Laundromat after a 2 hour flight in their terrible seats.,0
"Lagos to Los Angeles via Addis Ababa and Dublin with Ethiopian Airlines. I am a frequent flyer with Platinum Medaliion status with the Skyteam. So I am in a position to judge which service is good. I have never flown Ethiopian before 2017. My recent 25 hours plus flight was exceptional. They exceeded my expectations in every aspect. Equipment is modern and the B787 from ADD to DUB to LAX was fantastic. Food was great courteous staff on the plane. Touch screen entertainment was superior to many other airlines I have flown. Only complaint I can say is the ground staff at the airport, maybe need a little more training on that end.",1
"Alexandria to Dubai via Bahrain. It is so frustrating when you go to the airport, and then discover that the flight from Alexandria was cancelled? Without neither your agent or airline to notify you in advance!I sincerely never recommend Gulf Air.",0
"We had four very good flights with Thai Airways, travelling London to Krabi via Bangkok return. It was great to be on flights with enough staff, Emirates and BA should note. The food was of a good quality, and the drinks didn't stop. Only downside was the check in at Heathrow, quite poor.",1
"Just returned from Crete. I am male 5' 10"" average build. The seat was extremely uncomfortable. My knees were hard up against the seat in front. It was a night flight but absolutely impossible to even relax let alone snooze. I will never fly them again.",0
Today I flew after 7 months with SpiceJet and as usual your cabin crew ere excellent. They are the reason I choose SpiceJet. Thanks for making my flight so comfortable and continue to smile though eyes.,1
"My family and I arrived 2 hours before departure to the airport, but for those 2 hours we stood in line, when we got to the desired gate, we were not allowed on board because registration was closed. Hoping to find a solution to the problem, the airline employees lied that there was an opportunity to fly on Sunday. Over the next 7 hours, I went from gate to gate, but unfortunately, in the end, when I no longer had the strength and I started looking for help from the airline's management, he began to talk to me quite rudely!",0
"Auckland to Christchurch with Jetstar Airways, the first flight in the morning at 6.10 am ready for boarding and flight cancelled. First time in my life I have just been given us a fotocopy paper saying I am sorry, asked for compensation. They did not even put us on the next flight, only on the third one, and we were stranded 6 hours in the airport not even a meal voucher, when others had. Very bad, bad service.",0
"Never before flown with an airline that completely ignored its customers. Despite severe delays that caused us to miss our flight to Los Angeles, the staff on the flight showed no desire to try to help us. They were rude and arrogant when we talked to them. The staff at the information desk did give us a hotel room, but not once did they apologize for the delay and the day we now miss at the destination. Will never recommend anyone to fly with Air New Zealand.",0
"Flew American Airlines from Ontario to Phoenix. I had to call the customer service for a question about baggage and upgrade. I would like to say how impressed I was with their customer service. Upon completing a short voice prompt, I was directed to the appropriate department. I expected a wait time as with most lines. I was pleasantly surprised to be connected to a customer service representative in under a minute. When I talked to her, she was most gracious and helpful.",1
Customer service was horrible. Gate agents did not seem to know the company policies. I was told that I had to pay for a carry on bag or I couldn't board my flight. Was instructed by 2 gate agents to take what I could carry on board and to place my bag next to trash can. which was tossed in trash can after I boarded plane. I had a 10 hour lay over in Denver and no change of clothing. I really thought they would put my bag in lost and found but it was actually tossed out. I spoke to Frontier about this and was offered a 200.00 voucher to fly in the future. This is still hard to believe I will never fly this airline again! By TSA guide lines I was not suppose to leave an unattended bag but was told by the Frontier gate agents that it was ok.,0
"Pegasus Airlines airport staff is just pure inept. I am sitting at Istanbul SAW airport right now waiting for my flight to Dalaman. They have been delaying the flight in small increments without any announcements. Currently the delay is 2.5 hours. In fact, a Pegasus Airlines flight which was supposed to leave after my flight to the same destination,  is already boarding. When you try to ask them if they can provide any information they just say ""no English"" and get an easy escape. I flew with them on another flight from Izmir to Istanbul a couple of days ago too. While on that occasion, the flight was on time, the cabin crew was quite rude at the time of seating. In short, this airline has left a bad taste for me, but I guess that's what you pay for when going for the cheap ticket. I still hope I will make it to Dalaman today!!",0
"Very poor customer service when it comes to issuing refunds, as cannot provide a timeframe for when the refund will be processed. This has forced me to initiate either the section 75 or chargeback scheme via my bank. Would not recommend!",0
"Louisville to Vegas. The service was horrible they were rude, they lost my luggage and I did not get it back until my trip was over. They only refund me 50 dollars of the money I spent on clothing and other things that was in my luggage and I had receipt for everything I purchased.",0
After 6 hours at the airport they canceled the flight and sent us to a hotel an hour away. Horribly rude staff and then gave us tacos for dinner which I had to pay half the bill because they said the drinks and only a certain dollar amount was allowed after we already eat. They say that we need to be at the airport at 7 am but they don't know if our plane will be able to fly so no departure time just wait till they can figure it out. I know it's the holiday but come on we have been patient we just want a little respect and for Delta to do the right thing. I ask everyone to stay away from Delta as they don't care what happens to you after they get your money.,0
Flight from Newcastle to Brisbane via Dubai and Singapore. We booked in August with Emirates staff promising seats that would be allocated for me being disabled I have severe walking problems that require me to be able to stand up and stretch my legs. What I got were seats in row 37 seats D and E just getting to the seats was extremely hard as I need to use a crutch to walk with the aisles are too narrow to move to the seats while using a crutch. I will never fly with them again.,0
New Orleans to Baltimore. Spirit has the worst customer service ever experienced. If you check in within an hour of the flight you are not guaranteed a seat. They also offer terrible consolations for their mistakes. I will never fly through them again.,0
Economy seats on flights TG911 and TG910 a family of four. Great service on the Boeing 747 with good selection of films TV program's games and flight info via the seat back screens. Staff don't stop with free drinks meals and snacks. Flights in both directions provided a choice of two hot dinners and two breakfast options. Both routes left and arrived on time. Your Thai holiday starts just as soon as you board the plane. Quality of food was fine. Not fine dining as some would appear to require but certainly as good and tasty as any other airline that I have experienced.,1
"I have no idea how Air Canada rates as one of the best airlines in North America. We flew business class and my head phones didn't work. They offered me some sort of points. But the real problem was my luggage tagged, ""priority"", came off last. I waited 45 minutes while all the luggage was unloaded and my ride home drove endlessly around the airport. Last luggage down on the carousel. I tried to contact them today on their ""chat line"" and no one seems to be working there as I waited 30 minutes without anyone answering. Air Canada, living up to what ought to be their motto, ""We're not happy unless you're not happy""",0
We booked a trip to Vegas for our son's 21st birthday when we called to check our flight it was delayed before we even left home. Arrived at the airport and was told the flight was delayed again from 9.30 to 11.30 however then the flight was delayed again to 12.15 and then to 1.30pm and then we got the great news that our flight was cancelled along with two other flights. Never has this happened in all my years of traveling they had no other flight to book us on until after our trip dates were over! We will not book with this airline again as it ruined our vacation and they were not helpful at all or concerned.,0
"I don't have the time or space to say everything I want to say, but I will say they are horrible and will never fly with them again. Our flight from Atlanta to Kansas was delayed. They gave us no updates as to where our plane was or when it was to be expected. They just laughed and joked around with their buddies about how ""Frontier is never delayed"". Obviously Frontier's staff do not have much respect for their company. Doesn't reflect well.",0
"Xuzhou to Auckland via Guangzhou on 28th Dec 2017. The customer service has been consistent throughout. The crew were fantastic even though the flight from Xuzhou was only less than 3 hours, appreciate very much, will fly again in near future with Southern Airline.",1
I was meant to be flying with Wizz Air back from Athens until we were told it was operated by Titan Airways. However it was a pleasant surprise to climb aboard a Titan aircraft. The staff were extremely professional and incredibly helpful. I would happily fly again with them.,1
Cathay Pacific from Hong Kong to Cairns was probably the worst flight I have experienced. Leaving Hong Kong it seemed as the crew had little control over the large amount of Chinese family groups that were on the aircraft and their requests for passengers to take their seats were at first ignored.First time ever that I witnessed crew yelling at passengers to do as they were told. The food was terrible and the seat comfort was poor when the person in front reclined their seat. I will not recommend or use again.,0
"Bahia Drake to San Jose. I booked two flights with Nature Air back in January 18, 2018. After the Nature Air crash, they canceled all flights through when I was to fly. They told me they would refund my fare, but no refund has occurred. I have contacted them over 20 times. Now when I contact them, they tell me to ""wait until next friday.""",0
"Appalling airline. Worst travel experience in over 50 years of international travel. Unfortunately, it is the only airline servicing stunning Azores. Five hour flight delay on the outbound from Boston to Ponta Delgada and two hour delay on the return. Plane sat on tarmac for an hour in Boston waiting for an open gate. Planes must be ones taken out of service by major carriers. Seats are from the 80's. No inflight entertainment, which isn't a deal breaker. Just bizarre that the seat backs have screens. One flight was chartered from a Portuguese airline, HiFly. Never a good sign. One positive was that the flight attendants were accommodating and professional. Food was atrocious. So very frustrating that the spectacularly beautiful Azores is served by this nightmare airline.",0
"Zurich to Los Angeles. I have been very impressed by my latest flight with Swiss. The cabin crew was extremely friendly and warm. The Boeing 777 seat's is very comfortable, with a generous recline and slide that allowed me to sleep. But what impressed me most is the abundance of food! Lunch was ok quality but good quantity. And during the flight the cabin crew passed by with ice cream, a sandwich and finally with a warm light meal. Impressive! And Zurich airport is a breeze to connect through. Will try to fly with them in my next trip to Europe!",1
"This is the first time I am travelling with gGo First and a day before they have rescheduled flight late by 2 hours and on the same before 1 hour of boarding they have again rescheduled it late by 1 hour. I have wasted three hours of mine with this airline. I will never travel again with this airline, neither I would suggest anyone. It will be late night 1 for reaching Hyderabad and transportation will also be charged high. Waste service.",0
"I travel with Qantas extensively. The crew are pretty awesome and we get good service. This flight was no exception. Champagne offered, good selection of wines and spirits, tasty food served with a friendly smile and good humour. I also had a huge choice of what to watch.  I will continue flying with them.",1
"Santa Rosa to Las Vegas. Spend a few more dollars and do not fly this airline. We have had 2 experiences with this airline and both have been horrible in more than just one way. Our flight got cancelled just like that a week before the flight, still working on getting our money back. First experience included almost 2 hours of departure delay without given an apology or explanation, on the way back we waited one hour inside the plane before the plane took off. Customer service not so compassionate or understanding of any issue or even get our own money back.",0
Before I even got on the plane its a disaster. Original flight cancelled and moved to a flight two hours later. This was not suitable so had to call to get an earlier flight. Managed to get one an hour earlier. They didn't transfer my seats across so now I'm going to have to separate my two small children so good luck other passengers. Waited on hold for 25 mins to speak to someone because couldn't check in online. I started speaking and they put me on hold then came back pretending they couldn't hear my and just cut me off. Told me to wait 15 mins and the online check in would work. it didn't. I don't mind waiting because of lack of staff but to be ignored and cut off is something else entirely.,0
"This is my returning flight and now the two times I've flown with Frontier Airlines I can count the number of smiles or ""thank you"" or ""have a nice day"" on 2 fingers. The customer service is the worst and Frontier should be embarrassed. I stood in like for 45 minutes waiting to check a bag, and literally not a single customer was given a smile. The employees make it known that their work life is so miserable which then makes the customers experience horrible. Also, its 2018 and these airlines dont have wifi? Get with it Frontier, you are an embarrassment of an airline. I am a frequent flyer and bought these because it was the only airline available for the specific times I needed to fly.",0
"San Diego to Houston via Chicago. Rich was our flight attendant and was very friendly, funny and very accommodating. The pilot was friendly as well and got us caught up and back on schedule. That we work they got us to our connecting flight that we were afraid we would miss,  they were all awesome!",1
"Toronto to Calgary. First flight was delayed for 3 hours. Return flight back to Calgary delayed for 5 hours. No email what so ever that it's going to be delayed, they usually do email. The website flight status says it's on time. Before we left at 4am it says flight is on time. Then we arrived at 5am at the check in and they said its delay. We checked the website at 6am and it still says it's on time. This airline is a joke and a waste of money and time. The gate number on your ticket is not the same. Doesn't make sense how a Westjet flight at 7am is not delay and this flight at 7am is delayed.",0
"We had to fly with Frontier Airlines on February 16 from Orlando to Detroit. The flight was cancelled 10 minutes before boarding, the explanation was bad weather. The reality was that there weren't enough passengers. There was no help from Frontier Airlines they were very rude. They said we can fly on February 17 for free, because this is the next flight for them. The Frontier Airlines customer service does not exist at all, they just recommend online chat that is a robot, the worst experience ever. As a result, we were forced to book a flight with another company without assistance. The tickets were a lot more expensive and it went out of my pocket because we could not postpone the trip. The worst experience in my life.",0
"Avoid this airline. Awful experience every time I fly with them. Flights get cancelled for no reason. Flights constantly get delayed, and delayed, and delayed again. Customer service is shocking, updates on new arrival and departure times are slow. Seats are very cramped, hand luggage is checked for the 7kg limit and they will stop you boarding if you are over and don't pay extra. It's just and all round horrible experience flying with this company.",0
"On two separate instances Jet airways cancelled my flight within 24 hours from departure. After cancelling the first time they just sent me an email 6 hours before the flight and it was a hell to get a hold of them to rebook another flight. Second time was even worse they just rebooked me to another day without consulting if it worked for me or not. I ended up on customer service and hold lines for 8 hours since I would have missed my next international flight because of them. Worst part is they did have alternative flights available in economy class but after cancelling many customers they had hiked the prices of alternative flights and kept refusing to book those due to price difference. I ended up booking with another airline at twice the price since her airways only agreed to refund me at a price I had paid 1 month in advance, to book the same day hiked price instead. Horrible customer service and operations.",0
"Indianapolis to Washington Reagan. Everything went wrong during our team travel to the 2019 NCAA Rowing championships. Half of the group did not have tickets upon checking in, and we were held at check in until 20 minutes before boarding. The group of 30 had to run through TSA, and barely made it to the gate in time. However 3 individuals, the head coach, athletic director and an athlete were not allowed to board the plane, and were left standing at the gate while we sat for 10 minutes. We were told nothing could be done, and that it was the American Airlines way. The next flight to LGA was overbooked by over 10 seats. Overall the customer service has been horrible, with no consideration of keeping a group of 30 student athletes together or even having tickets to board the next flight.",0
Flight was comfortable though a 3 hour delay from Kuching to Kuala Lumpur. The snack and drinks were a welcome gesture only hope the water portion could be bigger. The seats was comfy though the flight attendants need to be trained further in assisting people whom require help with overhead baggage.,1
Flew Premium from London Gatwick to Sanford Florida with my wife and 2 daughters and had a wonderful flight outbound and inbound the meals were excellent. Monarch flight crew very professional and friendly and we found the seats comfortable. The only down side was the inflight entertainment poor quality TV screens and no available information on what is showing on the flight not that it is worth it. Not good if you are on a long haul flight.,1
From Amsterdam to Minsk and back. Fly this flight every second week now for a year experienced only once a small delay of half an hour. The planes are good in wintertime they use a smaller new plane. Staff are friendly and helpful. Food is not too good. They fly only 5 times per week and in the middle of the day.,1
"Guangzhou to Jinan with China Southern. The flight was overbooked, but as I'm a frequent flier I got an upgrade from economy to business class. The entertainment system was very nice and I liked the food provided. It was near the Chinese lunar new year, so there were more flights than usual. It took three times longer than usual to get through the security check. I think the airport and the airline should have some better procedures to handle this kind of situation.",1
Adelaide to Cairns with a stop over in Brisbane. The flights were each 2 hours the seats were comfortable and the flight crew were very friendly.,1
Flew from Minneapolis MN to Las Vegas. Flight was a 2 hour delay. They didn't notify us through the text program they have you sign up for so we were at the airport for 4 hours. First we were told it was a rain delay in Las Vegas then it was maintenance. When we boarded the pilot said it was due to rain in Houston Texas. Seems a little suspicious to me. We knew about all the cheap fares and bare fares about the airline. I had also flown this airline before and had not had a problem. Our flight was full on the way to Las Vegas. We felt packed in so tight to those seats. It was possibly the most uncomfortable flight I've ever flown and it was only 3 hours. On our return home we found a way to print our tickets before getting to the airport. But in the process I tried to check us in via online and the website all of a sudden crashed. It took 2 hours to get the site back up. Finally we got them printed and just felt relieved to do that. All day we checked our flight time due to the fact that our first flight was delayed. It was actually set to arrive 15 mins earlier than planned which was great and we had planned accordingly. We set up our transportation to the airport and as we were on our way the flight changed to a delay of 2 Hours again. We all felt defeated. We completely understand that there are some things that can't be fixed. But with the way it happened both times it seemed as though it was poor planning on Spirit's end. Why schedule a flight for 12am when you're really going to leave at 2am? Again 4 hours in an airport is no way to spend a vacation. The attendants at the airport for spirit were rude. On both ends. We will never fly Spirit Airlines again.,0
Malaga to Newcastle 24th Oct 2013. After reading some of the reviews on this forum I begin to wonder if we were all on Jet 2 flights. I agree that they were on time cabin staff on both outward and inward flights very pleasant but the aircraft's were decidedly lacking in both space and comfort Why don't these airlines make it a bit more comfortable for passengers surely people would pay extra for a decent seat. We paid for extra legroom seat on the way out but could not book any on the flight home. Even with the extra legroom the hard plastic seat are a nightmare. I see that Jet 2 are now offering some long haul flights to New York and Boston it would be absolutely unbearable to travel that distance in on of their aircraft. No matter how cheap it was I would not consider a flight with them. Also this particular flight very stressful on the way back when just as we were about to land the pilot aborted the landing. This of course caused myself and others an anxious wait until the pilot eventually said that a bulb was not lit up on the control panel. Thankfully we eventually landed safely but apart from the uncomfortable journey the rundown state of their aircraft would cause me not to use Jet 2 again.,0
"Gatwick to Funchal. The cabin crew were amazing, made the flight a really happy experience can't praise them enough. The captain was also very informative to the passengers and overall one of the best flights I have flown on.",1
"Very Good airline, professional cabin crew.  Very good service and punctual. Excellent covid measurements .",1
Oslo to Luton. They made me pay for hand language. Very noisy plane. This is the First and last time I will travel using Wizz air.,0
"Johannesburg to Durban. Shocking attitude from all the staff. Pretentious and entitled. So disappointed. I was standing at the gate with a coffee waiting to board but nobody called last boarding calls. So walked to the desk and the staff were appalling and refused me onto the flight. Literally on the button for gate closing time. I will never use FlySafair again, even if their fares are the cheapest.",0
"I like Air NZ, they never disappoint me, The aircraft was new Boeing 787, good inflight entertainment and service. The flight departed on time, and their app is awesome, they would constantly remind me of the incoming flight.",1
"Absolute nightmare. Bad customer service, rude terminal agents. Maintenance delay that caused us to loose our connecting flight. Put us in a hotel till next day. Lost our bag the next day. Arrived to hotel one day late still without bags. No one picks up phone numbers. Unbelievable stress. Not to mention loosing a lot of money and ruining the family vacation. On top of it they have the audacity to extremely be rude.",0
"Biman Bangladesh have significantly improved recently with six new 787 aircraft in a year. The flights was smooth, ontime, and the people are good. the foods are tasty but spicy. for entertainment they need to improve.",1
I booked the ticket for the next month and got it with incorrect gender. I wrote 4 complaints that was closed successfully but no action was taken. The worse service I have ever had. I am considering to cancel the ticket because I do not discover at the last moment that I could not fly because of mistake.,0
"I booked a flight for my brother and I to fly from Windsor to Halifax. Our flight was cancelled and I was given the option to receive a refund. I filled out the paperwork and received a message the next day that I was not eligible for a refund as I had rebooked. I did not rebook, I explicitly told them I wanted a refund, because the date that was offered was actually the day we were scheduled to return. If I were you, I wouldn't trust this airline. I am still fighting to try to get my refund.",0
"Berlin to Munich. What a disappointment this 50 mins flight was. 10 minutes late may seem not much, but it adds up. The service was really bad. Food served without bread. Service interrupted without getting a glass of water due to mild turbulence. One wonders what justifies the price paid for the ticket? Unless I have no other alternative, I will not fly this airline again.",0
"Brisbane to Kuala Lumpur via Bali. We were looking forward to a happy tour and decided to try a different airliner and book on Malindo Air. What a mistake. Don't look at prices when decided to fly. With the bad experience we had with Malindo Air we will steer away from this airline in future. We will never fly Malindo Air in our life again. Our flight returning home was canceled and were left on our own at the airport in Kuala Lumpur and had to arrange our own way to return to Australia. No support was provided and all dealings and enquiries were handled with an attitude of ""We don't care"". Airport personnel says we can book with any other airliner and claim a refund when returning to Australia. What a bull of crap. Back in Australia, the drama starts. We start with our claim and after many communications were advice that our claim for a refund was denied.",0
"For a lowcost airline, Kulula has a very good product. Liked that baggage is included. The airplane was clean and  the crew was smart, outstandingly friendly and very funny. They made so many jokes I primarily thought i wasn't flying but in a comedy show. Very impressive and still professional. Certainly recommended.",1
We would like to thank the Airport crew and flight MS995 crew from Cairo to Toronto for helping us clear our vaccine issue. Many thanks. Excellent service,1
TG 282 from Koh Samui to Bangkok. Service at the airport was polite and nice. Business class booked and paid for full fare. The seats were the worst I've seen. These BC seats were smaller than economy legroom. We were asked to move from the 2nd row of the plane to the first row as our 2 inch recline of the seat meant that a child could not open her tray table in the BC seat behind ours. We've cancelled all remaining Thai flights as a result.,0
"They cancelled our return flight's first leg and said they could reschedule it for 8 weeks later. This was not going to work as we had lives to return home to. We hassled them for days and eventually, they put us on the first leg a day before. We had to leave our accommodation in Rome early, pay for accommodation in Munich and taxis to and from the airport. They suggested we could get compensation for this but since applying for that we have heard nothing. A very stressful end to the trip and disappointing experience.",0
"Spirit Airlines provided the worst travel value I have received in 30 years of travel flying from Denver to Philadelphia via Ft. Lauderdale. The seats are thin and don't recline. My knees and legs were banging up against the fellow travelers on either side of me and the seat in front of me. You can't get a drink of water without paying for it. The price of my ticket was comparable to standard airline fees, but the service and product quality was far, far less at every turn. We waited for a pilot reporting late on the connecting flight. We waited 30 minutes to deplane in Ft. Lauderdale. Perhaps this is airport issue and not a airline issue, but I can't remember waiting 30 minutes to deplane on any other flight in 30 years. And then, they lost my luggage. I can't even think what the story line is going to be over the next few days while I wait for my luggage. This is a bad airline with a bad business model. ",0
"Porto to Brussels via Lisbon. I have travelled with TAP twice a month this year and every single flight I took were delayed. They are always late and you are almost always sure to miss your connection flight if you have one. To go to Porto I really advice you not to take TAP because it is a lost of time, you have a high probability to lose the connections. This company is a shame. The customer service is inefficient.",0
"After standing in line for what seemed like an eternity, what I thought was a good deal turned out to be as bad as Spirit Airlines, the same nickel and dime game, the hidden charges and surprises are endless, not to mention the lower bag weight limits, uncomfortable seats, no wifi or entertainment and to top it all off ridiculous expensive snacks on board. I will never fly this airline again, I thought I was saving some money, in the end turned out to be more expensive that any other airline. I strongly recommend you find another airline to give your money to.",0
Jakarta to Denpasar. Service is terrible. Flight was late for 2 hours. But we were informed about delay 15 minutes before the scheduled departure. Airport staff was just laughing when I tried to get any info about the flight. They didn't understand English. Very terrible company.,0
"Helsinki to Beirut via Istanbul. Never again will I travel by Turkish Airlines! I had a flight connection from Helsinki to Beirut, and both trips were late by 1 hour. I don't understand the delay! Also when on board the stewardess were very slow in serving the food and the drinks.",0
"Do not fly with Flair, terrible customer service that is non existent, terrible experience, no resolution for canceling our flight and leaving us stranded in Nashville, still no refund, support phone number says out of service and they don't have solutions or know how to work with the customer. Multiple calls, stay on hold for hours then drop. Cheap flights but also a scummy company. Don't waste your money with Flair, pay a little more to know you'll be taken care of by a reliable air travel provider. Your choice. First and last time I will be flying with Flair. On our departing flight they had 1 attendant to check everyone in which had us waiting in line for 2 hours, barely got to the flight on time. For our return flight no one was at the airport to answer our questions, the WestJet ladies said the Flair workers left the minute they found out the flight was canceled. Times were moved around to a 8am return flight causing us to have to cancel plans. Awful experience, I hate Flair.",0
"Flight was cancelled more than 2 weeks prior to departure for ""Operational reasons"". Attempted to secure a refund but it took over 2 weeks just to get a response. AirAsia, decided that, rather than a 5 hour transit, an alternative flight a day later with around 15 hours of travel was a sufficient substitute. Over 3 weeks later and I am still waiting to understand if I will receive a refund. Will never book with AirAsia again.",0
Awful experience. Little to no relevant communication. Cancelled a flight with no recourse. Absolutely no consideration for your time. You get what you pay for.,0
"Customer service non existent, in fact they had proudly announced it on all media, so its my fault that I ended up buying a ticket. Their chatting service is bogus, no use for any customer. Clearly no one in this company has brains, from CEO to the entry level employees. Only useful if you are travelling light and possible alone. Please dont consider this airline and especially dont include Frontier in any of your holiday or any key travel plans. If you do, do it at your own risk.",0
Las Vegas to Chicago. Unfortunately due to the corona virus my family and I are not able to attend my brother's boot camp graduation. Southwest is not honoring the military families for not being able to make it. There shouldn't be a problem refunding the military families. I thought Southwest was promilitary but clearly they are not. This would have been my first time flying Southwest and honestly I won't ever use them again. I feel like I have been robbed. Where is the human kindness?,0
"Austin to Philadelphia. I was nervous about flying with Frontier after reading so many horrible reviews but was pleasantly surprised.  Frontier made it very clear to me on their website that they charge for bags, seats, and additional drinks. I made sure that even with all the additional charges, that my ticket would be cheaper than the other airlines. If you're going to be flying with additional family members, perhaps you should not fly with Frontier because of all the additional costs. The seats are going to be less comfy and no outlets or TVs on the aircraft. That's how Frontier keeps its tickets cheap. I flew direct from Austin to Philly and back with no delays or issues. The flight attendants and pilots were very accommodating.  I did not pay for comfortable seats or sodas to drink on the plane. I would definitely fly with Frontier again for the amazingly cheap prices and efficiency!",1
"It's a pleasure to travel with Qantas. From the courteous check staff at London Heathrow which was very quick to the friendly helpful cabin staff who couldn't do enough to make the long flight as comfortable as possible. Good selection of movies and TV and all the equipment worked well which is not the case with some airlines. The food was excellent and it's a lovely touch to have the choice of snacks, fruit and drinks at the back to help yourself to. I even managed to get 6 hours sleep on the 13 hour flight from Dubai to Sydney.",1
"London to Bangkok via Beijing. Do not ever fly this airline. Not only were my flights delayed, but my luggage was lost for several days, with Air China taking absolutely no responsibility, except for the first day on which they told me that the place was unbalanced so they took my suitcase off.  Unhelpful aircraft staff, even had an argument in the aisle in front of us, shouting!",0
"Bangkok to Oslo. The flight was due to depart November 5 at 10.45 am. Delayed until 1.15 pm. Then zero communication until 4pm and flight cancelled. The Novotel hotel is nice. Food great. I assumed on the morning of the 6th an airline representative would be at the hotel, but no, hotel has provided the information. Flight delayed until November 7th at 9am, at 8 pm November 6th..flight delayed. Until November 8th at 5am! The airline lied to us all that an email was sent with each cancelled update. Nobody got an email. I asked for a refund. 3 nights at an airport hotel is ridiculous.",0
"I fly SW from San Jose to Ft Lauderdale and back several times a year. I too have been a victim of delays due to mechanical problems and sometimes bad weather. I suspect that all airlines have these issues. I love the witty banter of the safety announcements. If you are nice to the staff they will be nice to you. It is not their job to stuff your 90 lb. carry on into the overhead bin. The pilot decides when and if beverages and snacks will be served. I am a ""senior"" and remember the old days when people didn't feel so entitled as they board in their sweat pants or worse. It takes just one or two passengers to ruin a flight.",1
"Have had a totally horrible experience with Air Canada. They cancelled a flight on us due to mechanical issues and did not send notification of rebooking. Rebooked us for the next day but we couldn't get a in touch with anyone from reservations or support to see if there were other options as we had the flexibility to try another airport in the area. No one at the airport could help and they directed us to phones that supposedly went to their reservations support team. The phones said someone would answer quickly, but there were people there who had been on hold for more than an hour. After waiting on hold for over an hour, we gave up and went with the rebooking. Additionally, since the cancellation was due to a mechanical issue, we asked for a hotel voucher. They said they would not give it to us. We had traveled one way to Alaska for a cruise and this was the end of the cruise in Vancouver and we were trying to get home. They viewed this as we were ""originating"" our trip in Vancouver and therefore would only give us a voucher for a taxi to take us home and bring us back for the flight. Totally ridiculous. Then gave us a card to contact customer relations to get a reimbursed for the hotel and meal. Tried calling the phone number and it is not in service.",0
"3rd time on Air Europa and it has been a very satisfying experience. On time, clean and modern aircraft, friendly crew on the ground and on board. Never had an issue with them and I would be happy to fly them again.",1
"First class cabin staff service. I don't normally write reviews or make comments about service but I felt the urge to because the cabin crew on China Southern airlines was the best I have encountered. The staff on on my return trip from Guangzhou to Melbourne were professional, friendly and engaging. I would recommend flying with China Southern airlines and look forward to flying with them in the future.",1
"United has failed miserably at trying to be more efficient. I booked a flight for 2.30pm out of New Orleans to Louisville with a layover in Houston. My original flight was delayed for a total of an hour. Told twice it was only 20 more min. Due to a ""technical"" issue. Then when we finally took off, we landed as the connecting flight was leaving. We landed at 4.30 and was told the next available was 8.10. It is now 9.10 pm as I type this. Delayed 2 more times on the 8.10 flight...due to ""Technical"" issues then told to deplane and the next flight is 10.30 if they can find a plane. I knew I should have booked Southwest, but trying to save a few bucks and got this. United is terrible....I also have flight credit, I have tried to use 10 times and am told it's not valid for those dates...10 different dates and all are not valid? United will no longer get my business and you should avoid them as well.",0
"The airline had misplaced my luggage and after raising the issue at the Airlines baggage claims section, I was provided a contact number and told to call the number the next day and it will be sorted in a day or two. I've been trying to reach them since the past three days but no one answered the calls. I wasn't expecting this kind of attitude from the staffs. I'm giving this review for the pathetic service from the ground staff handling the baggage section",0
"Dusseldorf to Larnaca via Zurich, and it was the first time I flew with Edelweiss Air. I was satisfied with the high standards and service provided. The flight lasted 3 hours and the crew served the passengers the snack, meal, dessert. Metal cutlery was provided to all passengers instead of plastic.",1
"Hamilton to Varadero. We flew out Saturday jan 18 of 2020 only to be delayed five hours out of Hamilton airport was to arrive at 7pm but landed at 1230 am then we get through customs go to retrieve suitcase not there. Then when we were to fly back home we were to land at 12 midnight but it was 3.30 in the morning, so overall eight hours lost plus suitcase for three days. Put in a compensation report to sunwing they reply back is no compensation. I've never experienced such bad service. I will never fly Sunwing airlines again.",0
Orlando to New York. Cancelled the flight. 3 hours waiting on the phone to talk to customer service. They want to charge me again for choosing seats.,0
"Tehran to Kiev. Normally I don't rate bad service but this flight with Ukraine International was so terrible. The plane was awfully old, seats were so tight, aisles were so narrow and cabin staff services was poor. It's not worth a penny.",0
"Unprofessional flight attendant, appeared to be having a bad day. They also changed my seat just to satisfy another customer. I will try to avoid flying American Airlines for the rest of my life.",0
LX1934 April 16 2014. Friendly and very competent crew. Enthusiastic pilots. Good service. Planes in good condition. Clean cabin. Rather poor onboard menu. No special comfort onboard.,1
Economy Paris to Doha and then Business from Doha to CPT. Flight from Paris left late so I missed my connection in Doha. Ground staff waiting on my arrival to take me to transfer desk to make alternative arrangements. All done very professionally. Put on the following day's flight and overnight in a hotel in Doha at no additional cost. Doha's new airport is stunning. I used the business lounge on the morning of my revised flight and it was spacious modern with great food. The flight in business to CPT was superb. Very comfortable seat in the new Dreamliner with excellent entertainment attentive staff and good food options. Highly recommended.,1
"Garuda Indonesia is a full service airlines and it really shows it. From my experience, Jakarta to Bangkok was an excellent flight. The flight was punctual as there is no delay. The cabin crew work very efficiently and gave smiles to everyone onboard. However IFE really need to be updated with more movies.",1
"Even if the aircraft was an old one, the seatpitch was more than enough compared with newer aircrafts. The flight lasted almost 3 hours and I did not need inflight entertainment, neither WiFi, which were both non existent on board. Cabin crew very attentive and smiling. They served a hot meal which was very good for a 3 hour flight and a wide variety of beverages. Departure and arival on time. As a frequent flyer, I recommend Tarom because they serve good food on board and they have an overall good service. The best word to describe my flights with Tarom is classic.",1
Orlando to Dallas. I will never fly America Airlines again. They delayed the flight like 8 times and I have sat in the airport for 6 hours and when I asked questions nothing but attitude. American airlines suck and I will never fly them again.,0
"Jakarta to Kuala Lumpur. The crew on KLM are so friendly and accommodating. Amenity kit handed out with menus and hot towels. Welcome drink served champagne. For dinner I had beef lasagne, also served with chicken satay entree and mango cake for dessert. Seat was comfortable and entertainment had lots of content. Thank you to the KLM crew for being awesome.",1
The seat assigned to me was 10C. When I got on the plane the headrest was broken and dangling down the seat back? Why had no one tried to fix it? What a splendid first impression. The toilet at the back of the plane smelt disgusting. I asked a flight attendant if they at least had some kind of spray to alleviate the stench and she grudgingly produced something and stuck her hand around the door and squirted. I have flown several times on this airline recently and the thing that leaves a lasting impression is the complete lack of interest shown by the cabin crew in their jobs. Very disappointing. ,0
"Singapore to Beijing. Took this flight in Apr 2018, the aircraft was pretty new, spacious, I reserved the ""Book the cook"" service prior to departure, the inflight meal was really premium, especially the lobster with rice. The inflight entertainment system was perfect, the screen was big. Ground staffs were friendly, same as the cabin crews.",1
Have just returned from Kefalonia with Thomas Cook in a 757 aircraft and have to say I have never encountered or endured so much discomfort from a seat. I am 6ft tall and weigh 16 stones and was by no means the largest person on this particular flight. I just managed to fit in the seat and found that my knees were pressed hard against the seat in front with my legs apart. I paid for an inflight meal but was unable to eat it properly as the tray came down against my tummy due to the massive size of the hinges on the tray the food when made was probably ok but after flying from the UK first found gravy in chicken dinner all dried out. All large gentlemen around me were also complaining about the leg room and tempers became evident as the ignorant people sitting in front who think they must put their seats in a reclined position for a three hour flight.,0
Flew from Honolulu to Newark return in First. Flew Alaska last year in first and was so impressed booked with them again. Great service and the meals are just some of the best I have had on a plane. Flights were on time except for a delay because of weather but that's flying for you. Cant blame the airline for that. The staff are helpful and polite. Love the small first class of only 16 seats. Makes it feel like being on a small business jet as very individual service. Again well done to Alaska and would fly with them again.,1
"HOP! is the regional carrier of Air France. I flew from Brive Vallee de la Dordogne to Paris on AF 5523 at 5.50 pm. When it was almost time to board I was surprise that no one went through security. Looked at the monitor, nothing special. Look at the AF app and I saw that the plane which was suppose to leave in fact went back to Paris due to a technical problem. No announcement and when I met the ground staff they told me they could not say anything, that's why we had no announcement. Half an hour later, the flight was cancelled and it was the last flight of the day. Hop chartered a bus to drive us to Toulouse 130 miles south, a bus with no air conditioning and we had a heatwave in France. Of course not a bottle of water, not a voucher to get a sandwich. Hop in Brive was suppose to book the flight between Toulouse and Paris and of course, they did not. We had the chance to board the last flight to Paris at 9.10 pm. To be short a nightmare with a terrible ground flight, no apologies. We were nothing for the staff in Brive.",0
"Flew Copenhagen to Amsterdam. I booked a ticket at the SAS website. I also booked an upgrade at the SAS website. SAS has confirmed the upgrade. When I checked in, I saw that SAS did not give me the upgrade seat which I paid for. I called customer service SAS Denmark. They told me that customer service was not entitled by SAS to correct the mistake. SAS told me also that I could not get my money back. The flight was cancelled and I booked another airline. This is fraud. I do not recommend SAS when you go to Denmark, Sweden or Norway.",0
"Phoenix to Syracuse via Newark. I purchased my ticket a month before my departure date. I got to the airport and everything was fine. I paid for my carry on bags and got on the plane. We ended up having to land the plane in Atlanta because of weather. The staff told us we should only have a few hours layover and be back up in the air. A few hours passed by and we were told to board the plane. We all got on and sat for 30 minutes then we're told to get back off because there was no pilot. That itself annoyed me because it's a waste of time. We were told we had to stay in Atlanta. They gave me my carry on bag because everything I needed was in it and since I was going to be stuck in the airport over night I wanted to brush my teeth and use deodorant and have my phone charger to charge my phone. After the staff gave me my carry on bags. I was told I'd have to pay the baggage fee again. This delay and overnight stay in the airport is not my problem and I didn't feel like I should have to pay for my bag again. Ridiculous. I told the staff is there anyway they could accommodate for unexpected food and bag fee to wave it and maybe give me a voucher for food. I was told by all the staff that because I was a solo traveler, that they would not make any exceptions for me and told me they have more important things to deal with. I explained to them that my bank had locked my card because I tried to use it in the airport so I had no money and it was to late to contact my bank. The only cash I had on me had to go towards this carry on bag fee. The staff told me they could not help me and I needed to go find a spot to relax until the next plane had a seat for me. I am extremely upset with the carry on bag fees, the staff were very rude not only to me but everyone. I am upset that we had to sleep in the airport over night with no food or drinks offered to us. No blankets and they charged me another carry on bag fee because I needed my bag due to being stuck in the airport. I will never fly with United Airlines again. Extremely rude staff have no sympathy for people at all.",0
Montreal to Toronto. I flew around 200 flights in last 3 years with WestJet on diffrent routes. Their service is getting poor to worst. WestJet flights never leave on time and famous for endless delays. If you have a connection flight or looking for timely flight. Please do not use Westjet.,0
"Madrid to Paris. Worst experience with delays followed by cancellation with no announcement, no hotel booking. Flight itself is very bad, seats unconfortable, staff unfriendly. They do not even offer free water or coffee. Never again",0
Doha to Amman via Kuwait. The worst ever experience with international flight. Delays from the beginning to the end of the whole trip. Small transit halls limited to the gates some times. Delays vary from 3 hours to more than one day if the connection flight is missed due to the delay. Have to argue with company representatives to solve the rescheduling the missing flight. Keep on insisting on the partial refund which were not enough to cover a replacement flight.,0
Worst airline I have travelled.  No update in the website even 90 min before the scheduled departure for any delay of the flight .So they want flyers to wait for hours at the airport and waste their precious time. The staff behave badly with the passengers. Difference of fare is now not compared to other non low cost airlines. So please don't choose this airlines even at very low price.,0
I will never in my life fly Spirit again. They canceled our flight all together then says it was a mistake so they re booked us again so somehow when they re booked us and the prices went up. We already paid for bags so when they re booked us. From having an issue on there end they say you guys still have to pay for bags. I said we already paid for bag fees. It's nothing but a money scheme with them. They don't take care of their customers when they company make a mistake.,0
"Durban to Johannesburg. Worst airline ever! Most people book this airline as it is slightly cheaper than other domestic carriers. It's much better to pay a couple hundred more and be on time than have to encounter the 2 hour delay that usually plagues this airline! I booked a round trip, was delayed by about 2 hours on both trips. Totally unreliable. Will not use this airline again.",0
"Southwest cancelled 2 of my flights in the last month just hours prior to the flight leaving. They blame it on weather. United had no trouble taking us as we had to pay through the nose to fly last minute. I used to sing their praises, not any more. Cost me a small fortune. Cancelling their credit card and never flying them again. Use them if you don't need to get where you are on time or when you want. Hopefully the competition will put them out of business.",0
"Moscow to Singapore via Dubai. Spacious and comfortable A380 planes, excellent seats and lots of fresh air in the cabin. A380 surely provides a more relaxing and smooth flying experience. Convenient and easy transfer at Dubai. All flights were on time. Very attentive and courteous service, good food and drinks. Great entertainment system with lots of new and interesting movies. Unprecedented value for money.",1
"WOW air is a budget travel airline. Baggage fees, paying for food, etc is disclosed on their website. Bring your own food, snacks and drinks on board are expensive. Bring an empty waterbottle, fill it after security. Or, factor paying for your drink into the price of wow air. Factor bags into price. For me, I brought my school sized backpack and managed to fit a week of clothes into it.  Every airline has delays, late flights or even cancellations. I flew 4 flights, and one of my flights was delayed two hours.  Wow air is a great way to travel cheaply.",1
After getting up at 04.30 am for flight from Manchester to Malaga got to the Airport at 05.30 for 07.25 flight told change of plane. Told if we wished to travel today would have to get a coach to Gatwick for a later flight. Arrived Malaga 9 hrs Late. Had to incur extra costs.,0
"Absolutely rubbish airline. Lost my bag on 2 flights already, which i can forgive since these things happen. But they were so rude at the reporting office, as if they had their own bags lost, refused to compensate for things i had to buy since it was lost 5 days and had all my things inside and then refused to deliver to my address like they promised and instead dropped it off at a bus station 2hrs away from my house. Their customer service are clueless and the ground staff rude. Not worth the cheaper prices,",0
Florence to Gatwick. Flight delayed by just over 3hrs due to an accumulation of technical problems. Little attempt at apology when boarding did take place and the plane had to wait on the tarmac for 30 mins because there was no slot. With one notable exception the cabin crew were distant and unfriendly. I would not advise anyone to book tickets with Vueling.,0
"I am very unsatisfied. Not one of my flights from San Francisco to Mobile return via Houston was on time. My flight back to  obile was even more horrible. First they couldn't find an airplane, the lady at the boarding ramp at SFO was very rude and not willing to help and wouldn't tell me her name. After arriving to Houston, I got put on a flight scheduled to leave hours later and then got delayed again for aircraft maintenance! And again the staff was rude. This was my first flight with United Airlines and will probably be my last. I am scheduled to be at work at the hospital in 5hrs and I have not had sleep from being stuck out of state at airports.",0
"Dallas to Reykjavik. American Airlines did a wonderful job in business class. The flight attendants were friendly, helpful, and attentive. The food was excellent especially the salmon. The movie selection was great. Sound system was wonderful. They kept the toilets clean. I normally use foreign carriers when in business, but I have no complaints about this airline. Plus they arrived on time.",1
Fly regularly with Ryanair from Leeds Bradford to Alicante and back. Have never been delayed. You are only buying a cheap seat and you do not have to buy anything else. You are only on the plane for a short time and reclining seats and fancy service are not an issue.,1
"I would like to thank the Pegasus team in Istanbul for the service and hard work they provide in this difficult time after Turkey suffered from the earthquake. The flight was delayed 2 hours and I missed my connecting flight. Considering the whole situation on the country and bad weather conditions, I suppose that delays may happen. Pegasus provided me with another ticket, free hotel stay till my next flight and food. Thank you.",1
"Guangzhou to Toronto in business class. It was a good experience for both ground and air service in general. The seat in business class was very comfortable. I had a very good rest during the trip as staff communicated with me for meal arrangement before took off. The traditional Chinese food on board was delicious. Though it costed me more for direct flight compared with connecting one, it was worth the fare because of service.",1
"Brisbane to Okinawa via Taipei. As a noticably pregnant woman flying with China I was disgusted with the staff. Not one of them acknowledged I was pregnant or bothered to help me get my bags into the overhead compartment, whenever I talked to staff there was thinly veiled contempt in their gaze, demeanor and voices. I was not a customer but problem. As an Australian I have never been treated like this by any other airline. On embarkation the cabin was thick with the smell of body odor, unclean, musty. The seats are crammed in like sardines and the food is disgusting. It was a read eye flight and they kept the lights on and fed us dinner at 2am when all I wanted to do was sleep, the flight was super bumpy and I did not feel safe with the condition of the inside of the plane surely making me wonder about the maintenance of the plane mechanics.",0
"We consistently use Cape Air to travel from Bos to MV. However over the years the service has significantly declined. More often we see rude employees, and and unreliable service. Flights almost never depart on time and are almost always rescheduled. We are normally flexible and can roll it, and are happy to! However we are seeing more often that a reschedule occurs less than 30 days in advance, and leaves us empty handed as our new scheduled time departs before our connecting flights even arrives. This is just standard with Cape Air now a days.",0
My Spirit Airlines experience was a good one.  I flew round trip from Latrobe to Orlando. I was quite pleased with my experience with them. The most negative thing I would have to say is read things very carefully about the bags and such. I missed checking a bag for my return flight when I initially booked my flights. I added it on when I realized my mistake and ended up paying a little more for the bag. Lesson learned. For heavens sake allow enough time to get through check in and TSA security!,1
"I was traveling from Bahrain to Mumbai on 7 January. There was fracture in my right knee, so I was coming India for treatment. I am very happy with the staff service, the cabin supervisor she provided a wheelchair for me on landing time and she treated me very well with her good communication and better servings.",1
Ranchi to New Delhi. Extremely poor services. Flight delayed with no information. No staff ready to talk at the airport and behaving as a layman. Extremely poor. Feared of missing my next flight from Delhi as it would put me in a heavy economic and social loss.,0
"Bhubaneshwar to Mumbai. Pathetic customer service. The helpdesk people have no idea hot to talk to customers and listen to their problem. We tried to prebook the excess baggage international, but the payment did not go through under my name. We rechecked the booking several times for any link to appear through which we can complete the payment. We also waited for an email, but did not get any. In the booking it did not show anything neither did it informed us to pay at the counter while boarding. Then, we again prebooked the excess baggage international. This time the payment went through. Then we went to the airport for taking the flight. The helpdesk people said that we have to pay 2500 for the pre baggage under my name which we did not need at all, as we already had it under her name. They were not at all helpful to us. They did not listen to what we wanted to say and were rude also, their argument was the following. ""The extra service once added can't be removed."" To my defence, I had not completed the purchase. So how can it be mine until I buy it. Just because I see a product and like it you can't force me to buy it. His argument holds true if I had paid for it and then asked to remove it.",0
I had an open ticket with this company. I have called them at least thirty times and stayed on the phone for hours with their customer service. They booked me a ticket telling me that a fare difference should be paid and I will get a call from them as soon as their fare was approved. They never called me back. When I called them again they told me that the calculation that the previous agent has done was wrong and a new reservation has to be done. This happed three times in a row. An inefficient company that uses mischievous tactics to stop people benefit their open credit.,0
"Singapore to Zurich in May 2014 at 01.20am. Not really the time to everybody embarking a plane. Even though cabin crew is professional and friendly with a smile. This time we got a seat near the lavatories, it was surprisingly quiet. My online preordered special meal was delicious. The inflight entertainment needed an urgent upgrade in 2014. Even the flightpath has seen its better years.",1
London to Athens. My parents recently travelled with Aegean business class and I have used the service before. The service is superb and the staff well trained and very helpful. On behalf of my parents who are an old couple I congratulate the airline and staff for their support and professionalism with passengers who need help. The menu and wines from different regions of Greece deserve special recommendation.,1
I flew round trip to Papeete for a Paul Gauguin cruise. I will never fly that airline again. This is unfortunate for French Polynesia because it is a wonderful place and I loved my time there the the flight was unbearable. The seats are so small with no leg room so that one can hardly move. The country should subsidize the airline or another one so that passengers can visit this beautiful place without the pain associated with getting there.,0
"The app is impossible to use and will not let you see your reservation. On the contrary it keeps telling you that it cannot find your booking.  Very strict procedure at check in regarding your luggage weight and also the carry on weight. The plane was almost full. The seats were hard and not comfortable, cramped. They don't give any water or meal free.  Don't expect any flight entertainment system there is no screen no USB port nothing at all. So if you don't have a phone with movies or a couple of books, prepare yourself for a very long boring flight in a uncomfortable seat that makes it impossible to get any good rest. Then there was the transit at Singapore airport which was okay. Singapore to Bangkok was delayed by about 1 hour on departure when everybody was sitting on the plane and waiting without information. Because you cannot use your earphones before taking off and landing , as it would endanger your security if you cannot hear what the pilot would have to say, at least was the reply when I questioned their policy. They also have you straighten the seats and there again remove your earphones 15 minutes before landing.  This was a long haul flight followed by another one that was delayed by one hour with aggressive crew members. I would never fly with Scoot again even if it means paying more.",0
"Cairns to Melbourne and back on Dec 1st. Both flights delayed for more than one hour. In Cairns, we were explained that the delay is due to ATC, however all the flights by the competitor were on time. Another delay on my way back. Moreover, at Melbourne domestic airport, all the shops and coffee outlets are closed at 10pm. Plane was not comfortable at all with a very limited leg room. When compared to European low cost airlines, which I am using frequently, this one was nowhere close. Information regarding the actual boarding time in both Cairns and Melbourne were chaotic. Overall, disappointing experience.",0
"Johannesburg to Durban. When arriving at Durban on the 6th of April 2022, my luggage never arrived. I was directed to the Swissport counter to report the missing luggage and was told that they will locate my luggage and have it delivered to my hotel. It is now the 9th of April and I have since returned to Johannesburg and still no bag, no answers and no way of following up or receiving feedback. I have tried the Flysafair customer careline, where I've just been looped from one automated response to the next, with no options relating to missing luggage. I've have chatted to at least 3 agents on the WhatsApp line, but as soon I describe my problem the agents logged and sends a message that my query has been resolved, which it certainly has not. I have no spent my entire Saturday at a small office in OR Tambo trying to get someone to assist me with finding my luggage. Absolutely horrendous experience!",0
"Orlando to Minneapolis. Flight SY342, 2 hour delay at departure Orlando, staff was very rude. On the way to Florida we have the front seats no problem fitst isle, and on the way back seats 31 all the way in the back. I Asked the staff if these seats recline and she says, do they look like it.",0
"Flew into Dallas with elderly parents yesterday. Took them to the airport today for another, short flight home. My father is disabled and requires a wheel chair, which was supposed to have been arranged before they ever left home 10 days ago. He is 84. My mother is 80. The desk agent requested a wheel chair, which was delivered. She said, ""here you go! "" No attendant, no help was provided as arranged prior. My mom had to push my dad to the gate herself. Masks are required in airports and on planes right now as everyone knows. Yesterday, while we were waiting for our flight to depart from North Carolina, quite a few passengers were not wearing masks in the waiting area. Same true on the plane. Not one AA employee asked these passengers to wear their masks. What's the point of a mandate, if a major player like AA doesn't enforce the rules? Lip service only? No one likes wearing a mask, but most of us do out of respect for fellow travelers. I think you may have forgotten that we are the customer. It's about us not you!",0
"I had the best flight experience ever on June 24, 2021 from Kona to San Diego. The flight attendants were caring and made the flight easy and enjoyable. I am a runner so I needed to stretch a little in the back near the lavatories and the flight attendant I spoke with was extremely affable and understanding. I hadn't planned on any more than 5 mins but I struck a conversation with the attendant sitting in back and I was particularly impressed with her demeanor.  Thank you amazing flight attendant!",1
Flew Tokyo to Beijing and Beijing to Singapore and back. Nice flights all round. The aircraft's were comfortable and clean. Service was efficient particularly the ground staff who guided us very nicely through a short transit time. We had excellent service on the Singapore to Beijing portion but the Chinese foreign minister was on the same flight. Otherwise the service was efficient and the food was very presentable without being spectacular. Seat was fantastic and the full flat seats a joy to use. However I would recommend their business class as being a reliable comfortable product. A bit more work and it would be truly spectacular.,1
Montego Bay to Fort Wayne via Charlotte. I have flown with American airlines 4 times and this was the worst. Got notification that our flight from Jamaica to Charlotte was delayed by an hour. Once we got to the airport it was an hour and a half and we miss our connection in Charlotte by 5min. Couldn't just let me stay in Jamaica another day. Need to give more notice for this. I had to spend the night in Charlotte. Not happy at all. Couldn't hold that flight to Fort Wayne being it was their fault or book another one. I know they got enough planes. Had to wait until 1130 the next morning and of course it was over booked they said. But once on the plane there where open seats. I paid in advance for upgrade seating and of course with this flight my husband and i didn't even get to sit together. Don't think I will be flying with them any more.,0
"Malaysia Airlines flight MH53 from Osaka to Kuala Lumpur on A330.  On time departure and announcement made in Malay, English and Japanese. FA from time to time will walk within the cabin and to make sure that everybody is well taken care of. Friendly and attentive cabin crew, nice inflight food with personal touch screen IFE. The leg room is adequate, it comes with a small pillow and a purple blanket. Bigger than average toilet. A clean and nice cabin experience.",1
Flew on Virgin Little Red to EDI from LHR on the VS3005. The flight left on time we even got a complimentary drink and snack! The cabin crew members are super friendly and both crew that actually served us added to the experience. I must also say the ground staff where friendly too! Aircraft lovely and purple so Virgin! Great trip and compared to BA amazing fare! Terminal 2 at Heathrow is lovely and easy!! Great option and value for money better value than the train!,1
"Adelaide to Bangkok via Hong Kong. Both flights on time, with the good service. Seats were comfortable and food was decent. IFE had a great choice with decent size touch screen. As a One World Platinum member, the lovely Purser made sure that I was comfortable all the time.",1
Booked for us through Viking. Economy is what I would call 4th class. I guess it was cheap and that is why it could be included with the cruise package. I think I would have opted to pay a little more for a different airline. Long trip with no food service and my one leg in the middle seat was very uncomfortable. I was very happy the pilots were on strike and we were changed to a direct flight on Air France with 2 meals free choice of beverage including champagne. Much more comfortable seat etc.,0
"Our flight was delayed so we were late arriving in Lisbon for our connecting flight. There was an agent waiting for us outside of customs who ran all the way to the gate with us since it was getting ready to close. In today's world I find this very refreshing and am grateful. We would not have made the plane if she had not been there. The staff on the plane was very professional, food good and seats comfortable.",1
Flew Boston to Paris April 19th. Flight was cancelled so missed a day of my vacation and list two scheduled tours. Food was good. Return trip flight on April 27th was cancelled again. Paris to Boston. They kept the luggage so I had no personal items. The flight ran out of food so I had no dinner and my movie screen was broken along with many other customers. The flight attendants didn't do much for me. Barely got an apology. Won't fly Air France ever.,0
London Heathrow to Dubai with Qantas for the first time. Warm welcome from crew to good quality pillow and blanket compared to other airlines nice food great service and what an awesome A380 experience. I will definitely fly with them again.,1
Dallas Ft Worth to Denver. When I arrived at 4.45am an tried to check in for my flight I was told I had to be at the airport an be checked in two hours in advance of the departure. I was in line with five other people who which all was declined to be ticketed to be able to go through TSA. The was a lady who cut in line while we waited to speak with a manager an was given her ticket and was able to board the plane.,0
Excellent check in at Saint Petersburg with very friendly staff. Immigration was fast. Shared Lounge was quiet and peaceful.  Short flight with very friendly crew. My second flight to Oslo with efficient Check in. Nice Finnair lounge at Helsinki even though offerings were limited. Left and arrived on time. Very good crew friendly and efficient. Seat pitch not bad for short flight. Bags out fast hence no complaints.,1
"This was my first time in frontier. Flight was over 2 hours delayed and running behind, and they held everyone checking bag sizes and while up charging fees, also for my backpack. I have traveled many places with the same backpack but no one ever said anything but here they stopped me while boarding and asked to step aside. They are rude and not at all customer friendly. Never flying Frontier again.",0
"Never thought that this can be allowed in US. Lost flight from Orlando to Nashville due to Spirit being understaffed at check in. Why provide kiosks to print boarding passes and luggage tags, if you have to wait 1 hour to turn checked in luggage in? After half the plane missed the flight because their outrageous lack of will to help departing flights, they offered to rebook us 3 days later. One completely untrained and ignorant agent, was assigned to rebook more than 20 people that missed the flight to BNA alone. Had to wait 2 hours to be told I either wait 3 days to fly from Orlando to Nashville, or go to expedia and find another ticket.",0
Dec 26 flight 451 PBG to FLL. Jan 6 flight 450 FLL to PBG. Spirit is one of my favorite airlines for the price. I fly o Fort Lauderdale to Plattsburgh every 2 weeks. Price is cheap for airline with fleet of all new A320 aircrafts. Almost on time except for bad weather.,1
Bangkok to Los Angeles via Seoul. Asiana is great! Food is brilliant. Service is excellent. The staff are very polite and helpful from ground staff to cabin crews. No attitude. I would definitely fly with them again.,1
Baku to Sharjah. The first time flying Air Arabia. I travel so much but no any other airlines given such bad treatment. They give us separate seats to my and my husband both way coming and going. I am lady sitting separated from husband and some unknown men was sitting to near me for whole journey. T We ask them to give same sit at registration counters but the staff was so bad. They are not supporting at all. I never fly with Air Arabia any more in future.,0
My flight from Dublin to Milan went well. It was the return flight from Rome to Dublin when the nightmare began. The flight was due at 9.00 pm it did not arrive we given no explanation for this. At midnight we were bussed to another airport escorted by Italian police. Then bussed back to the first airport. Finally we flew out at 6pm the next day. I will never fly Ryanair again I will pay the extra money to another airline for a better service.,0
"I book a Thai airways ticket fro Kathmandu to Sydney, I got a notice later that trip from Kathmandu to Bangkok was cancelled. Later know that Thai airways was never operating from Kathmandu to Bangkok now day. I asked a refund but it has been 1 month they are ignoring.",0
"I fly domestically and internationally a great deal and use Southwest to get from Sacramento to LAX for international connections and to Orange County to visit family. One of the flight attendants from Sacramento to Burbank was rude and dismissive and actually embarrassed one traveler in front of the rest of us. At Burbank today on the flight back to Sacramento, I went to the counter to pay for a better seating position and the attendant was rude and dismissive. Is this a new policy on the part of Southwest? I have been flying for 65 years all over the world and most other airlines go out of their way to be kind, welcoming and make your journey the most positive experience possible. Why not Southwest?",0
"A great way to save some money. When traveling for a week, I can really get by with just hand luggage. Of course everything is extra like seat assignments and extra space, but that's expected with Economy class.  The staff was very friendly.The food was ok. The check in process and communications was excellent for those with a smartphone. Overall the experience was excellent. On time take off and arrival. I will use them again in the future.",1
I have made the Qantas flight from Wellington to Sydney sixteen times in the last year flying Business Class. The food was consistently poor. The inflight service was excellent. Inflight entertainment was excellent. Have a good meal before departure.,0
"Brisbane to Port Hedland via Perth. I fly with Qantas a lot for work and have done for leisure, and I just don't get why it's expensive to fly and the customer service is very poor. Contacting them is very difficult and using their chat service online is only useful if you have a whole day to waste on waiting for them to reply. It's a chat Qantas not email. I definitely would not recommend using them. It seems like they have a bee in their bonnet when they don't realise that we are the customers.",0
"Short flight from Paris to Madrid but excellently executed by Air France. Check in simple and fast, fast track through passport and security, fabulous lounge with nice breakfast available. Efficient boarding, new comfortable aircraft with friendly staff. Flight arrived on time. Air France consistently performs.",1
"Christchurch to Bali via Melbourne. Terrible airline, would rather pay extra from now on. Canceling flights 24hr prior and giving a worse flight without telling us. Never again Jetstar, now 17hr flight.",0
Sevilla to Barcelona. Three times flying with this company and three times delayed and arriving late to destination. Perhaps one of the most unreliable flying company.,0
"On November17 2021 when we were ready to depart from Dubai for DFW,  I asked supervisor to change my seat, she asked me to pay. I told her I am not asking upgrading. I told her Emirates is not like before it used to be and she said she will call the security. I am not fighting or screaming, why would you call Security? My friends told me Emirates is not like before and to travel Qatar Airways, but I didn't listen to them. I had old Emirates in my mind when I used to travel from Uk during 1990 until 2007.",0
American cancelled three flights and over booked two others. We couldn't get out of Houston and as a result we missed our cruise out of Barbados. They shipped our bags to Barbados and after four days we still don't have our bags. This airline demonstrated gross incompetence and stupidity in getting staffing to fly their planes. Pay extra to fly another airline. I have not flown AA in many years and I will never fly with them again.,0
Great flight from JFK NY to Schipol. Great service good hot food. Had to change flights for return folks at Schipol were very accommodating and courteous. Got back to JFK and realized how awful NY is compared to Holland.,1
Very incompetent staff. My flight was from Antalya to Amsterdam connecting to Reykjavik with Icelandair. The check oin officer was supposed to check my bags from Antalya to Amsterdam as my arrival time to Istanbul was 9 am and my flight to Amsterdam was at 1030. By the time I collected my bags the counter was closed. I tried to get help but was asked to talk to many incompetent people including the manager and sales office with no benefit. I had to buy new tickets through Turkish airlines. Avoid Pegasus airlines at all costs.,0
"Prague to London. A two hour flight on 27th July was delayed by 3 hours with no heads up given by BA. There was no sympathy or compensation , especially as our original flight was early morning, and with an email informing us of the delay, we could have stayed longer in the hotel.",0
"After flying around the USA for the past month on numerous different airlines, I experienced no better inflight service than with Alaskan Airlines. From the moment I arrived at the gate to board and the plane trip itself their staff and cabin service was exceptional. They were extremely friendly and helpful making sure everyone was comfortable, happy and had everything they needed and wanted. I wish I had flown with Alaskan Airlines more on this trip.",1
"8 of us were booked for a flight on Norwegian Airlines from Oakland to Stockholm. Then the day of departure we were notified that we would be flying on HiFly Airlines instead. First, we had ordered assigned seats so that we could sit together because we had a 2.5 yr. old in our group and wanted to be able to help care for this first time flyer. We were not given seats together. Secondly, the planes air was not individually adjustable and the plane became very hot and stuffy throughout the flight. Thirdly, we were not offered water or drinks except during a meal and were told we could only have 1 drink per person throughout the 10 hour flight. That is unhealthy and unsafe. Fourthly, there was no entertainment in English including the children's cartoons. Also when cabin lights were dimmed for sleep the lights where food is prepped were not and the whole plane was starring into the lights. So needless to say the flight was horrible.",0
Stockholm to Copenhagen. One of the best flights I have done. Super quick and on time. The cabin crew were amazing and the customer service provided was excellent. Super quick boarding and super comfortable.,1
"After securing a place for my carryon in the above compartment, i sat in my seat and waited for take off. About 5 min later the stewardess took my carryon down and handed it to me. She replaced my carryon with another persons suitcase. When I pointed out that i already had a personal item below the seat in front of me and that the bag she handed to me was my carryon. She told me they have no space for carryon and walked off. I was left holding my carryon on my lap for the duration of the flight. My carryon gymbag is smaller than some of the other carryons on the flight. However my ticket assures that i would be able to stow that item. I am beyond annoyed and irritated with not only the i convenience of holding my bag but the rudeness of the stewardess. This was an uncalled for situation",0
"Allegiant Air has perhaps the worst customer service of any airline in the US. Gate agents are not friendly or helpful. They can not adjust baggage fares or do anything outside of shoving you on the plane. When you need assistance you are handed a piece of paper with a phone number to call. When you call, you have a minimum 30 minute wait to speak to a human. This is particularly frustrating when there are 4 helpless human agents standing in front of you. After you pay all of their fees, it really isn't any cheaper than one of the bigger, more reliable and better customer service airlines. Don't waste your time or money with Allegiant Air. ",0
"Singapore to Jakarta. Spotless cabin, cabin crew was gracious, polite and helpful. Food and drink service on board was very good. Inflight entertainment could be better but acceptable. Next time I definitely choose Garuda again. Next time I will try the business class.",1
"I had an extremely frustrating experience with Allegiant's customer service and refund process. After I could not check my bag 45 minutes before my flight, thus not being able to board, I spent hours on the phone trying to reach a representative to assist me with an insurance refund. When I finally got through, the customer service agent was unhelpful and dismissive, offering little to no assistance. Furthermore, when I requested a refund, I was told I needed to cancel my flight an hour before takeoff. If I knew I could not check my bag 45 minutes before the flight, I would have done so. Overall, the customer service and refund process provided by Allegiant was utterly unsatisfactory, and I will not be choosing to fly with you in the future.",0
East Midland to Faro 30th April. Amazed at the improvements. No scratch cards no continual announcements staff great and very smart. Transformed from my last flight. I used to avoid Ryanair and I fly 20 times a year. Pushing and shoving nasty staff and anything to get more money but yesterday was great and I will definitely use them a lot more.,1
"Flight to Toronto delayed over 5 hours resulting in missed connect and waited over an hour on the phone only for them to disconnect the line. Arrive in Toronto at 0050 and they say we aren't helping you we're closed and that they understand. What a joke, you understand as you go home and we are stranded in the airport. Not the first time this has happened. Last time coming home from Costa Rica only i didn't have the energy to fight for my refund or any kind of compensation.",0
"Denver to Los Angeles. Good flight overall. Friendly staff. Soft landing. Tired of hearing about the credit card offer. Yes, we're a captive audience, please stop exploiting this.",1
"Bilbao to Madrid. The flight was delayed due to thunderstorm in Madrid. No problem, this happens and the crew too well care of us whilst waiting. The plane looked new and fresh. But the seats were just terrible. I cannot recall having experienced such little legroom and narrow seats ever. Padding was hard and table, armrest very small. Recline not possible. Other than that, all well and no complaints",0
Flew TAP Portugal from LHR to LIS for a long weekend in Lisbon. The price was cheaper then BA. Both flights arrived early to Heathrow what is awesome! The staff was friendly and was served with some lovely Portuguese wine! Cant say anything wrong!,1
Flew FLL to DCA and return with Jet Blue. Both flights arrived early clean aircraft friendly cabin crew and no charge for first bag plus a very reasonable ticket cost. I find Jet Blue provide good fares with good service you cannot beat that.,1
"Brilliant flight with Small Planet Airlines from Manchester to Faro on 18 August and return trip home on 25 August. The check in staff at the airport were great, the flights both left on time and we had a good flight. Cabin crew were friendly and helpful. Kids got a free inflatable airplane and they gave out sweets just before landing which were nice touches.",1
"Flynas lost my bag on a flight from Jeddah to Amman a month and a half ago. I've filed many complaints, sent many emails, made countless calls, and received promises to look into it and get back to me, but I haven't heard back and haven't got any answers in a month and a half. Really horrible customer service. Avoid this airline.",0
Useless. Cancelled flight to Brisbane put us on another 4 hours later then put down wrong gate on ticket and sent us miles away from the correct gate so we missed that flight went to Virgin desk and they gave us nothing. On way home flight got cancelled again shifted us to a flight 3 hours which for us was about as useless as Virgin Australia call center assistant. Finally asked if we could wait in the Virgin lounge so I could get some work done on what Virgin had made a useless day but all I got was a price to become a member of an airline which I won't ever fly with again.,0
"Very cheap airline, only suitable for local flights within Spain and with your backpack. If any connecting flights after that, you can forget about your luggage. Too complicated for them.",0
Jet Airways is even worse than the low cost Indian airlines. I flew from Delhi to Udaipur and back in September 2017 and the flights were delayed both ways. Today I'm flying to Bangkok and this airline is delayed again. I will not fly or recommend this airline to anyone. Food is also pathetic.,0
"My return journey was smooth and no problems, again the hotel for the stopover was good and I had a suite to myself went on the city tour. The flight crew on both legs of the journey were polite and attentive. The food was excellent and drinks plentiful.",1
I have done an online booking in thus first. After payment upon seat selection. It wouldn't allow me to select seat since all were Grey and not available. Only paid seat were available for selection. I proceeded thinking that on web check in I will be able allocated seats. Upon my surprise I was informed to web check in within 72 hours and 2 hours prior flight departure. When trying to select seat all are paid. Upon calling the airline they said that I have to pay else i won't be allowed to fly. I have paid rupees 7500 per person for one trip to Mumbai. I don't know who controls this. I have decided that I will never ever choose this flight.,0
"I would like to thank Lufthansa call centre staff for their support despite many difficulties and my abysmal German. Even though I booked a flight with an unsupported connection through agents website, when my flight was cancelled due to snow, they allowed for it to be rebooked and add additional journey leg to it without charging the price of a whole new ticket. Thank you. Flight itself was also managed very well with boarding and alighting procedures managed very well and passenger behaviour well controlled. I never eat, drink or use entertainment on flights, so I didn't rate this option.",1
Amsterdam to New York. Very pleasant experience. Thanks to Gardishja from the ground crew at Amsterdam Schiphol. Her help was crucial an very appreciated. Fantastic flight and smooth landings,1
Westjet consistently provides poor service. They oversell leaving passengers stranded. Their flights are often delayed because flight crew are over assigned. If the flight they are working inbound is delayed then the outbound flight is accordingly delayed. Happens all the time. I am a regular Delta long flight patron. Deltas relationship on domestic with Westjet has caused me to reassess that. I will redirect my long flight business away from Delta going forward. ,0
"Lisbon to Amsterdam. The plane was 1 hour late, I made a reservation in Space plus. Put my and luggage above my seat but very rude staff moved my hand luggage to another part of the plane. They were so incredibly rude I would not recommend or use this airline again.",0
Mallorca to Gatwick via Barcelona. Delay on the first 40 minutes flight. And on the second flight aircraft change by default in the fuselage of the airplane and new delay of 2 hours. Lack of information and assistance. Bad airline.,0
Flew from BKK to PNH It was a pleasant flight with a new aircraft and warm hospitality of cabin crews. Went beyond my expectation!,1
"Puerto Plata to Toronto. It's very difficult to express my disappoint with Air Transat. I attempted to contact the airline on the phone and waited nearly an hour and was told that I needed to be transfered to another dept. I waited another hour. When I spoke to a rep, I was then told that my inquiry for a veterans discount could only be done via an online form. I completed the form 3 times to be told that I did not meet the min timelines. I went ahead and paid for the Option Plus and when I boarded the aircraft I had to prove that I purchased it. They were unaware. To summarize, I have never experienced such poor customer service. I am currently on my second hour on hold while on vacation to confirm my seat.",0
"Mumbai to Stuttgart via Zurich. I wish to thank Swiss and its amazing cabin crew for taking such good care of me, when i had a syncope attack during my flight on 22 July from Mumbai to Zurich. Even though I do not know their names, i must thank the senior lady attendant for guiding and the younger lady for actually looking after. She didn't leave me for a minute, till I was better. I must congratulate Swiss air for maintaining such great standards.",1
"Yangon to Mandalay. Lounge photo and In flight meal photo are added. We can access Lounge at Yangon International Airport for all Business Class traveler, variety of Breakfast. Lounge is located at the 3rd floor of Yangon International Airport Terminal 3 for domestic. In flight meal is great but simple because it is just a 1 hour short flight.",1
"Absolutely horrendous environment. I had signed up for text message notifications and updates but it had not updated me that my flight had changed. By the time i figured out which gate I was suppose to be at, I was a few minutes too late. Customer service proceeded to tell me it was my fault even though their text message services were said to update me when flights change their terminals. No compensation, just another flight 17 hours later. Not to mention their planes are hot with a tiny ac fan that blows coldish air.",0
"London Heathrow to Atlantic with Virgin Atlantic. A very good flight, excellent crew, good food and a friendly banter at the bar with good barman. The lounge at Heathrow is the best I know. My only small gripe is that the Upper Class cabin on the A330 is a bit cramped compared to other planes but still my carrier of choice.",1
"Amsterdam to Mumbai. The food quality, cabin crew service and to add to this the baggage handling made it a mess for our journey. Jet Airways as always has been the worst experience for me and would never travel from now on with Jet airways. Raising complain with the team, they do not get back to you for 8 days and then they say we cannot refund money for damaged baggage as it is over 7 days. Kind of fooling customers, horrible customer service and least bothered staff.",0
The worst airlines I have flown in years! Kiosks were confusing and not enough help to use them. Both round trip flights from Boston to San Francisco were packed to the gills. Seats were terrible and cramped and it felt like you were sardines. Absolutely no snacks at all! Food offerings looked so bad even the staff said not to buy most of them. They have the audacity on the flight back to charge passengers for direct TV with no free channels at all! No cool circulating air so it felt suffocating! Seats terrible and uncomfortable. Staff agreed with our complaints. Flight was one hour late getting into Boston.,0
"Brussels Airlines cancelled my ticket and did not take responsibility. They said they could not do anything about it and that I would need to buy a new ticket. Yet they cancelled my ticket without asking me if I wanted the flight, having travelled a different way to Lisbon, they assumed I would not return so cancelled my ticket.",0
"Queenstown to Auckland. Our flight was cancelled due to weather. We were asking to get a refund for half the cost we paid the airline. They refused the refund since they said it was not their fault. It was not our fault as well. They told us to contact our travel insurance. Unfortunately we do not have it. Hope they can improve in this regard, be more fair. If a customer is unable to board the plane due to weather emergency, there should be a way to reimburse half the price.",0
"Booked flights for myself and family for March 18th. This airline is a complete and utter nightmare. Just got an email response to my request for a refund.  Email just apologised for delay and hoped my problem was resolved! No it is not resolved. That why I was contacting you! They have taken my money, cancelled the flights and not given me my money back. Good luck getting through on the phone. They know nothing and can do nothing.",0
"Sydney to Frankfurt via Shanghai with China Eastern Airlines was the worst flight and service I have ever encountered. Some of the flight attendants were arrogant and impolite. But the worst was the customer service in Shanghai. Most of the staff at the service counter for international flights can hardly speak any English. I had applied for a free transit hotel on their official website, but they never replied. So when asking about it in Shanghai they pretended that such offers did not even exist and I was forced to get a hotel at my own cost. Never again!",0
"Very good airline. Flying from Belgrade to Brussel via Munich, I must say that Lufthansa is very professional. Clean airplane, free drink and snack. The crew were very friendly and during the flight gave us all data about our flight. I recommend using this airline.",1
"Flew back to Bandung after a pleasant vacation in Bali. Aircraft with IFE although without sky interior. The hot meal was delicious, IFE content good although the touchscreen was not responsive. I hope could flew with Garuda again.",1
Very very poor customer service from British Airways. Myself and my partner were on a flight that was overbooked and so were accommodated on a different flight on the same day with a via point of Oman. While upset about the change of trip and the delay that would occur as a result we accepted that these things happen and were told to go straight to boarding for our flight to Oman. When we asked about tickets for the second flight we were given a form of ticket and told we would have to visit the transfer desk in Oman to get our boarding passes. On arriving in Oman they had no clue who we were and the flight we were meant to be on was full. We were left there for 4 hours with no communication from anyone in a transfer unit with no shop or vending machine and no offer of refreshments. After pleading with airport staff we were placed on a flight to Bahrain and transferred to our original planned destination New Delhi. We were approximately 12 hours delayed arriving and did not receive a single apology that day. To say it was a traumatising experience was an understatement.,0
They overbook planes and you may discover that your ticket means nothing and it is first come first serve service. They claim that I came late so boarding is closed  and they charged me new tickets. I had online boarding card for all my family but they refused to accept them.. Then after half an hour they came to me saying I have to make new booking and I have to call internationally to Etihad office to make the booking. I paid 23000 egyptian pound for new tickets and spend the whole night with my family waiting the next available flight after 12 hours.,0
"I had a flight cancelled during the pandemic and requested a refund and they gave me cash points instead. Now I have been informed they are no longer doing long haul flight. which now makes my cash points useless due to living in the US. Now they refuse to give refunds saying that I agreed when I was given the cash points I gave up the right to a refund. The fact is they turned my requested refund to cash points without my approval. Now I know why, they never intended for any of the US flights to be refunded based on what I am reading on other reviews.",0
"We are flying out of Rome to NY to connect to LAX. We were not told about a delay until we were already at the airport with our bag checked. The airline sent us to a far corner of the terminal to get information. There was nobody there. The next gate over we asked for help, they sent us all the way back to the help desk which we'd passed already. The ""help"" desk told us that the flight was delayed, they couldn't do anything about it and had no answers because, get this, the flight wasn't officially delayed yet. They said come back in 30 minutes to figure it out. We asked if there were options and they said no. Never once checked flight logs, never once looked to help. We come back, they tell us the flight is delayed 3 hours and now we're going to miss our connector flight. Is there anything we can do? They shrug. We asked for an upgrade. No. We asked for a row to ourselves as my wife is pregnant and they've greatly inconvenienced us. No help. No answers. Will we make a connector in NY? Do we need a hotel now? Who knows! Certainly not the two horrible women at the ""help"" desk who, instead of offering any sort of assistance, scolded me for not doing more for my pregnant wife. Absolutely horrific and atrocious. Not to mention, our inbound flight was delayed due to a strike nobody told us about either so they messed up both our flights with no warning. Use ANY company besides ITA.",0
"My husband and I flew ANA All Nippon Airways back from a trip to South East Asia. My husband was not feeling well, however they were able to move me at the back of the plane so he could lie down and I could lie down. Food was terrific with all varieties for every passenger's tastes. The cabin service was always professional and they served us with a smile. They even wrote a note to my husband on our bags  we hope you are feeling better"". This was not necessary but was very nice and well appreciated. I would highly recommend ANA All Nippon Airways.",1
I've flown Sunwing several times and it gets worse and worse each time. Going to Ft. Lauderdale we were delayed 6 hours. No refund or credit given. Now we are delayed going home over an hour wait so far. No apologies or explanation. Definitely will reconsider flying Sunwing again.,0
Flew back from Dublin on 8th October 2014 to Cambridge. First time I've used Cityjet and was really impressed. Excellent service very friendly and helpful stewardess. Fokker 50 was very pleasant to fly in. Arrived bang on time in Cambridge and was out the airport and in a taxi in 10 minutes brilliant.,1
"Mumbai to Goa. 2 hours delay. Check in process delay. We were standing at the gate not knowing when they would open the gate, even though it was after the planner check in time. They opened the gate after 30 mins of planned time. Air hostesses looked super tired and was serving a bad service. I will never take Spicejet again.",0
"What a fabulous airline, the plane was spotless and fresh and the crew were amazing! The service was second to none. Will definitely make them my first choice next time we fly.",1
The flights between Madrid and Manchester are arriving systematically with a significant delay. The arrival in Manchester which was scheduled before Eastern at 11pm was rescheduled to 11.30pm. Nevertheless the flight arrives at least one hour later most of the time. One time the flight arrived so late that the officers at the passport control were gone. The last time that I took that flight Mon. June 1st it arrived at 1am. These times really disrupt the life of anybody who has to work the next morning. There is no explanation given. My guess is that Ryanair has multiplied the number of flights but it is the same number of planes.,0
"Flew Qantas from Heathrow to Sydney via Dubai. I was apprehensive as I've heard a lot of mixed reviews about the staff. In my experience the staff were very polite and lovely on both legs. Plenty of food and snacks being served throughout the flight. Breakfast was ok, but I have never enjoyed breakfast on flights. Entertainment has a good selection with plenty to keep you entertained. Managed to get quite a bit of sleep and the crew even made sure I received my lunch after I woke up. Toilets kept clean and the seat was decent.",1
"Raleigh Durham to Detroit. Got to say that the service is horrible. I can't get over the fact that the flight was delayed twice leaving RDU. This is known by the airline yet zero effort is made to make connections. We made it to the gate with 10 minutes before take off. Plane at the gate and no agent around. That is the first issue. Why is no one at the gate? I have to track down an agent. They should have been waiting for at arrival. Next she speaks with the gate agent while he is closing the door. I am a customer service manager, this would not be at all acceptable in my industry. Worst ever. I feel as though the airline broke their contact and left me the passenger out in the cold.",0
"Singapore to Osaka. The worst airline I have come across so far. I travel a lot, but never encountered such poor customer service. They cancel flights and you have to run months after them for a refund.",0
"Dallas to Minneapolis. Thank you American Airlines I've been sitting at the airport since April 13th, it is now April 14th at 9pm. I'm still sitting here I missed my flight this morning and there's a storm in Minneapolis so I can't catch a flight until tomorrow morning April 15th at 8 in the morning I haven't eaten since yesterday. I've asked if I could get a voucher to stay at the hotel for the night and the voucher for meals but you guys have told me no.",0
"New York to Tel Aviv via Istanbul. Never again. While staff was excellent, plane was hot and extremely uncomfortable. Painfully uncomfortable. Several passengers requested for cabin air to be cooled. No avail. Plane was dirty. Get ready for your back and knees to hurt.",0
"Orlando to Boston. They'll charge you to change your flight, fine, but then they'll give you a flight they know you can't make. If you try to resolve online they will charge you again",0
"I purchased this ticket in September 2022 and chose my seat. I received email confirmation. The day before this flight, I received a notice that the airplane would be changed, but there was no mention of the need to get a new seat assignment. When I checked in via phone, I received confirmation of checking in, but no indication of the need to choose a seat. When I arrived at the airport, I was shocked to discover that I no longer had a seat on the plan. After a long conversation with a very unhelpful and unsympathetic agent, he assigned me to a window seat in the very back of the plane. The plane was dirty, smelly, and only one of the video screens in our row actually worked, which made even more people angry. My daughter and grandson were told they didn't have seats on the plane at all and had to wait until the whole plane was loaded to be placed in random seats, so our party could not sit together. I am exceptionally disappointed in how I was treated. I purchased a seat, but for some reason, my purchase was not honored.",0
"Horrible airline. Will not be flying with them again. I was supposed to fly a few days ago with Virgin Australia, but they delayed my flight 15 hours and did not provide a refund. Really unhappy with them.",0
"This is by far the worst airline ever. Not recommended. Even if their flights were for free. No sense of customer centricity. Upon bag drop off, more than two hours before departure time, they inform me that my flight had been delayed with 3 hours. This is completely unacceptable. I would like to know what recourse there is for this unprofessionalism.",0
"I fly American Airlines at least once a month, sometimes several. It has been very rare that the flight is on time with no issues. Often connecting flights are missed because of it. I've had to miss work and completely rearrange schedule countless times. Today my wife was delayed so many times on multiple flights that she could have drove from Texas to Illinois and arrived sooner. It's sad that the American Airlines doesn't take pride in their management nor seem to value their customers. We will be reconsidering our travel in the future and you should too.",0
"Macau to Da Nang with Jetstar Pacific. The checkin process is a mess. In Da Nang airport they only opened one counter for checkin. It took us almost 2 hours waiting for check in, which is totally insane. And the staff didn't understand English. I tried to ask her to call someone to open a new counter but she could only say two words ""please wait"". Worst airline.",0
"Scoot changed the aircraft at the last minute to a smaller one and offloaded a bunch of passengers including my family from a 9.30 am flight. So we were left high and dry after purchasing confirmed seats. We had to beg for seats on a later flight. They give us boarding passes for a 4pm flight, which was delayed by 2 hours, so we finally take off at 6pm! Also our baggage is handled so badly that my brand new suitcase came out on the luggage belt with black marks on it, looking like an old bag. Never want to use Scoot again! Horrible experience.",0
Flew from Gatwick to Sanford on the Dreamliner TOM 70 and TOM 71. Only positive things to say boarding prompt plane spotless on both legs. Regular updates from the pilot cabin crew friendly and attentive. Really impressed with the plane very quite and didn't seem to have any jet lag. The standard cabin for me was about the same standard as the premium on the 767 so was really happy with it and will be booking with Thomson next year.,1
Philadelphia to Dallas with Spirit Airlines. Terrible service when checking in. Paid for upgraded seats however they gave our seats away. No email was sent and etc. Poor seats and everything not worth it.,0
Auckland to Nadi. Fiji Airways service was excellent and the staff was attending to calls immediately. I would recommend flying with Fiji airways again. Keep it up Fiji Airways.,1
"Flew Pittsburgh to Fort Myers. The overwhelmingly negative reviews almost scared me off, but I spoke to several friends and family who have flown Spirit, so I gave it a try. First of all, I was well aware that most everything is an ""add on"", that's very clear from their website. The initial price quoted is their bare fare which is for the passenger and one personal item measuring no more than 14x18x8"" which is probably a backpack size. You can add any options or no options, your choice. Read the website. The plane was brand new, very clean and in excellent condition. The seats were comfortable, looked and felt like leather, but of course it was vinyl or something. The aisle was wider than most. The tray table was very small. All food and drinks are extra, so I brought my own on board. The plane departed early and arrived a few minutes early. Very good flight. We booked very last minute at a price that was several hundred dollars cheaper than any other airline. We will most definitely fly Spirit again whenever we can! Huge value for the money.",1
"A rather empty and quiet flight to Tel Aviv, very friendly cabin crew and due to the emptiness of the flight I had an entire row to myself which allowed me to work easily and have as much space as required. Unfortunately upon landing the breaks overheated and we had to wait for the fire crew to cool them down which delayed us. Otherwise an overall excellent flight on BA's part. This was the first time I have flown this flight and it has actually taken off at the correct time.",1
The customer service was fabulous. They put me on an earlier flight. They even transferred my luggage in a matter of moments. It was a wonderful trip.,1
"Flew Brussels to Hanover. Brussels Airline has very poor service and customer service. I would not recommend this airline to anyone. My flight was canceled, I was provided with the wrong informations and a refund was not paid although promised at the airport. The service at the airport was very chaotic and unorganized although this cancellation was very foreseeable. I would never travel with this airline again.",0
"Jakarta to Penang via Kuala Lumpur. A very bad experience flying with malindo, firstly during my connection flight we having delays more then 1 hours. It become worst when we arrived at Penang we found our baggage were missing. Until now from Malindo only email us that they cannot found our baggage.",0
I flew from Amsterdam to Copenhagen and back. Both flights were comfortable. Friendly crew members. Enough leg space. Clean aircraft.,1
I flew out of Hong Kong to Toronto. I tried to book my seat online as offered by the Air Canada website 24 hours before my flight but the system would not allow me to do so. I was sick with the flu and requested to get an aisle seat 5 hours before my flight at Hong Kong airport. I was then told that the airplane was overbooked and that no aisle seats were available. I was told to go to the Air Canada counter to request one. To my great surprise their is no Air Canada counter in Hong Kong airport. I was then told to go to my gate and ask the personnel there which I did and they offered an end of the plane seat without a working TV. This was unacceptable for a 14 hour flight. I was then told to keep my mouth shut and keep the seat that was originally assigned to me. I travel for a living and this kind of service I have never seen before not even from discount airlines like AirAsia or Cebu Pacific. Next time I will know better and save some money by booking with a discount airline from which I can get the same service or better.,0
"Glasgow to Toronto with Air Transat. The Attendant Call Button has to be pressed as water was streaming down from the air conditioning unit. I understand during landing it is not possible, however, on landing the call button was outrightly ignored. On disembarkation I asked if the Attendant would like to know why the Flight Button was called. Attendant held hand up to my face and said it was a leaking air conditioning unit. Back was turned on me. No follow up. I was soaked. No customer safety demonstrated.",0
Seattle to Minneapolis. An hour late from Minneapolis to Seattle. Over two hours late on the return flight. Very cramped and crowded in the plane. Bathrooms on plane were not adequate enough for the amount of people on board. Poor design and layout. Definitely not an airline I'd pick to do business with again. Waste of time and money. No pride in their business and lack of urgency.,0
"Mexico City to Salt Lake City. This is easily the worst airline experience I've ever had. I had a problem with my departure date and needed to switch it for another day, and not only did they not help me switch it but said it would be impossible to change my flight and refused to give me any kind of refund. I will never use this airline again.",0
"Flew from Oslo to London via Riga, my experiences with both flights were great, staff were friendly and spoke good English, as well as Russian, German and of course, Latvian. I recommend flying with this airline.",1
"Guangzhou to Tokyo Narita on 13th January. Good service attitude, clean and tidy cabin, good quality and low price.",1
Flew from Newcastle to Paris extremely large passenger took over most of my seat as flight was full no alternative but to endure. Baggage never reached connecting flight and was missing for five days which was half of my holiday. Never again will I fly with Air France.,0
"Erbil to Ankara. I have heard good things about Pegasus Airlines which is why I chose to go with them. One of the best things was that I could purchase additional luggage online. However, their website is absolutely terrible. I could not purchase anything ahead of time, despite the many many links listed to do so. I could not purchase my ticket through their website, but had to do via kayak.com. I may have heard good things, but the website alone is enough to make me never want to fly with them again.",0
"Absolute worst flight experience! The aircraft was so old and broken down. The seats were super uncomfortable. Most of the TVs did not work. The staff was extremely rude and did their job horribly. When I complained about the TV not working, they did nothing to help. The overhead lights and assistance buttons also did not work. When I asked for water, they told me to go to the back and get it myself. The bathrooms were disgusting. No toilet paper or hand sanitizer. Travellers were not even provided basic toiletries like toothbrushes and toothpaste even though it was a 16 hour flight. I will never be travelling on this airline again and do not recommend anyone else to either!",0
"Beijing to Brussels. Nice trip. The overall ride is very comfortable. Crew was very patient and asked carefully what meals were needed, and all the requirements were met in detail. They arrange the passengers very loosely, and there is not a short distance between them, which I think is very good.",1
I was scheduled on a flight from Abbotsford BC to Cagary AB. When we got to the Abbotsford airport we were informed that all planes had been grounded since last night. My flight was scheduled for 5 am and the next possible flight was at 6pm in the evening. I was going to lose one day of a weekend with my son. Westjet staff offered to get me on a flight leaving from Vancouver that morning and then arranging a taxi at their expense to get me to the Vancouver airport on time. I only lost 2 hrs of time. I am very impressed.,1
Rome to CMB. Generic lounge below par at Rome and boarding chaotic with no separate lane for premium passengers. Then things change. A very warm and gracious greeting at aircraft door and met at seat with more smiles. Jacket taken with no request and purser introduces himself with a chatty welcome to every passenger. Menu excellent and food well presented. Attentive and warm cabin crew with proactive service. Flat bed great but lacks a cover and duvet. Good amenity kit. Silver tea service the good old fashioned away. Flight on time. AVOD good but needs more film choice. Will be up there with SQ and CX if only they can improve boarding procedure give noise cancelling headphones and I think a more extensive wine list. For price paid an outstanding service and flight. Cannot wait to use again.,1
"Departure flight cancelled, moved back 1 day costing us additional hotel costs. And that was the nice part! On the return, flight delayed 8 hours! We take off, plane unsafe, return to Lisbon, chased down the runway by fire trucks. Sit up all night. Fly to Ponta Delgada early in the morning. No flights to Canada that day. Friday flight may or may not go on Sunday. Now there are passengers backed up as we found out Thursday was cancelled. And we are trapped in PDL. During this 3 days of hell, not only was there zero helpful communication from their staff when they did speak to us it was lies and abuse. I was shoved by one of their staff after we complained about waiting 1.5 hours to get our luggage back so we could go to the hotel. At least that was better than Friday, no hotel, no meals.",0
"It's the worst airline that I've experienced in my life. Do not book it.  Everything is so low class and very very poor service. From the staff at airport. They speak to you like you fly for free! Very rude. Almost everyone. On board the seat is very bad. They give you 2 croissant. I couldn't even move my legs. On the way back. I decided to upgrade to business class on board as they had 1 seat left. They called me from eco seat to business seat. I sat there for 15 mins they came to take payment. Said my card doesn't go through. Said not accepted debit card only credit card. I only have prepaid credit card. So I told them take my cash and take the rest from prepaid credit card since inside not enough what they want but I do have cash. Only lacking 400 qar and prepaid credit card has .. they said no, can't.  No Internet for me to contact my husband to refill the credit card. Not accept cash. Not accept debit card. They kicked me out to same eco seat I was so embarrassed No morals.",0
"Flew Frontier Airlines from Colorado Springs to Los Angeles. Our flight was at 9.35, they boarded us and then we were informed that the flight would be delayed for 30 mins due to bad weather and LAX was not allowing any planes to land. After 40 mins they announced that we would not be leaving until 4 pm due to zero visibility at LAX, we deplaned. The crew finally showed up at gone 4 pm. We got to CA after a 7 hour wait and it was sunny and good weather so in short the crew and the airline lied to us about the bad weather. This airline lies to their customers and charges for everything.",0
"Iloilo to General Santos. I booked this ticket last February and did not purchase any seat then. When I checked in online through the Cebu Pacific app, I was charged with a seat I supposedly purchased. I called and asked when I purchased it. It was the same time I checked in online. Now if I want to cancel it, I could. But I have to pay the same amount as spoilage fee! This is madness and unfair. I would like to say I will not fly Cebu Pacific again but this is the only airline operating this route. I feel robbed.",0
"London to Thiruvananthapuram return via Colombo.  All 4 flights were excellent. On time in clean, newish aircraft with professional, friendly crew. The flight from Colombo back to Heathrow must rate as one of the most comfortable economy flights I have experienced. The food was exceptional for economy and drinks were  plentiful.  I'm 1.93m and found my seat comfortable for the 11 hr flight with a decent choice of IFE. An excellent product which could teach other much larger airlines how to do it.",1
Ubon Ratchathani to Bangkok on B737 Service on ground and in air superb. Luggage a kilo or so ove but no problem. A bun sort of thing with sausage and water served in flight luggage waiting for me at Don Muang. I had more legroom on this plane than on my Thai flight on A330 from Australia. Recommend Nok Air to all.,1
"Toronto to Vancouver. This is the worst service I have ever had. I booked the flight time at 8pm almost 2 months ago but 7 days before I leave, Sunwing just sent me an email said they have changed my time from 8pm to 6am! That is totally unacceptable! I called them but they said this is the only time they have that day and they can do nothing to change my flight. They didn't even give me a reason why they change my flight time in such a early time! This is really disgusting and awful. I will never take this flight again.",0
I traveled from Boston to Houston on United Airlines in basic economy. I was originally routed through Chicago but when I found out my flight was waiting an aircraft I asked the customer desk to look into the matter. They changed my flight giving me a direct flight to Houston. The flight was uneventful and arrived 20 minutes before scheduled arrival time. I originally had three seats but the steward told me to vacant the third seat for a man who I suspect was a United employee. Overall a good flight.,1
"Flight was to depart at 9.15am and boarding to start at 8.45. I arrived at the gate at 8.50 to find no one at the counter. The boarding agent came back to the gate at 8.55 and told myself and another passenger we would not be permitted on the plane as the door was already closed. She cancelled my flight and put me down as a no show so that I could not get a refund. I have reached out to their ""guest relations"" numerous times with no response. This company is by far the worst. Save your money and pay a little more for a company that cares about their customers.",0
Ashville to Orlando. Horrible airline from all aspects of employees. Not one bit of customer service with this airline. This company needs a complete revamp all the way around. I wouldn't recommend to anyone.,0
"Although the lounge that Etihad uses in Manila is somewhat basic, the service on board the flight more than compensates. The aircraft flown was a 2 class 777 and my only complaint is that the seat is rather narrow for a substantial Westerner. The seat was however lie flat and was quite comfortable although storage space for small items is lacking. The service onboard was excellent. The cabin crew were attentive and helpful. The choices available for both food and drink were plentiful and catered to all tastes. The IFE system offered enough choice in film and music although other airlines certainly offer more. I would certainly fly with Etihad again.",1
"GA863 from Sorong to Jakarta on the early morning flight. Check in at Sorong was a little chaotic as there are only two queues and quite a few passengers checking in, however the flight took off on schedule. Onboard the cabin crew service was very good, they did offer me a meal, however I chose to go for a few snacks instead. Through out the flight the cabin crew kept coming around offering soft drinks and snacks. Arrival in Jakarta was only slightly behind schedule by a few minutes, however it took my baggage approx. 20 minutes to come out, which really is not bad for a busy time of the morning. Overall good service.",1
"Flew Scoot from Nanjing to Singapore. It is important that anyone planning to fly with Scoot, has to take note that you don't need to purchase premium seats because they can be changed without your knowledge. Assigned other premium seat as a result. Scoot uses its Condition of Carriage as an agreement that they can change your seat without prior notice. If you want premium seat, you can always do an upgrade onboard the aircraft. There have been many cases against Scoot and majority lost their fight, therefore their Condition of Carriage can be use as a mean to exploit customer expectation.",0
"Tel Aviv to Chicago via Rome. I had booked a flight and the cheapest was a combination of economy, premium economy, and business. Weeks before I get a bid to upgrade, and I do so from premium economy to business on the long hauls. I bid the lowest, and it gets accepted. 165 eur from premium economy to business. Not bad. It was worth it because the seat I had in premium economy was 8L which has bad legroom and I was glad I didn't sit there. It has the divide in front of you. Yes the food was not Emirates I am sure. But value for money it was spot on. I am tall so my feet would not fit all the way on the completely lie flat seat. But if you are just a bit shorter, it must be amazing and people were sleeping all through. I never flew business in my life. At the end I ask if I can keep the two teaspoons as a souvenir. Before disembarking the flight attendant taps on my shoulder and offers me a bag. ""Two teaspoons is not enough. With lots of affection to you"". There is a coffee cup set inside.",1
"This was the worst flying experience I have ever had. They changed my flight without notice, turning a 12 hour day into a 22 hour day of flying and sitting in airports. I could have forgiven that had their employees had one ounce of sympathy. Their cold uncaring response is what makes Delta the worst airline. One of them stated, well we have to talk to a lot of people, when I pointed out their awful customer service.",0
"We were attracted by the lower cost but we will never fly with Scoot again. We had premium economy seats that were comparable to economy seats in economy. The boarding was quite efficient but comfort, service and my food were of very poor quality. The cabin was not clean, we used tissue paper to clean table and armrests. A drink of water was offered in the first hour before a plastic covered menu was passed around, only two meals were available. No free water, no free snack was offered during the flight, an announcement informed passengers that they had received their free meals and would have to pay for any more food or drinks. Blankets were distributed upon request. Large, yellow, thin polyester squares that were not providing me any warmth.",0
"As a Mosaic customer with JetBlue the customer service is extraordinary. On my most recent flight, due to a family death, they could not be more accommodating and upgraded my seats with no additional charges and gave us a companion fare saving us some money. The seats are comfortable and the employees are customer friendly. Use their credit card and get Mosaic status",1
"Lion Air 8pm flight Bengkulu to Jakarta March 2. Flight 2.5 hours late leaving. No announcements had to ask for constantly changing information. No compensation when one customer complained and at last minute Padang food appeared with no implements to eat and way too late. Onboard they briefly apologized as flight late for ""operational reasons"". My understanding is this is a common occurrence for this flight. This airline has no customer care or communications capability.",0
"Guadalajara to Sacramento. I arrived at Guadalajara airport 3 hours before my departure flight at least that was what the airline requested all passegengers to do, the Service crew at Guadalajara airport had only one line for all international flights that included Portland, Oakland and Sacramento and some other flights so try to imagine how big this line was they had us waiting 2 .5 hours standing waiting in line to be checked in. They did not had enough personnel to accommodate all international flights in one single line, all passengers were really tired and upset to the point that one customer started confronting the ground crew and all passengers applauded this passenger for voicing their frustration so obiously we end up departing late from Guadalajara to Sacramento. Avoid using this airline at all cost.",0
Rome to Athens. I pre booked my seat. It was close to an emergency exit. However I did require a seat belt extender. Instead of the matter being dealt with discreetly the air hostess as loud as she could said she cannot allow me to sit there if I require an extender because it means I am not fit. No that's not the case. Regardless she then proceeded to as loudly as she could going to every person in rows behind me asking if they are alone and are willing to swop seats because I am too big to sit by the emergency exit. I have never been treated in such a disgraceful manner by an airline. To top it off I was skipped when food and drink was being offered. I will never travel this airline again.,0
"Melbourne to Amritsar via Kuala Lumpur. This is one of the worst airlines out there in terms of getting into contact with. They have no telephone service in countries outside India so it is impossible to get into contact with them when you need help. Their AVA service on their website is completely useless. For the low price, which is technically not because with all the add ons such as seat prices and bag prices  all add up to be normal prices of flights with other airlines.",0
"Frankfurt to London. The seats weren't that comfortable. That service was mediocre, and my baggage was delayed for more than 30 hours, and they claimed no responsibility. I am very disappointed!",0
"Stay away. I arrived 1.5 hours before my flight but they would not let me board, claiming I had to arrive 2 hours before hand for a domestic flight. Even though I had checked in the night before. They insisted I call their customer service, which of course was closed before 8am. I then asked to fly without my bags and they claimed I could not board in time, even without bags. Incredibly poor and at no point did they try to help.",0
"They cancelled both of my flights. O give them props for the first one they gave me enough notice to find a flight where i was going but they didn't give me a refund, tried sending me vouchers as a refund when i asked for my money back. When it came time to come home i got no notice, missed out on work, stuck with no rental cars. I would never fly with them again, and it made me value to pay more to get a flight that is reliable. They cant use weather when no other flight was cancelled or even delayed. My child is missing school due to this and its ridiculous cost me lots of money and i still havent gotten a refund.",0
"Phoenix to Minneapolis canceled as we were on our way to the airport today. The next flight out that Spirit offered was two and three days from today. Ridiculous! People have lives, jobs, kids, school, exams and animals to get back to. Spirit offered a lame refund and offered no funds for the extra cost of hotel to stay 3 more nights, or for the dog sitting or rearrange daycare and so forth. Never again will I fly Spirit. We are getting a ride to Las Vegas which is a 5 hour drive and leaves at midnight. Spirit does not care about any customer whatsoever. All the pilots should boycott Spirit and find other employment as well.",0
Flight WG063 from St. Petersburg Florida to Toronto on February 23. I arrived 2 hours before the departure time and I had purchased Elite pkg. There was no Elite service and the line up was extremely long. It took over an hour and a half to get to the counter to receive my boarding pass. It seemed very disorganized. Then the passengers were rushed through the security section ducking under the line barriers as the flight was being called. I have flown many times with Sunwing and I must say I was very disappointed with the service on this flight.,0
"Air Transat provides an unbelievably poor customer experience. My flight was delayed by 3hr in Gatwick resulting a missed connection and loss of baggage. Furthermore the check in staff at Gatwick were aware I would miss my flight and were unable to rebook my itinerary. Really poor customer experience. Furthermore following the loss of my baggage the airline handed my luggage to a really poor no name courier firm at Toronto who are seemingly unable to communicate. Again any other airline would use a reputable firm such as UPS, FedEx or DHL. Finally the A321 provides a really poor experience flying transatlantic. In total you are best spending your money on a full service airline such as British Airways or Lufthansa.",0
"Athens to Tokyo via Dubai with Emirates. The seats were pretty comfortable and with enough space between them even when one was leaning back. Cabin crew, lighting, entertainment, food, temperature were all excellent.",1
Atlanta to Minneapolis. They cancel and change more flights than any airline I have  been on. And then all they can offer is  excuses or reschedule you to a inconvenient time. They have absolutely no care for the customer. My stuff was changed 4 times in 24 hours due to grounding planes.,0
My flight was delayed which caused me to miss my connection in San Francisco to Baltimore. When I inquired about new arrangements I was told they would fly me to DC and it was up to me to get home from their. I asked if they would put me in a cab to get back to my car at BWI and was told no. United informed me that all the hotels were booked up. No apology. No remorse. No empathy. Then the plane I was taking to DC was delayed. ,0
"Rome to New York JFK with Alitalia. Did not know what to expect. Wanted more leg room for the 8 plus hour flight so went for Premium Economy. Liked the little free case of toiletries. Given wine, a pretty good meal, but before that corn chips and a drink. The second meal was not so great. Had good selection of movies but it was hard to get the screen up and the flight attendant had to help me. They just got new uniforms, very elegant and professional looking. The ground crew was helpful as the kiosk did not work. At the ticket desk the staff put my checked in bag up on the place where it was weighed. Never had that before. She was very friendly. She was proud of the new look of her uniform. Seem to like her job. I liked the screen in front of the seats where it told what altitude we were flying, kilometers and miles we flew and time still to go. My baggage was free. Bathrooms bigger than normal. Lots of space for my handheld bag. A very smooth ride.",1
"I very rarely leave reviews but after seeing all the awful ones for Allegiant I felt I should post about my good experience. I absolutely hate flying and am very picky about the airline, but my husband and I took a short flight from Provo, UT to Mesa, AZ on Allegiant and the experience was great. Planes were on time, no issues whatsoever, flight attendants were very kind, and they have such nice perks for military and dependents. Everything was better than expected. Thank you!",1
"Ras Al Khaima to Lahore. I have been frequent flyer of Air Arabia. It used to be a good airline. With passage of time, it service has gone extremely poor. First time in my 25 years of traveling I was called back from immigration and my lap top weight was included in the hand carry. It exceed few kilo. I was forced to remove my laptop. I left my bag in the car and travelled. The duty manager did not listen to my request. In fact a smile on his face showed how much non professional people this airline hires. It was worst traveling experience of my life.",0
Sitting at AEX. Flight 3271 was scheduled for 6.05am. It is currently 8.20am and still not boarded. There is always delays. I travel for business and American is so inconsistent it makes it hard for the business traveler.,0
"I went to my gate entrance for my domestic flight at 2.15 when my flight is at 2.50. At the time, when the officer scanned my boarding pass the machine said ""not checked in"" even thought I clearly had the boarding pass. The officer said to try again in 5 minutes and the same result kept coming up until 15 minutes had passed and now the result became ""too late to board"". The officer told me to go to the service counter and they kept sending me to different service counters until I reached the rudest lady who initially told me that I can't board within 20 minutes of take off, even though I was at the gate 35 minutes before take off. I kept begging her to help me but all she said was ""please step aside, sir. I'm busy"". That was 5 minutes prior to the supposed take off and of course I missed the flight. After all of this I had to go retrieve the bags I checked in and that took over 20 minutes, at which time I found out the flight had been delayed by 40 minutes. I have to wait for the delayed flight to depart before I can take back my checked in bags. What kind of customer service is this? Also I was informed that they may help me with rescheduling the flight if I pay the difference even though 1 AirAsia employee told me it was the system's fault.",0
"I fly from Bangkok to Copenhagen transit at Moscow then same route on my way back. On my way back to Thailand which is just 2 days ago on SU270 I was not impressed with the cabin crew at all. Their service was not helpful. While they were serving dinner I asked for something to drink the crew member just said ""one minute"". At that time I thought that they were busy serving food so I waited I ended up having to eat my whole meal without any drink! I myself would not fly with this airline again.",0
"What a nice experience with Garuda Indonesia from Jakarta to Denpasar. Nice cabin, Good food, very warm welcome from the cabin crew. I should say Garuda is still one of the best airlines in Indonesia also in the world. I can feel Indonesia warm hospitality on the plane! Can't wait to countinue my trip with Garuda Indonesia next time.",1
"Beijing to Seattle. I was really satisfied with this flight experience. Since there was some issues about the date for my F1 status so for the first time I could not enter the US, the staff in Hainan Airlines helped me call the US offices to make sure the exact date that I can enter the US, which is two days after. And then helped me change flight date immediately with low fares. Very thoughtful and effective.",1
"Hanoi to Singapore via Ho Chi Minh. This is my first time take Jetstar Pacific and it will be the last. Delay, change of schedule, poor customer service, looks very cheap but you will pay a charge for baggage while it is cabin size. Not recommended.",0
Hyderabad to Chennai. I had the worst experience flying with IndiGo airlines. The flight was delayed by 2 hours and adding to that handling of baggage was horrible. Baggage of 6 flights was released on a single belt at the same time. It took almost 1 hour to find the baggage and to find the baggage I had to make my way through 1000s of passengers waiting for their baggage. When contacted customer service they didn't have the contact info of IndiGo go personal in the airport.,0
"First time flying with Spirit because I thought the tickets were cheap. That is until they charge you all the additional fees. My flight out was delayed by 8 hours and am currently being delayed on my flight back with a minimum 2 hour delay so far. Customer service is hard to deal with, and with all the delays a minimal discount was offered on future flights within 2 months. Needless to say I will never fly Spirit again.",0
Delayed 4 hours each way from Philadelphia to California. No explanation whatsoever. They put me on a different flight and my luggage on the original flight and then lost my luggage! I would rather walk than take Southwest.,0
Traveled in July and Aug From Amsterdam to Arusha and back. I had heard KLM consistently had less than stellar reviews and they lived up to their reputation. Their food customer service and cabin quality paled in comparison to Delta who handled the second leg of the trip. If There was another option I would not travel KLM again but I expect that is why the get away with what they do.,0
We were denied boarding because we were one of the last ones to stand up. There was a long line of people waiting to board and the supervisor refused to let us board.  When we were on time and was a big line.  Do yourself a favor and don't use this airline.,0
"We were stranded on the Gold Coast hinterland following severe flooding that caused the road to be washed away. Despite Virgin having to cancel all their flights from Coolangatta for 24 hours and having a call centre close due to flooding, their customer service was excellent. Out situation weas changing from hour to hour, and Virgin changed our flights 3 times without any hassle, even though we had cheap tickets that were not flexible. Would recommend to anyone looking for a reliable domestic airline in Australia.",1
"Worst experience ever! Would never recommend Spirit, not to anyone for any reason! Terrible customer service! Uncomfortable seats! Reserved front row then told to move to second row after paying for front row because they have airbag on seatbelts on front row. Ridiculous! No mention of that when paying. Awful, never again will fly this supposedly cheap airline! Do yourself a favor and book with anyone other than Spirit.",0
"Abidjan to Lisbon. Flight was delayed by more than 3 hours, customer service was anything but kind and receptive to my complaint. Information about delay was given last minute. Personnel on board are alright but the organisation running TAP is clearly just trying to milk customers out of as much money as possible without providing the necessary ressources for a comfortable trip.",0
"After a delay out of Pittsburgh due to a ground stop and maintenance issue, we arrived late into Denver. Our Tucson flight was canceled. We attempted to get a later flight into Phoenix but the customer service agent on the phone refused to book us because the only seats were business class. After arguing for 20 minutes and asking for a supervisor the seats were gone. The agent indicated he could not issue a hotel voucher. I had to stand in line for 2 hours to get the voucher. United sent us to a filthy, seedy hotel with no shuttle service back to the airport the next day they were all booked. Now we are finally rebooked on a flight to Phoenix which is further delayed. We will have to rent a car and drive to Tucson.",0
"Minneapolis to Phoenix. I just wanted to give the Sun Country Airlines staff a 5 star review for their handling of my dog flying in cargo. They could not have been nicer every step of the way, for both outward and return flights. If you have any hesitation of taking your pet with you on a vacation, try Sun Country.",1
"Most horrible experience flying I have ever had. I have flown all over the world and I have never been angry about delays, flight cancellations because they happen and I'm a reasonable person who can deal if a curve ball is thrown. Allegiant air has no rhyme or reason for anything. They don't give you a straight answer. It took me 11 hours to get to Arizona from Ogden Utah. They first told us it was on behalf of the 3 inches of snow outside. This was untrue because had the plane been on time we would have missed the snow entirely. Then they stated that a plane was coming for us but was diverted to St. George to refuel. There is no allegiant hub in St. George. Then they told us that the plane from St. George was on it's way back but that is not the plane we will be taking anymore. Then they told us the plane we are taking had mechanical difficulties so we will continue to be delayed. The most frustrating part of this whole ordeal was that we couldn't get a straight answer from anyone. Allegiant refused to refund out flight as well as refused to offer any kind of voucher for our extreme inconvenience. They wouldn't let me talk to any supervisors on the customer service line and refused to give me any names of the customer service agents. This is not the first time I have flown with Allegiant and it is not the first time I have been given the run around story of why they can't keep a schedule. I will not fly this airline again. If you value you your job and need to be back at work when you say you will instead of stranded in another state do not fly with Allegiant. Cheaper fares? After they nickle and dime  you for everything from bringing your own purse, to charging you for a half a can of soda, you end up saving maybe 100 bucks. Not worth the 11 hours waiting and missing out on family time over thanksgiving. Thanks for nothing Allegiant.",0
"Abysmal customer service. Frontier Airlines canceled our flight from Orlando to San Francisco after delaying it over and over again and all attendants disappeared. No one tried to get us accommodation or a new flight. Many passengers ended up having to pay out of pocket for a new flight and the airline is still dodging sending out reimbursement forms. Unreliable, unprofessional, and frankly uncomfortable flights. Spend the extra fifty bucks on an airline that won't leave you stranded.",0
Booked morning flight from Adelaide to Melbourne waiting to check in and were informed flight had been cancelled no other flight available until later that evening. Later told mechanical fault as the cause for cancellation. Ended up having to pay more for a flight with Jetstar. Poor service and reliability.,0
"Really enjoyed this short flight from London to Paris CDG! The aircraft was looking new, flight departed on time, friendly cabin crews and nice Pain au Chocolat for breakfast was served for this 45 mins flight. Looking forward to fly with Air France in the future.",1
"Flew Ukraine International from Bergamo to Bangkok via Kiev. Poor Entertainment, rude staff and tight seats. I cannot eat fish, I've asked for chicken, but the hostess told me ""sorry just fish, You can try to exchange it with other passengers"" and then she left the fish meal on my table.",0
We flew to Rome from Newcastle via Heathrow the ground staff service was excellent at Heathrow as we needed disability assistance the day before we were due to fly home I received a text at 17.30 to say our flight had been cancelled but could not contact customer services for over 14 hours we were told we had been booked on an earlier flight which meant taking a taxi to the airport losing the money we had already paid for our previous transfer and the disability assistance service we receive in Heathrow was awful. We were left for 1 hour for someone to take us from the plane and then at the next station there was no one to take us to our flight connection so I had to push wheelchair myself.,0
Seattle to Dallas. Great flight and spacious cabin. Had a connection from Vancouver. Staff went above and beyond. First class meal was very delicious and the crew was extremely nice.,1
East Midlands to Heraklion with Thomson Airways. We were very impressed with the aircraft and staff on this flight. The plane was very clean and much better than previous flights with Thomson. The aircraft looked almost new and I am sure there was more legroom. The least said the better about the airport when we reached our destination.,1
"Baggage service misplaced our bags, no apologies just jokes. Took one and a half hours to rectify. Agent in Baggage services has no business being a supervisor anywhere. The customer service rep just sat and ignored me, terrible customer service.",0
I have booked twice with this airline and both times my flight was canceled. The first time was fine. They canceled both my flights and refunded me the money with in this week. This time they canceled my flight to Edmonton but rebooked my flight home with no notification. I only noticed because I was double checking my flight details. So I called them and waited hours for someone to contact me. Then was told I could get a refund but it takes up to 30 days to get it. Then when I asked why so long I was told that's just how long it takes. Not happy and will not try and book with them ever again. WestJet cost more but has way better customer service.,0
DCA to Jackson Hole Wyoming. Flights to Denver and one to Jackson Hole were on time. New clean Airbus 319s. Friendly and helpful crew. Return flight from Jackson Hole left about 40 minutes late due to weather but they held connecting flight in Denver and arrival in DCA only 10 minutes late. Excellent experience.,1
Having gained my seat allocation and boarding pass online my partner and I made our way to Brisbane airport. The flight we had booked was JQ487 leaving at 19.55pm. Arrived in plenty of time and heard the first call to get seats. Made our way to the gate where a rather nasty young blonde woman stopped us to say our bags were too big for hand luggage. She insisted we stop and measure my partners bag. Once we boarded every overhead luggage compartment had luggage identical to mine and my partners all the same size and shape. I do not appreciate the rudeness of the crew who are paid for customer service. The only thing that saved the flight was the apology made by the steward who gave good service. Your flight staff are great but ground crew a lot to be desired!,0
"The most uncaring, unhelpful airline that I have ever had the displeausure to travel on, left at least a hundred people stranded at an airport with no offer of hospitality or any other necessity including food or lodging. Furthermore instead of inviting us to join the sleeping travelers in a perfectly hospitable suite they decided to make up a flimsy excuse that we couldn't spend the night their because we would interrupt the slumbers of the first class, and they made their intentions clear that us, lowly ecomony traveler's were to spend the night on the airport floor, in light of their recent mistakes, not just to us but to multiple people, I would advise that any travelers would refrain from using United Airlines until they decide to actually start caring about their passangers.",0
"Pittsburgh to Honolulu via Denver. We were really disappointed in the service, or lack thereof, provided on our United Airlines flights to and from Hawaii. It is quite ridiculous that the only food available on an 8 hour flight is offered for a ridiculous fee. The cramped seats are also deplorable and the only solution seems to be to pay a fee to have a reasonable amount of space. I would rather pay more for a ticket and have reasonable accommodations than pay not much less for a trip that sucks. Unless I am in a situation that this is the only available airline for me, I will never fly United again.",0
"Would like thank Mr. Tony Nelson. He was extremely helpful getting our family checked under difficult circumstances. Tony demonstrated a level of professionalism that is very rare today. There was a problem, he took ownership of it and solved it. All through this event he was calm, professional and friendly.",1
"Las Vegas to Portland via Denver. Most incompetent airline ever! 3rd time flying Frontier, definitely the last, and they won't care in the slightest. They can't even have a flight crew ready to go. Both flights were delayed because of missing flight crew.",0
"I could not take my flight and asked for the taxes to be refunded. One told me this is non refundable, another one tells me their commission is higher than the taxes so no refund, and another one tells me if they ask for a refund, the airport will probably reject it. Seriously, at what point did I ask you your opinion!? Never again!",0
"Khartoum to Rome via Dubai. Very pleasant flying experience with Emirates. Seats were very comfortable and food was very good. The cabin crew very kind and attentive. On my way back to KRT, I had a long stopover in Dubai and Emirates provided accommodation very close to the airport. The transfer service to and from the hotel was efficient and fast and I was able to rest before continuing my journey to Khartoum. In addition, the fare was very cheap. I will fly with Emirates again.",1
"Copenhagen to London Gatwick. I flew with Norwegian on 4th of December from Copenhagen to London Gatwick. I never write reviews for airlines because as long as it takes me from point A to B safely I don't make a fuss but today's flight disgusted me. We had a delay of more than one hour and a half. Only after embarking all and siting in the plane for more than 30 min, everybody looking at the watch impatiently, they gave us a lame excuse. No wifi available though they advertise it big time and old aircraft. The ""icing on the cake"" though was the rude staff. Even if your customer service is not your forte at least in situations like this you can make an effort. I understand there are rules that need to be respected but there are nice ways of saying them, not snapping at people, raising the voice and patronise the passengers showing not only lack of customer service but also manners. Norwegian, please invest in training for customer service and send your staff from today's flight.",0
New York to Kunming via Guangzhou. A very pleasant flight. The seats were overall pretty decent and the food was not bad. The best part were the attentive and professional cabin crew. I had an issue with my screen and it was fixed immediately. Probably one of the best solo flights I have ever had. The airline has great people working for it.,1
Flight from Phnom Penh to Singapore on time on spotlessly clean aircraft with friendly and efficient staff.,1
"I encountered some difficulty with the seat that was assigned by the check in staff but the considerate and pragmatic Purser on that flight managed to solve my difficulty. Thus, I arrived at the destination feeling safer and with more comfort.",1
"In a covid world the cabin was disgusting, it does not look like things have been cleaned enough or to a good enough standard. As soon as we got to our seats there were marks and when opening the food tray it was absolutely disgusting with splash marks all over it.",0
Our trip from Boston to P.Delgada was ok except for the cramped seating and rude service from flight attendants. On the way back to Boston from P.Delgada was a nightmare for any parent travelling with a 5 yr old boy. They boarded us on time we took our seats and then waited and waited! Finally after an hour and no take off SATA informed us that we were waiting on 30 passengers that were still in Santa Maria. My son had started to become inpatient after about an hour and a half so I asked if we could go back into the airport with my child to stretch a little and the attendant told me no. They didn't even play a movie for us. After about 2 agonizing hours the 30 passengers arrived. Finally after boarding us 2.5 hours early the plane was finally ready to take of. Employees are unprofessional and disorganized.,0
"I had booked two seats on the front of the plane in economy. However, two rude customers refused to move from those seats. Even though they had been paid for and despite Turkish Airlines cabin crew failures to remove those passengers seating in our seats. Instead we had to sit at the back of the plane, whilst our seats stolen and occupied by others. Breakfast on Turkish Airlines is by far the worst.",0
"Karachi to Manchester via Doha, traveling with my 27 week pregnant wife and a 4 year old son from. My wife felt slightly unwell during the first flight, likely due to altitude and hypoxia however Qatar Airways was very helpful in getting her checked at the airport first by a paramedic and then in the airport clinic by the doctor. Later on they advised us to get further investigated and checked in a hospital, hence they arranged an ambulance, hospitalization, travel from hospital to hotel, arrangement of hotel and food vouchers on their own. It was really nice to have a feeling of being cared by the airline. Everyone was so humble and supportive. I could not have asked for a better service by the airline. Inflight was really good too. Nice comfy seats on Boeing 787 with good air pressure. I will recommend it completely. Thanks Qatar Airways.",1
Calgary to Toronto. The customer service repeatedly asked me to leave the Zone 3 line despite being a Zone 3 individual. When asked for reasoning why they were unable to provide a reason and became hostile in language. This combines with the fact that they are dropping there Aeroplan mileage program with the Star Alliance.,0
"Denpasar to Perth. I booked with this airline because of the time we would return home, depart 12.50 arrive 4.30. Our flight time was changed two days before our departure which meant our arrival time was 1.00 am the following day. Apart from this the food and service was appalling and I incurred a parking fee increase due to the change. I will never fly with this airline again and would not recommend it to anyone",0
"San Diego to Honolulu. We boarded the plane on Sunday August 18 2019. Everyone was very nice. Until we encounter a rude flight attendant. I called for her attention very politely. She, on the other hand, was annoyed by me even calling her over. My question was how many carbohydrates were in the complimentary breakfast. As a type 1 diabetic is very important for me to know. Well, she was extremely rude, no intention to even try to figure out how many carbs the breakfast had. Again the entire time she seem annoyed. But later we saw her being completely different with the family in front of us. She was nice, talkative and polite. I am extremely upset that the do not provide the nutritional facts for food which legally they should.",0
"Terrible Service. Very uncoordinated at the gates and mandatory masks on board, but it was not enforced. Had to spend money on masks at the airport after being denied boarding because of no mask.",0
Flew United Airlines from Sacramento to Boston. The seats on the plane were unbelievably small and the airline changed our itinerary and moved our group of four all apart from each other and all in middle seats even though we had selected better seating when we booked the flight four months earlier. The customer service on the phone when we called to change the seating back was rude and very unhelpful. The staff at the check in desk were able to help us on one of the flights and we were able to at least not all have middle seating. Even with a window or aisle the seats are the most uncomfortable with zero leg room.,0
The worst airline I have booked a flight with. They didn't inform anyone the flight was cancelled. A 3 hour wait in line just to speak with a representative and ultimately we found out they were on strike. Yet they issued boarding passes. Avoid this airline or it will cost you as it did me. Booking another flight at the last minute is never cheap.,0
"Frankfurt to Bucharest. It was my first experience with this company. And it was one of my worst experience dealing with it. The flight got delayed 2 hours, the team is impolite not well mannered and not welcoming. Not helpful at all. The lady standing at the check in was very rude and Impolite. I would not recommend this company nor choose it once again.",0
I was on flight SN3244 Kos to Brussels where a passenger refused to put on his mask properly before take off. They kept him on the flight and during the flight he even took it off completely without the personnel doing anything about this.,0
"Makassar to Jakarta. When I arrived 2r before flight departure which was initially schedule at 2000, the flight was announce with 1hr delay. I request to change to an earlier flight and the staff told me that there was no earlier flight. After 3 hours waiting, flight GA619 is announced to departure, then some of passengers change from GA613 to GA619 at the gate. I tried to request as well but the staff didnt consider us. Now I am waiting with no more explanation from the staff, no care and no consideration of the customer.",0
"I'm speechless. This flight was supposed to be 2 stops, and 23 hour flight. It is now 3 stops, 3 delays and 60 hours so far and I'm still sitting waiting. And all the weather is good. I though to give them a second chance since they fail me before, I was stupid. You had been warned. No more United Airlines.",0
Bangkok to Chicago via Tokyo. Won't be flying them again. Arrived at the airport at 6 for my international 8am flight which was delayed. At noon they cancelled the flight. They have 1 person helping customers getting on new flights. Most people are stuck here an additional 24 hours. Absolutely terrible customer service. There are about 30 furious people here still waiting for hours to get on flights. The best they are offering is getting in 24 hours late.,0
Great customer service from JetBlue team in Salt Lake City. Traveled with special needs child and everyone was very helpful. Very easy getting on plane and not stressful. Also traveled with 5 year old son and he enjoyed it as well.,1
"Brisbane to Perth. I wish to complain about the service I received while attempting to board our flight Christmas Day 2019.  We accepted the offer from ground staff to board early only to be stopped at the aircraft door by an extremely rude member of staff.  I was forced to sit on the plane door edge to catch my breath.  The staff member still refused to acknowledge the seriousness of the situation. Only after the intervention of one ground staff did she appear to care as she was caught out being so nasty. At this point she pretended she had no idea I was ill. For a company that portrays itself as caring and customer focused, this was very poor.  Leg room in row 27 was appalling. I'm only 160cm tall and I was cramped. My partner is average height and his knees had to go either side of the chair in front.  An awful experience and I'm dreading flying home.",0
British Airways are not interested in providing normal business class comforts and cuisine or even lounges on some routes. The Cancun route and the Nassau routes I have flown recently show this clearly as they are presumably are not bothered with little or no competition at all. This saddens me that they have made a clear decision that on holiday type routes they will provide the absolute minimum on everything. One example that shows how pathetic it has become with cutbacks out of many problems I encountered on these routes is that the food was so awful on the Cancun flight recently that we merely asked for cheese and biscuits in business class to be told that we could only have one packet of two biscuits each as BA only allocated one packet per person. The staff all agree that this was pathetic! No lounges at both these airports either and queuing of business class and economy all together no attempt to really show you paid extra for your ticket.,0
"Chennai to Hyderabad and Hyderabad to Bangalore in February. Very pleased with this airline, clean aircraft, on time service, no luggage issues. I booked this trip from the US and everything worked out without any issues. Excellent value for money and way better than full service airlines I have flown within India.",1
"I bought and paid flex ticket Zurich to Corfu for late April, they cancelled the flight, no reimbursement, you have to phone to Athens but you never get through! No possibility by email, chat or online. They write that there are long waiting times for telephone connection but they don't solve this problem.",0
"Vancouver to Newark. Extremely comfortable seat, very good for both reclining and sleeping. Excellent service from the friendly cabin staff. Outstanding range of refreshments. Air Canada business lounge in Vancouver unhurried, relaxed and very comfortable. Would fly Air Canada any time!",1
Entebbe to Johannesburg via Nairobi. The crew was very hospitable and polite. Good time management as well. However the crew responsible for announcements should stop eating the words and try to be more audible.,1
"Milan to Belgrade. I flew with Air Serbia many times and never have any problems. Now they selling food druring the flight just like most of the airlines. The airplane was nice and clean, the crew always friendly and the departure was on time and arrival also. We have a great sunny day to fly so everything went perfect.",1
"Kuwait to Istanbul. The best experience, it was in time and the trip progressed smoothly. They have the best leg room, the food serivce was abundant. The crew were helpful and accommodating to passenger requests.",1
I flew from Chicago O'Hare to Dublin and from Dublin to Amsterdam and Amsterdam back to Dublin and Dublin back to O'Hare and I must say I was pleased with the airline. The food was good the entertainment was good and the leg room on the flights was great. Only issue I did have was from Amsterdam to Dublin because we arrived 30 minutes left and nearly missed our connecting flight from Dublin to O'Hare however we made it on time with all of our belongings. Will definitely use Aer Lingus again on any future trips to Ireland.,1
"If I could give negative numbers I would. We attempted 3 times to check in online without success. Once we arrived to the airport and checked in there we were charged an extra 30 euro service fee for not checking in online. They did not seem to care that we had tried multiple times online with no success. Checking our bags was also more expensive because we paid at the airport instead of doing it online prior to arrival. By the time they were done with all of the extra fees, the total for the extra fees was close to what we had paid for our original ticket. They had our passports as we had given them to the agent in order to check us in, and we were told we could have them back once we paid the fees. I felt as if our passports were being held for ransom! To add to our experience the gate was changed without any notice or announcements. The only reason we found out about the gate change was because I approached the gate agent of the initial gate about why we had not started boarding and our flight was due to leave in 10 minutes. That was when she informed that our flight had changed gates and we should go there. Then our flight was delayed, thankfully for only 45 minutes or we would have missed our next connection. Overall it was one of the worst experiences I've had with any airline, and I will never fly them again.",0
"Kathmandu to Melbourne via Kuala Lumpur. Horrible service by staff who were rude right until we landed. Meals were only warm, entertainment was very slow to load. Overpriced and would not fly again",0
"Flew Eurowings from London to Phuket via Cologne. Booked them as their flight times were really reasonable and the price was good. Flying from London to Phuket the flight was delayed and we were told it was due to weather conditions, which is funny as from all flights at the airport their one was the only one delayed. From Cologne to Phuket all you get for 13 hours is a small bottle of water. There is food available to buy but they ran out of most items half way through the flight. They sold people headphones but it turned out their system was down, so there were no movies or anything. Flying from Phuket to London via Cologne there were supposed to be 3 hours between the connection in Cologne for London but they changed the time of the flight allowing for just 1, which would have been fine if they didn't fly out of Phuket an hour late for some reason. At Cologne the staff were rude and we were rushed and made to run, like it was our fault their flights are always late. We arrived in London to find out that they have left our luggage in Germany, so now we are waiting to get it maybe at some point.",0
We flew from London to Melbourne return. We got a great deal in business class and the flights were above expectations. Used the Etihad lounge at Heathrow the United lounge at Melbourne and had lounge access during the short stop in Dubai. No alcohol is served onboard the plane but we didn't really miss this and all the of meals were very good. Cabin crew were very good and professional. We had 15 hours in Brunei on the return leg and were given a room at the Radison hotel for about 11 hours. All flights were on Boeing 777. We would happily use them again.,1
I flew from Manchester Airport and was flying to Newark then had a connection flight to Rochester. As soon as I checked in I was told they had overbooked and asked us to fly to London first. I explained that we had a connection flight to Rochester and we were attending my nephews wedding so couldn't have any delays. We were then told there was no seats on the Rochester flight. After a lot of arguing they got us on the 1st flight to Newark and then found us flights on the Rochester flight but the 4 of us would not be seated together. I had 2 children with us and was not happy but just pleased to get the flights. Coming home we were delayed 3 times from Rochester. Our connection flight from Newark was boarding at 6.30pm we got off our flight from Rochester at 7.05pm and had to run for 10 minutes to catch the flight my daughter has asthma and struggled however we just made the flight. I wouldn't book with United again as they did not make either of my journeys relaxed and enjoyable.,0
"Luton to Belfast for New Year. While landing at Belfast, winds made for a difficult landing and we diverted to Dublin. The staff kept us updated and we were told we would fly back to Belfast and try to land again and if we couldn't would fly back to Luton to change crew. We had the option to get off and make our own way to Belfast and approx 120 people made this decision, we decided to stay onboard and made it to Belfast before passengers who had made their own way. Crew were professional and friendly.",1
"Had some sampling time limit issues with my nucleic report, staff helped me with hospitality and contacted the Myanmar staff several times to make sure I will have a smooth inbound experience in Myanmar. thanks a lot.",1
"London to Cebu via Hong Kong. Very slow response, they don't care about the passenger's welfare. They never bother to rebook the cancelled flight because of the corona virus outbreak. They are policy oriented people. They cannot help you at the moment you need them as Cathay Pacific is also a terrible company.  No hotel or any accommodation being provided. I was stuck in the Airport in Cebu for the whole night as there was no help at all. I requested for them to rebook my flight but they refused. I even asked Cathay Pacific to help me but they refused as well. The communication and their customer service is a struggle. It's very hard to contact them with regards to my cancelled flight. No advice or any notification from them.  I am really annoyed with the way they handled the situation. They are just after for the money as they told me to book for another flight and it's very expensive as they cannot rebook me. Terrible company. If I can only rate this company to 0 I would do so.",0
"Separating families that booked together. how about you get back to providing decent service heck even logical approaches to possible issues! I booked a first class flight two months ago for my sister and I, preselected seats and now upon checkin found out my original selection was changed and you separated us to sit next to two strangers? In what world does that make sense to separate travelers who booked together when you have 3 open seats just in different rows, and your customer support line wasn't of any help either. Saying, ""they don't have the power to move anyone"", but your company or system had the power to separate two travelers who booked in advance? Only advice given was to talk to the desk agent. So now I'll need to arrive earlier than planned to try to sort this out. Absolute worst customer support I've seen for something that should have never happened!!",0
"Los Angeles to Stockholm, and Norwegian has one of the poorest excuses for customer support. There were 3 of us checked in at LAX with luggage, unfortunately my luggage was not delivered. After reporting the missing luggage in Stockholm, the nightmare started. They finally found the luggage and started shipping it around, unfortunately not to the city of our travel. After seven days of misses they finally got it right in Berlin which required several emails and international phone calls. We followed the guidelines to submit for expenses. I had to contact them after several months to remind them of the claim which they ignored. They sent back an offer of less than one third the claim. I send back a request and it went in to their ignore bucket. ",0
"Frankfurt to Kuala Lumpur via Doha with Qatar Airways. The flight was great. Flight attendants were attentive and nice. I like how they turn off the common display screen during night hours, unlike Emirates. Food was also great. Green Thai curry chicken was surprisingly spicy, which I like but I'm not too sure if it's suited for normal people. Overall good experience.",1
"Dirty old aircraft, extremely uncomfortable despite having an entire row to myself due to the seat design. Cabin crew friendly enough but did nothing to enforce covid regulations. I was seated opposite a customer with her unmasked nose on display and it remained like that for the rest of the flight. She wasn't the only one and cabin crew said nothing to anyone. They spent most of the flight hiding behind a curtain. The aircraft was also disgustingly dirty and had obviously been in this state for some time. Transavia also refuse to take cash which means you need to have a card they accept to buy any of their low quality, overpriced refreshments. They also made some weird announcement about people not being able to take pictures or video onboard. Obviously an attempt to cover up their lack of cleanliness and safety.",0
Manila to San Francisco via Taipei. This is the second time I have flown EVA Air from the US to Manila and back. As a disabled passenger I found the airline to be extremely caring in their handling of my needs from checkin to deplane. The flight crew were all very helpful in my care during the flight and the aircraft was clean quiet and on time.,1
"London to Phoenix, BA289 yesterday. The plane was supposed to land at 1835. However, it landed at 1940. Because of this I missed my connecting flight to Ontario, California aboard American Airlines. By the time I was able to go through custom and pick up my luggage, it was already 2030. The flight departs at 2037. I went to the ground crew of American Airlines, they told me that I will not be able to make it to my connecting flight as they are already on the runway. They then directed me to British Airways. I went to the ground attendant of British Airways and she told me to go back to American Airlines to get it re booked. I went back to American Airlines then they told me again to back to British Airways since they are they the one who caused the delay. I went back to British Airways with the American Airlines supervisor. The British Airways attendant gave me a card with the customer service number and told me to call them in the morning. She did not offer any explanations or anything. American Airlines said we can re booked it for tomorrow morning but they did not offer any accommodation. I ended up getting my own car rental and drove from Phoenix to California in the middle of the night since I was not able to resolve this issues with both airlines.",0
"Unbelievable that they cancel days before flight. You can't change anything online, it all has to be done through Allegiant. I have spent hours and hours on the phone and still haven't talked to anyone.",0
"This was my worst flight experience so far. I was charged 40 euros for check in at the airport. Online check ins were unavailable every time I tried to online check in. Obviously there were a lot more people around me having the same issue. If you ask me that's unacceptable. 1 hour and 30 minute delay of the flight. The plane in bad condition. Old. Staff were nice. I am not going to consider flying with Wizz again, nor recommend it.",0
Kuala Lumpur to Kota Kinabalu. The positive point is only punctual operation. I was disappointed with the business class product. I don't understand the concept of using old 738 with no IFE. What do you expect passengers will do with no IFE on a 2.5 hr flight. The seat was fairly uncomfortable. The biggest let down was the food the food served in business class was awful. Stewardess courteous but not attentive nor particular warm and friendly.,0
Sure get a cheap flight but you'll get to spend hours and hours at the airport waiting to get on your flight. I am in the middle of 3 hour delay that has been upgraded to a 6 hour delay. I could have spent this time on something productive instead of sitting in an airport. My mother's last trip involving Spirit included a 2 hour delay and on my last flight with spirit it was a 3 hour delay. Change your name to Delay Airlines.,0
Rome to Moscow. The only good thing is the food and the flights leave on time. Nobody smiles at me. No TV or radio on this short flight. They provided Russian newspaper.  They lost our luggage. and it's our 2nd day without our bags.,0
I remembered why I don't use these idiots to fly. They can't keep flights on schedule to save their lives and when you travel with a handicapped person schedules are very important. I will never fly them idiots again.,0
"Indianapolis to Minneapolis. I am in a wheelchair, needing much support. Staff at the check in desk was amazing. Due to mechanical error, the flight was delayed 5 hrs. She kept coming back onto the plane, even though I know she must have a lobby full of angry other passengers. This was professionalism at it's best. Those of us who need that extra little help truly appreciate that 'extra mile' being taken. This lady is a treasure and you should take good care of her.",1
Flew from London to Brindisi via Milan on 4 March 2013. The staff at Heathrow were very good. The flights were good and the inflight service was attentive.,1
Flight from Toronto to Rome and then connecting from Rome to Milan. Our flight was late leaving Toronto by 45 minutes actually 1 hour by the time we left the runway. During the flight the crew were inattentive and somewhat rude. They appeared only when serving drinks and meals and disappeared during the remainder of the flight. Passengers had to go and get their own drinks after service was completed. Lots of spills as passengers walked from the back of the plane with their drinks. The continental breakfast was pathetic offering 2 Oreo cookies along with yoghurt and a soggy pastry inside a cellophane wrapper. When we landed there was no fast tracking provided for us at the passport control and we had only half an hour to get through before our connecting flight. It was no surprise that we missed the connection as it was in the other terminal. We were issued another boarding pass and had to wait another 2 hours for the next flight. That flight too was late leaving. We will never fly Alitalia again. Service is unreliable flight crew are indifferent and the washroom facilities during the flight are deplorable.,0
"Kuala Lumpur to Toronto via Taipei. I am an EVA Air convert. Seating is comfortable and the service is great. There was a stop overnight stay in Taipei and we were looked after as soon as we arrived. They quickly took us to the airport hotel. As it was a stop for about 24 hours, a day tour was offered but we took the bus to Taipei to see the famous 101 building. Savoured the local delights and bused back to the airport. The airport hotel has good selection for breakfast. Overall it was a great experience and we would definitely fly EVA when we next travel to the east.",1
"Vancouver to Winnipeg. Bad customer service. They keep delaying our flight, they gave us less then 24 hrs notice this is not acceptable. Flights are cheap but never gonna fly with them again. I tried to call them many times but they never pick up the phone they put me on hold for 1 hr but I never hear any voice.",0
"A recent flight on Air New Zealand's night time service to Singapore left me thinking this airline is more and more becoming a lost cost airline than an actual low cost airline. Arrived early at the airport to be greeted by one very helpful person who referred me onto service agents. The first lady was ignorant and could not care less about acknoeledging those waiting while helping others. Then went to somone else even more useless who informed me no I cannot check luggage through as they don't code share with the carrier I was due to travel from Singapore to Hanoi which was ridiculous considering both Air NZ and that airline share the same terminal in Singapore and also the same transer counters. Checking in these days on multiple flights on seperate tickets is possible all over the world, obviously not at Air New Zealand. Much more assistance provided by Changi airport staff than by Air New Zealand. The aircraft a fairly new 787 was tight in economy due to squeezing in as many seats as possible including its overvalued sky couch. Food and beverage way below par compared to other four star airlines. No bread roll,jam and butter for breakfast and scrambled eggs run out after 9th row of economy with the rest getting some tasteless noodles with not much though having gone into their menu where most passengers are european. Avoid this Airline if you can at all costs",0
Flew from London Gatwick 15th June to Sanford Florida and return trip 29th June. Both times we left on time and arrived ahead of schedule. Staff on both flights were pleasant and courteous. We were 2 adults and 2 children sitting in general cattle class seating although not entirely luxurious was tolerable but wish the TVs were a bit bigger so we could have watched the films didn't bother hiring earphones as viewing was just about impossible. Wouldn't hesitate to fly with Monarch again.,1
"We had booked to fly in 2020 but had to cancel because of covid. We were given credits for 2 different flights. When I tried using these credits the problems started. Dealing with Ethiopian Reservations is a stressful exercise. Ringing is totally stressful. An agent answers and then I would start my explanation and they would cut me off. Emailing is slightly better but I would have to send the same information several times before I got anyone to do anything. Finally I booked our flights. Two weeks before we were due to fly they canceled one of the bookings and said we would have to change the dates. After much stress with emails and calls I finally sorted it out. We were told we could use our excess credit for an upgrade. But, when we tried to do this they refused. The flights were OK. Staff not so helpful or friendly. The food was disgusting and the mains were inedible.",0
"Despite some reviews on this site and others my experience with Air Transat was very pleasant. Yes the seats are a bit crowded together but that's par for the course on almost every airline these days. Food was better that expected it was quite good. In flight entertainment had a decent variety of current movies and TV shows to suite all ages and tastes. Quick check in, pleasant staff especially the flight attendants the service was very good. Would recommend Air Transat.",1
"I got email on 5th March that the schedule of my flight to Italy in April was changed with suggestion of rebooking or cancel of flight. Even though it didn't mention about the deadline of cancel order, a week later, the link was already expired. Strange thing is there is nothing to say about my flight status change in my account page now. I've wanted to cancel the flight but it's impossible to cancel from website and also unable to make a phone call since call center is overloaded. From government order of my country due to corona virus, citizens can't go abroad from now on and my flight also should be canceled but there is no notification from Wizz Air yet. I understand that wizzair has no ability to handle corona virus impact but at least, they should allow customers to cancel the flight from website without cancel fee immediately, not trying to rip off to charge expensive call fee from customers to cancel flight in this emergency situation.",0
Excellent flight with jetblue Mint business class. Our bags were taken to get checked in by a lovely jetblue mint team member. We got expedited security clearance too. We boarded on time and got seated. Our flight attendants came round and introduced themselves and asked if this was our first time flying mint. Our amenity kits and a little note were left on the seat. They came round with noise cancelling headphones for everyone. They asked if we would like a drink and myself and my husband chose the refresh mint cocktail. They came round and cleared cups before we took off. Bottles of water provided at every seat in advance. Seat was super comfortable I loved the fact the offer directTV entertainment this was great. The inflight wifi worked perfect and I could stream facebook live. The food again was lovely we ordered the plane eats menu and everything was tasty. The only slight gripe was that the croutons on the salad were soggy. But that's all I could say. Excellent selection of alcoholic drinks. Ice cream for pudding and I chose a lovely freshly brewed coffee. A decent choice of wines with our meal. I settled down as we flew at night and got around 3 hours sleep. It was lovely. The duvet pillow and seat were all comfortable. Cabin and toilets all clean. They left us a milkbar cookie to take home. I would definitely fly jetblue mint again.,1
"It was really brilliant to fly on Boeing 787. It has WiFi, food delicious but spicy. Crew are kind and friendly with my family. I will again fly on Biman Bangladesh",1
Zurich to Bangkok with Swiss. It was one of my best flights. Very friendly staff who were very attentive. Good food. A little bit a old plane but clean and a confortable seat. Its very good that Swiss are getting new Boeing 777 planes. We landed up even 20 minutes early. It was a very good flight without problems.,1
Absolutely useless airline. Cancelled tickets without notification due to aircraft maintenance. No refunds to speak of and promised to refund airfares but the refund has been postponed indefinitely. Lost money on this due to accommodation deposits lost. Do not ever use this airline! Use reputable airlines.,0
"London to Ho Chi Min City via Hong Kong. Terrible experience. The flight from London was delayed due to unexplained reason. They refused us on the second flight from Hong Kong to Ho Chi Min City even we had more than an hour for the connection. The next available flight was in 8 hours, we did not receive enough not even to buy a decent meal and a bottle of water in Hong Kong airport. Members of staff incredibly rude. We spent 3 days of our precious holiday in a terrible state because of the jet lag and the lack of sleep. They did not offer access to the lounge. Never again with Cathay Pacific.",0
"Just to print the boarding pass was a nightmare. I tried for several times and I did not succeed. That was in Rome. I asked a friend in UK and we did not succeed. We made a round of all the shops in town that could help us, but they could not, we went back and tried many ways, at last after many many attempts we had this boarding press printed. A real nightmare and a loss of time. Moreover to bring the guitar in the cabin I had to pay 50 euros. I really would not recomend it.",0
"Gatwick to Mykonos. The easyjet flight was delayed according to the app and the check in boarding signs. I made my way to the departure gate 51 to enquire about the precise timing of boarding and to confirm the flight was indeed delayed. I was standing in the speedy boarding queue and when my opportunity came to enquire about the delayed departure the check in staff replied she knew nothing about the delay. She was intentionally obstructive and unhelpful. I explained my wife was busy buying something we has not packed for our trip. The easyjet staff member could have offered to put out a PA address to call my wife but no, she was never going to be that helpful. Instead she rather just ran off a standard speech that the flight is not delayed and that I needed to go and find my wife. Once we had checked into the boarding area there were all sorts of pa announcements calling for late passengers. After this a PA announcement came stating the pilot was delayed in arriving so the flight was indeed delayed. I would like to give Easyjet a big fat zero for this customer service.",0
"Cheap airline, will never use them again. Started weighing carry on baggage at the time it was time to board airplane. It leaves you no time and no option to take anything out of carry on bag, if it has overweight, because simply you have no place to leave your belongings. So you have no other choice than just pay 60 eur ,and check in your carry on bag. Usually other airlines check your carry on bag at the time you get tickets, so you can take anything out if you need to and put it into your check in luggage, but this airline does it at the boarding time, so they could make that extra 60 eur from you. There plenty of good airlines around, so stay away from airBaltic, if you have an option.",0
"Worst experience I've ever had in an airport, poor organisation with bad customer service from British Airways staff who didn't care that I would have a 5 hour delay, due to been told I would need to cancel and rebook my conecting internal flight. As my flight was delayed between JFK and Heathrow. I was appalled to see how badly immigration was dealt with and how little effort British Airways put into organising its customers. Some people where told to go to a service desk and cancel and rebook flights, while others got put in a fast track immigration queue. No staff seemed to care about the delay my partner and I were experiencing after a 7 hour flight. I would never recommend British Airways to anyone. They only care about premium paying passengers and the service they claim to offer has been left behind by other providers. Absolute garbage!!",0
New York to Albania via Rome. I reserved my flight a month ago and asked about the cancellation policy. I was charged extra so if I needed to I could cancel. 2 days before the flight I has a family pass away and could not make the flight. I called the company and I was encountered by the most heartless woman. She refused to help and hung up on me when I asked for the call to be escalated. I wish I would of never booked with them.,0
Paris to Marrakech. The plane arrived 4 hours late and we had no communication at all. Then we finally boarded but we waited a lot and could not take off because a passenger fell while onboarding. He got injured but the crew let us in. Doctors came and asked him to leave the plane but the passenger refused to leave. We eventually took off. The crew during the flight was the most impolite I have seen. I did not feel good and asked for water. The woman said she would bring some but never came back.  We arrived 5 hours late.  Awful experience. Won't recommend this airline to anyone,0
Heathrow to Mumbai return in Business Class. Good trip both ways. Staff extremely attentive. Nice food and excellent wine. Comfortable flat bed seats although slightly short for me.,1
"Kulula are Always late, booked a flight for my son from Cape Town to JHB. Flight left 2.5 hours late getting him to OR Tambo at 11.30pm with him trying to find an Uber, never using them again. Now I remember why I switched to Safair who are far better and cheaper.",0
I was pleasantly surprised with how professional and friendly the cabin crew were on this flight. The head purser was exceptional in the Business class cabin. It was a shame that there was a last minute aircraft sub from the B737Max but the cabin was clean and immaculate. The amenities were good and inflight service excellent given the length of the flight.,1
Multiple delayed departures. Cancelled flight. Horrible customer service. No airline partners. The low fare was not worth the headaches. My trip in the end cost me more than if i would of bought a first class ticket with a reputable airline. What was suppose to be a 2.5hr flight turned into 2 day nightmare. Had to rent a car to get to my next destination. Spirit refunded some customers but I needed to jump thru more hoops to maybe get a refund for cancelled flight. My relatives who likwise flew spirit this weekend different departure airport where likwise delayed coming and going. Avoid this airline cheap fare not worth it.,0
Virgin is a very good domestic choice. Staff are friendly smart and helpful. People seem to take pride in their work and have helped with every concern I have had. Their Economy product is very good quality yes you pay out of pocket for everything but it's worth it.,1
"Horrible airline, Jetstar Pacific flight seems cheap but if you count the delays and terrible service than you are paying a high price. Had this flight from Danang to Ho chi Minh ""transferred"" to later flights twice as Jetstar is either overbooking or trying to fill all their flights and their motto is screw the customer. The ground staff and service desk staff are rude and speak poor english. If you are transferred you should go to the airport and demand your flight.",0
"No USB chargers. Rude staff, would never fly JetBlue again if I can help it. They treat you like you are a clueless stupid person who has never flown before. The ticket was for overpriced especially considering the plane is so dated there are not even chargers. And the entertainment display is extremely outdated and constantly interrupts what you are watching with advertising. Big thumbs down",0
After reading all the reviews here my wife and I didn't know what to expect from Rouge. We flew from Toronto to Edinburgh on Aug 28 and were very pleasantly surprised. My wife is pushing 6' and not once complained of leg room she did have an aisle seat where I get the window seat and I didn't have a problem either. Food was airplane food what else can I say it was hot and edible didn't once have a problem with any request from the crew. Crew was very professional and courteous young and full of energy. Must say better than some of the flight crew on the mainline AC a smile goes a long way. We flew Rouge on the return trip Sept 12 and experienced the same service. We knew of the inflight entertainment and came prepared I liked using my own IPad I could watch or listen to my own or theirs. We would fly again on Rouge we liked the route and really liked the price over mainline Air Canada.,1
"Jakarta to Hong Kong via Kuala Lumpur. Flight to Kuala Lumpur was 2.5 hours delayed, missed my connection to Hong Kong on December 29, 2019. They put me on the next flight which was the day after.  They destroyed my luggage by leaving it soaking wet in the rain on the tarmac. I complained to their costumer service afterwards, after hundreds of emails still no explanation was given on why the flights were delayed or even acknowledgement that they have made a mistake on handling my luggage. Worst customer service ever.",0
"Istanbul to Stansted. Worst customer service ever. Flight delayed by 1.5 hrs and no proper explanation given why, aircraft not cleaned from previous flight, crew don't speak english, not greeted when entering aircraft, took nearly 2 hours to be served for a drinks and snacks and at the end didn't have what asked for as ran out of menu items on a row 19. Very incompetent staff. Will never ever fly with them again. Absolutely not recommended",0
Flew Qantas Airways from Auckland to Melbourne. Poor customer service. No loyalty in frequent flyer program. Delayed but should be expected from this over priced carrier. Staff clearly need training in all aspects. Wouldn't recommend to anyone. Avoid this carrier as all that matters is profitability.,0
I fly with Ryanair about 20 times a year. They are consistently reliable and punctual. The only time they let me down was when the ash cloud happened. The prices are fantastic but you have to be flexible to get the best deals. They are not BA but you need the mind set that it is like catching a train and do not expect luxury. But it means I visit my house in Portugal regularly and often pay more for the car parking than the flight.,1
"Beijing to Brussels. After taking off they served a meal, I ordered lamb chops and tomato soup, the taste was not stunning, but not too bad, in line with business class meal standards. The flight attendants are very kind, young, feeling very smooth and very natural. I did not get the cabin manager greetings or concerns. But even so, the flight attendant worked really hard.",1
My husband and I flew SpiceJet and I must say it was an overall bad experience. Flight was booked for 10.30 am and at first the flight was delayed to 12.20 pm after which I received a call stating the flight had been further delayed to 1.50pm. I fail to understand why there was a 3.5 hour delay. The staff at the counters did not offer any solution apart from the manager whom we contacted at the end.,0
"I purchased a ticket for my son to bring him home for the holidays. First his flight was canceled before he even left for the airport. They did rebook him on a later flight. When he did get to the airport, his flight was delayed for over three hours. They finally took off and he made it to Chicago Midway where he was supposed to connect to Salt Lake City. Fortunately his plane for connecting flight was also late. Now here is where it gets really good. It is now the middle of the night, the pilots show up, but two flight attendants have not shown up and the airline claims they cannot get hold of them. The flight crew from another airline who had their flight canceled volunteered to step in. Southwest corporate refused. One flight attendant show up but now  pilots have been too long without sleep and so canceled the flight. Now he is stranded in Chicago. What happened to the airline Southwest used to be? We will never use them again.",0
"They require you to check in at the counter a few hours before departure, so standing in line to get my ticket wasted 30 minutes. By the time I made it through Orlando security, the airplane door was already shut and I was not allowed to get on. The attendants at the desk were sweet and told me to call customer service. Customer service was rude to me and erroneously told me there was nothing I could do because I had never checked in, when clearly I had my ticket in my hand. I even tried to speak to a supervisor but they were working at the gates. I was given an office number and I left multiple voicemails and phone calls.  My request for Norwegian to give me back my taxes has gone unanswered.",0
"For an airline that does the same routine flights several times every single day, you would think that they could get it right. Not asking for much but it would be nice to see my checked luggage that saw a total of 1.25 hours in total airtime between two flights and a three hour layover before the second flight to get my back pack from one airplane to the other one parked beside it, you would assume that it's not something you need to be able to split atoms for to get right. Furthermore, the logic of having to pay extra for overweight luggage and have it lost is astonishing. Nothing like paying to have your luggage lost by a company that does the same routine flights seven days a week dealing with everyone's luggage as well. It would be nice to see the employees actually care about these types of situations maybe by starting to make phone calls and send emails and giving you updates rather than play video games on their phones.",0
Hawaii to San Francisco. Nickled and dimed for everything. Forced to watch loud advertisements while seated in the smallest seats I've ever experienced on an aircraft. Really a one of a kind horrendous experience. My wife and I will never fly United again. You shouldn't either.,0
"Our flight to Miami was nicely on time. Our flight to Dallas had a delay of about 45 minutes, which resulted in us missing our flight to Killeen. American Airlines did immediately arrange a hotel, taxi transportation and meal vouchers for us. The staff at their help desk in Dallas were super friendly and very helpful. They booked us for a flight the next morning. All this was free of charge! Thank you American Airlines staff. We will surely recommend this Airline to others. Keep up the good customer service.",1
I was not expecting anything good from TK but I was totally satisfied with their service. Great IFE system and seats. Friendly cabin crew and professional staff. Will fly again with them for sure.,1
"Toronto to Varadero. Terrible customer service. Delay for a flight with no explanation. Will miss the first night of our vacation thanks to this awful airline. If you intend on booking with Sunwing simply to save money, I highly recommend you just spend the extra bit and book with a reliable airline. Never flying with these people again.",0
"They moved my flight one whole day, saying they are very sorry for the inconveniences, but not really providing a reason why they had to do this. I'm not a frequent traveler, but I've taken quite a few fights in the last 40 years and this is the very first time this happens to me. I submitted a claim to see if they could cover the additional lodging costs I had due to this change and was useless. And still they didn't explain why that happened. What's the point of using a cheap airline if they will cause you to spend more on other aspects of the trip. Now I've realized there are reviews posted here by people who have gone through the same. Lesson learned for the future to check reviews before flying with an airline for the first time.",0
"Flew ANA from Frankfurt to Haneda. Fantastic flight and really felt the crew were genuine and hard working. There was also a non Japanese Spanish crew member onboard who was fantastic.The toilets were immaculate, inflight meals wonderful and aircraft was spotless. Also throughout the flight, the crew constantly walked through the cabin offering soft drinks and snacks. Top notch service by far.",1
I recently travelled with my husband on Air Canada Rouge and was not pleased by the experience. My husband is 6'2 and his knees hit the seat in front of him and that was before the lady in front reclined! She should be allowed to recline as that's the type of seats that the airline claims to be selling but it shouldn't have been at the price of the person sitting behind her. If you didn't recline seats were very rigid and uncomfortable. Staff were OK but that was the only decent thing about the flight. Unfortunately this airline apparently tries to save weight by choosing not to stock their food and drink selection so the flight attendants weren't actually able to meet most peoples request. People were very frustrated by the cramped space limited food and overall crummy flight and some took it out on the flight attendants. This airline obviously cares as little about their employees as their customers since they choose to put their flight attendants in these situations. We called ahead of time to try and switch airlines since we originally booked with Air Canada's regular airline and wanted what we had initially booked. The lady on the phone assured us that the reviews on here were false and the Rouge service was the same as their regular service. Absolutely not true and I do not intend to fly with Air Canada Rouge ever again if I can help it.,0
"The second business class trip we have done as a family with China Southern Airlines, and the service is very attentive and caring. The cabin crew are friendly and welcoming and seem very happy in their roles. They speak good English and attempt to improve their language skills at every opportunity. The planes are new and clean and flat beds are comfortable. The only 2 issues have been the airconditioning in the lounge at Guangzhou doesn't always work, and we have also had great difficulty using the website to sign up to the Sky Pearl club.",1
CZ304 and CZ305 flew out 28th Nov back 3rd Jan. Had a great trip in Dec 2013 from Auckland to Gatwick on the new 787 business class. Comfort and service were excellent would fly them again.,1
"Delhi to New York via Beijing. My experience with Air China was horrible. I won't recommend it to anyone. They are unprofessional, not ready to listen to anyone. They changed my boarding pass to another flight. My transit time became 11 hours from 1.5 hours because of this. Didn't give me lounge at first. There was no food arranged by them. No internet. They owe a responsibility to arrange lounge, food, hotel if they are the one changing anyone's flight. Ground staff wasn't listening to anyone. Now after boarding to this changed flight, I got to know that my meal preference were not mentioned in crew members chart. And because of their unexpected change I missed my following flight. They didn't compensate even for that. At New York airport when I tried to explain it to their staff, he gave me one email address to file complaint. Guess what, that email address was not for complaints. It was for baggage claim. Now I had to call their office many times to get right email address. Meanwhile I was directed from one place to other. When you call their phone number, in normal business hours their automated system says "" you are calling outside business hours please call again later."" They do not understand English properly. Their services are poor. Won't fly with them ever. Once was enough for me.",0
We flew from London Heathrow at the start of our holidays and flight was 35 minutes late. On the return journey we flew from Porto to Lisbon 30 minutes late and from Lisbon to London Heathrow 45 minutes late. Need I say more.,0
"KLM changed my flight destination from Buenos Aires to Asuncion without my agreement. I have the next flight the same day from Buenos Aires. No explanations, no refunds. Support only sends copy paste excuse.",0
"Bali to Dubai. Service was ok at the boarding gate since they allowed us to board the aircraft in business class queue prioritising child travelling with us but in the aircraft the crew were horrible. No customer service at all! A crew member spilled water on me while clearing my table. She just said sorry and kept doing what she was doing. She could see I didn't even had a tissue since she clear all away. Didnt even care to bring tissue immediately. Later after she finished all her task then she brought wet wipes. Then My child skipped dinner since she was asleep. Later on when they were servicing breakfast, I asked if they could serve my child first, you know what she replied ""you can ask it yourself"". Such a reputed airline and very poor customer service.",0
My husband and I flew economy via Qatar Airways into Chicago and returned via Philadelphia Dec 2014 and returned Jan 2015. The service both on land and in flight was exceptional!!!! The food and food presentation was first class! A pure joy in relation to other airlines we have flown. The air stewards were always willing to help well dressed and had a good attitude at all times. There is ample leg room even with the entertainment box if there was one at our feet. If you wish to fly Qatar please take a converter for your personal headphones as theirs is a 2 prong. We had a 24 hour lay over in Doha. Qatar Airways granted us an accommodation and food voucher. Our stay in Doha was wonderful and memorable. It is an easy process at Hamad Airport to get the vouchers and board the shuttle to the relevant hotel. I was anxious about this period but it was an easy stay over. My husband and I highly recommend Qatar Airways.,1
Late take off due to weather so they said arrived to late in Charlotte plane to Memphis had already left before we landed. The customer service were rude is the best way I could put it. So we were offered a standby maybe on a flight the next day but it was a maybe at best and then we were told it would be Sunday. Keep in mind this was a planned weekend in Memphis ...by the time we would have gotten there it would be time to come back. To be honest and put it in a nice way the weather was not their fault but they need to be better trained to handle these types of situations. I ended up having to pay 200 dollars for the only room available in the city of Memphis at 1AM and paying 40 dollars for a cab to get here because it was the ONLY option.,0
"It's such a shame because in December I had paid a fee to change my ticket and now I can't change it again apparently even If I offer to pay the change fee. All other airlines let passengers change their tickets a minimum of two times, but I guess you want to give out bad experiences to everyone who tries to book with you. It's unacceptable that you expected me to fly last year during a time when borders were not even fully operating and you would not even let me change the destination so that I could at least fly somewhere where COVID restrictions were better. You only gave me a voucher to use within 2021 as if we were not in the middle of a global pandemic. This specific ticket I had booked with 3 other friends of mine, everyone received a refund from their airline except me and I had been battling with this case for two years now. You should at least have a policy that allows you to change your ticket if it's of a significant amount, which mine was. This is just extremely bad customer service and it's definitely sad that this image is what represents this airline. Thanks for not helping and thanks for overcharging.",0
We had 2 hours to catch a connecting flight from Chengdu to Beijing to Seattle. We had to pick up our luggage at baggage claim in Beijing and then go to terminal 2 to get our prepaid ticket and check our bags and go through the detectors and get out to the correct gate. We probably would not have made it on time without the helpful Hainan Air attendant who walked with us through all of the afore mentioned stations and waited with us. With his help it took 1 hour and 20 minutes which gave us 40 minutes before take off and no stress. I will fly them on my next trip to Asia.,1
First flew with Jet2 August 2013 from Manchester to Crete. Found them to be very good seats seem roomier than rival airlines and aircrew and ground staff extremely helpful. I am flying with them again in 1 months time. No inflight entertainment is the only criticism.,1
Terrible experience with Kenya Airways. Flew from London to Nairobi in September. After losing our luggage they didn't seem very concerned or willing to help. We had to keep complaining to get them to do anything and kept getting passed from one employee to another. The next morning we had to fly from Nairobi to Kilimanjaro on Precision Air which is a subsidiary of Kenya Airways and got bumped from our flight until 12 hours later. Then they didn't take anyone's luggage on the flight! They told us that the luggage would arrive the next day but it didn't arrive until 4 days later. By that time we were on Mount Kilimanjaro using rented and purchased gear. At no time did the airline offer to reimburse us. Finally at the end of our trip we had to fly on Kenya airways from Nairobi to London. We arrived at the airport 3 hours before the flight and when we checked in the agent told us we were on standby! We created a big enough stink that they gave us our boarding passes. Then the flight was 3 hours late departing. Also on both Air Kenya flights the food wasn't very good and the inflight entertainment units didn't work well. If we ever fly back to Africa we would never fly Kenya Airways again.,0
Flew Business Class from Singapore to Colombo then Colombo to Frankfurt and return. Top service excellent food friendly courteous staff and great seat fully flat leather seats on the A330 and big leather recliner seats on the A320. The best part was the price 50 percent cheaper then other business class fares for the same distance. Will use them again.,1
While booking the flight I put the last name wrong that was due to auto fill on my Google. I tried reaching out with in 24 hours to connect and change the last name nobody answered and after 24 hours they are saying that you can't change the last name and cancel the flight and you will get the store credit after deducting 39 dollars each. I cancelled the flight and when tried using the store credit again the issue was the wrong last name. To change that again I have tried contacting at every platform but nobody replied. So I booked my flight again by wasting more money. Your chat service is terrible. I have connected with agents more than 20 times but nobody replied. Left mail and text too nobody replied. I called nobody answered. Hats off to such an awesome customer service. I would suggest please charge more for flights and give good customer support.,0
"Every time I fly with Alaska Airlines they stuff me in a middle seat between large, rude people, who give me no space, trigger severe anxiety attacks, and make my flights uncomfortable. This time, I followed a friend's advice, and asked about changing seats or upgrading, and was refused. Covid is still real, quit stuffing people in these planes like sardines, or you are just contributing to the spread of the virus.",0
Helsinki to Hong Kong. This is my first flight on the new A350 with Finnair and its a massive improvement from my previous flights with Finnair on the old 340. The cabin is very spacious and bright and the seats are comfortable with a full Flat Bed. You get a nice Doona to sleep in. Food and drink service is standard but enjoyable. Finnair places itself on the lower end of the price ratio so I think its good value. The only drawback I think is the fact that there is not one Finnish flight attendant on the Asian flights which seems strange for a Finnish Airline. All that said the service was very good and it is a very quiet and comfortable aircraft to fly on.,1
"San Francisco to Tokyo Narita. SFO lounge closed at international terminal, food was terrible, bag was lost and delivered only a day later despite a direct flight. Terrible service. Every time I use United Airlines I instantly regret it. The ground staff wasn't helpful nor friendly in SFO",0
"Montreal to Indianapolis via Charlotte. I was not able to get on board for my connection at CLT, when they gave me my boarding pass I didn't had a seat so I goes to the onboarding agent counter to ask her some questions and she told me the flight was overbooked by 17 people .... how it can possible? They wanted to give me a money compensation but I didn't care about money compensation because it was a business flight so the company who I work for was paying, I missed the diner kickoff of an intern technician competition it's priceless. So I was stuck in CLT, the sweet onboarding agent found me a flight on the next morning but the new American Airlines supervisor didn't want to give me an hotel compensation for the night because I was supposedly not there when they call me for boarding ... but I was there 30 min before boarding. The boarding agent was arguing with him to make him understood but he didn't want to understand, unacceptable! October 21th 2022, IND to MTL, I had a connection to PHL. During the night I received an email, the flight was cancelled and they give me another flight 5 hours late in the day. New connection CLT, okay fine I go to the airport, the new flight is delayed about 30min then 45, 60, 75, 120 min. Enough delayed to miss my connection to CLT. Unacceptable! The boarding agent found me a flight next morning, They give me a night at the hotel and then I took my flight on the next morning. Everybody told me to avoid American Airlines and now I understand why. Trust me I will never travel with them once it's over.",0
Flew Delta Air Lines from Kansas City to Atlanta. On Monday while flying I abruptly got sick and I just wanted to thank the flight attendants on board for taking such good care of me. They were doing everything they could to try to help me not feel as miserable and I want to say kudos for having such caring team members.,1
"Las Vegas to Phoenix. Nearly every flight I've ever flown with them is delayed. And they don't let you know until the time the plane was scheduled to board passes. Don't try to make reservations or show tickets, because Allegiant is by far the most unreliable airline I've ever given the opportunity to earn my business.",0
London to Tokyo return. The service from London to Japan was pleasant and air hostess made me feel welcome. However on the return the cabin staff  ignored me when I asked for water or tea. My partner was pestered to move seat forward by staff so that older folks behind us had enough leg space! I was so annoyed as I have paid for my seat and checked on to see if seats was moved back. I was approached by staff later asking me to put down the window shutter when the cabin lights were down. I felt that they were more concerned about Japanese passengers then non Japanese passengers. I didn't complain to air hostess at time as I wanted to just go home. However this experience has totally discouraged me to fly with ANA again.o,0
"Flew Ryanair from Dublin to Copenhagen. Very warm welcome. Superb cabin crew who showed personality and humour. Great sales pitch when selling products, food etc. All in all a very pleasant and comfortable flight. Thanks to this particular team.",1
"Had a wonderful flight. I forget the mans name, but he was amazing, he helped me find my ID that I lost. He also changed my seat for me because I was worried of covid. Also made everyone on the plane laugh! He was great, amazing service from him.",1
"Will not fly with Hawaiian Airlines again. Booked day flight specifically for views between Kauai and Maui, they changed us from a window seat to the last row even though we booked and confirmed a month ago. This is the flight I was most looking forward to in the islands, experience ruined. Took forever to board, had to wait for another Hawaiian air flight to depart for 30 min on tarmac despite arriving on time. You have other options nowadays, take them.",0
"If you value your time, I recommend avoiding American Airlines. I was flying from Albuquerque, NM to Detroit, MI with a layover in Dallas, TX. Our plane required maintenance which delayed my flight by an hour. This caused me to miss my connecting flight to Detroit, so I was stranded in Dallas. After waiting over two hours in the customer service line, the airline provided me a hotel credit for the night and rescheduled my flights to Detroit. However, the hotel they provided was 40 minutes away from the airport, and I ran into additional delays the next day due to my plane being grounded. They ended up having to acquire another plane which delayed my flight an additional 2 hours. Overall, an entire day was wasted because of these delays, and the primary cause was poor plane maintenance which is concerning. Once again, if you value your time, I recommended avoiding this Airline.",0
"Hong Kong to Bangkok, and my first time with Orient Thai Airlines, and I am very satisfied with both the price and service. Orient Thai was cheaper than Air Asia and the Boeing 747 was very spacious with comfortable seats. Also they served breakfast airline meal with drinks that tasted ok.",1
16th April Stansted to Otopeni FR1005. I flew from Stansted to Bucharest. Filthy seats cabin crew that gave the safety instruction only in English despite the fact that the flight was to Bucharest behind me was a non English speakers couple which asked me to translate what the hostess said. Very disappointing!,0
Johannesburg to New Delhi via Abu Dhabi. Very disappointed with service and food. We order special Asian veg meal. Was awful. Same with snack. Could not eat anything. Whole flight nothing to eat. Allocated me and my wife separate seat on Abu Dhabi to Delhi sector. Manage to get it together any how. Was thinking got the ticket for cheap but now feel like total waste. Emirates is the best for us. Hope not to travel again in Etihad. Flight attendents very unprofessional. Ask for coke said we don't have its finished. Then later on other attendent gave. Where she got it from. Pathetic.,0
"I bought tickets of Pegasus Airlines in the early March 2022 because Russian airlines stopped flying abroad. In 10 days after that Pegasus announced that flight was cancelled. I chose the refund option and Pegasus sent me an email that my card is unavailable for refund. I replied providing my account details and asking about further steps. But after that Pegasus never replied. I tried to remind them several times, but they still keep silence",0
Istanbul to Washington IAD with Turkish Airlines. I tried to obtain an status match with another Star Alliance partner. They insisted upon a copy of the plastic card which my Star Alliance Airline cannot produce. My Star Alliance airline indicated this is not possible. TA's miles and smiles program website is impossible to use and slow.,0
"Stansted to Athens. This was my first time that I flew with RyanAir and I was quite worried having heard many people complaining about this budget airline. I was very nicely surprised as my experience was great. Plane space was the same as most airlines, they were punctual on their times, the staff was amazing! Never seen more polite, helpful people. I was travelling myself with my two year old child and they were so nice, attentive beyond expectations. Also service overall was great with variety in food options. I would use them again.",1
"Booked ticket from Toronto to Montreal directly from their website with my personal mail ID and contact details. They cancelled the flight, at the last minute they said flight cancelled, gave another one for next day. At least they should inform one day prior or have to arrange another flight or airline at the same time. This is not for the first time. Even though I am aware about their pathetic service, I choose this one only because there was no alternate option. They do not value the customers time, they behave like its their right to cancel any flight at any time. Also they haven't provided me food and accommodation. Its around 8 hours, my luggage is not returned, waiting at the airport. Very very bad service Porter Airlines, not at all recommended to any one.",0
London to Beijing in July. The seat was uncomfortable and did not recline properly. The food was far below normal international airline standards. Staff were unhelpful and curt. The inflight entertainment was limited and clearly designed more for a mainland China audience.,0
"Volaris is by far the worst airline that I have ever flown. Not were the flights just delayed but they boarded us then had to take us off for maintenance and didn't help us change our connecting flights. Just said not to worry they will handle them when you get to Mexico city. Needless to say after trying to run and catch my gate which I could've made they said I couldn't board because I needed to go get my bag. Ended up missing the connection and the next available flight wasn't till the next morning. Their customer service was horrible. They are completely disorganized, rude and not helpful at all and had zero compensation for all of the people. Nothing from food, to hotel rooms, to transportation, credits, or refunds. The airplane also had no air conditioning, food, water, or anything. Not only did they waste my money and time but didn't even help resolve the issues at hand.",0
This airline was very helpful during a very difficult time. They did not deliberately increase their prices during the mad panic caused by the bad weather in Europe in the days before Christmas. My original booking to travel London to Athens was with KLM and then I was passed to Air France. Neither of them could organize things properly and after endless problems it took them 4 days to get me only as far as Paris with no hope of leaving for at least a day. Aegean came to my rescue and even though they also took off late they made sure I did not miss my next flight with them to a Greek island. During this 4 day nightmare I had to rebook my domestic flight several times with Aegean and they were very accommodating.,1
Atlanta to Newport News. On boarding the aircraft the pilot stated that there a possibility of turbulent weather entourage. For that reason it was unsafe for beverage service an all flight attendants would remain seated. Into the flight we noticed First Class was served snacks and multiple beverages. The remainder of the aircraft was offered water after First Class was done. This is wrong we had paid for our Premium Economy upgrade.,0
"Nashville to Las Vegas. Worst airline ever, the free movies and entertainment is useless, the free WiFi is spotty at best and when I applied for paid WiFi it never worked. Seats are incredibly small and close together. I will probably never fly with SW again. I won't mind paying extra if that need be because all other airlines I flown with are so much better.",0
"Mumbai to Kanpur. I must say it was my worst journey ever. When I booked my flight the time was 10.45 am and after a week they messages saying that it will be taking off at 1.45 pm. The flight took off after 2.30pm, I dont understand why they don't value time. I must suggest please don't book with SpiceJet. Also for luggage, at the time of booking they dont indicate that you can't take cabin luggage and the day before the flight they circulated a message that no cabin luggage was allowable. If there was an option to give a minus star I would.",0
Manila to Legazpi. Cancelled my flight due this pandemic. Opted put the money to my travel fund that didn't take me more than 2 minutes to do. Validity is for one year. Good job Cebu Pacific,1
I will boycott this airline until the day I die. I have never experienced such rude staff and incredibly unorganized airline. American Airlines caused me to miss two flights in one day and caused me to have the worst travel day ever. I will never go through this company again. I rather fly JetBlue.,0
"Overall the flight from Istanbul to Dubai was perfect. On time, foods were perfect, cabin crew friendly, entertainment system with movies and music. Seats were comfortable and no problem during the flight.",1
"Melbourne to Singapore. Cabin crew refused to ask passenger in front of me to pull the chair backup when he served meals. I found it very unprofessional. I asked to speak to his supervisor, he then gave in to ask the front seat passenger to pull his chair up for me to have my meal. No more Singapore Airlines. I got the connected flight from Singapore to Nepal on SilkAir and to my surprise, before even handed my meal, the cabin crew asked the front seat passenger to pull up his chair for me to have my meal. I am not special, they have done that to everyone passenger.",0
Dublin to London City. The lady who checked me in at Dublin was lovely. I saw her help an elderly gentleman and she did so with kindness and professionalism. Boarding was efficient and the interior of the aircraft was clean and the crew were polite and worked hard. Arrival was on time and baggage delivered promptly. I have no complaints and will gladly use again!,1
"Phoenix to Las Vegas. I wish I could say I have flown with Spirit, but I haven't. I was visiting Arizona for one day and I have been stranded for 3 due to 3 subsequent flight cancellations. I wasn't worried about the first one, but they cancel the flights just hours before boarding and only notify you via email. I ended up paying 5x the cost of the ticket to get out with a different airline because they lead you on by rebooking you a flight soon afterwards, which will also be cancelled. So eventually, you will have to pay for a last minute seat at well over full price with some other airline. Save yourself the time and money and don't bother with them.",0
"Have not flown SAS Scandinavian for several years, and I did not realize they are no longer a full service airline. Paying Business class for a budget experience is silly, I will avoid this airline if possible, and if not, then only fly economy.",0
Denver to San Francisco. Frontier has little to no customer service. On both my departing and returning flights the people loading the plain were extremely rude. Not only were both flights delayed each way but when we asked what the problem was the frontier representatives told us to mind or own business. I couldn't believe the way these people treat their customers. They should be ashamed of themselves.,0
"Dhaka to New Delhi via Kolkata. The in flight service is terrible!  The seat was are broken, bad quality and no leg space at all, there are other aircraft small but better in terms of leg space, but this is really terrible. Something has to be done also about the services.",0
"Very rude call centre people once they take your money from card you are abandoned as no help you get from them. Flights have been cancelled, no email notification, no live information, no refund after 3 months! This is the last time I am using them.",0
"Indianapolis to Newark. The flight delayed for 7 hours because of waiting for aircraft. We had to fly with different airline to get to our destination on time to attend an important event. Furthermore, without notification, our seats on a return flight was automatically cancelled. As a result, we have to take a much later flight to go back home. Our overall experience with United airlines has been terrible!",0
"Vacation with Sunwing in Dec 9 2013 to Cancun. On the way back after 2 hour delay we were finally on board. When everybody was on board we were told we will fly to Winnipeg because the crew will be working over 15 hours if we flew to Vancouver as scheduled. The delay was over 10 hours. We didn't even have enough food and water on the plane. Contacted Sunwing customer service after about a month's time was told it was because of ""technical problem"" so they will not be responsible.",0
New York to New Orleans. The economy seating was ridiculously close I'm only six feet tall and my knees were touching the seat in front of me . Delta air line is very greedy for money. My last time flying Delta.,0
"Stockholm to Amsterdam with SAS Scandinavian. The flight was delayed 40 minutes first without any prior announcement, we were supposed to depart at 16.15 and then several minutes before the actual take off time it was changed to 16.55. then, when we got on the flight, it was announced that the plane had missed some its takeoff time and the next time to take off was at 17.55. The cabin crew did not apologise properly, they just asked to ""have more patience"". Also, they didn't offer any free beverages and drinks despite the delay. Even drinking water was only available to buy. I don't think they deserve even those three stars status they claim to have.",0
"This is a junk airline with no shame on overbooking flights. They have no regard to your personal plans as part of the trip. My family checked in at the airport, paid for luggage, received boarding pass, cleared security and at the gate they were told there are no seats available. And they want them to find another flight on a different date. How can you issue a boarding pass without property accounting for seats on the aircraft? What that tells that they absolutely have no accountability for their actions. On top of it there is really no government oversight on this process. We will stop flying Spirit henceforth. Yea. I get it that they are the cheapest. But cheap is not everything in life.",0
"They cancelled our flight and the next one was more than a day later! They refused to give us any compensation or place to stay which most airlines provide in case of delays and cancellations. On call, which was very hard to get through to, they did not help at all. They said sorry but we can not do anything. Even the refund they did not want to process. It is the worst and most stressful experience with any airline so please do not trust them. They seem to do this often form other reviews which i did not know of before booking.",0
"Very poor experience with Vietjet flying Hanoi to Ho Chi Minh City. Checked in by a staff member who was more interested in gossiping with her colleague and looking at her phone. The boarding pass issued stated a boarding time that was significantly later than our scheduled flight time. I only noticed this afterwards and went back to query it with another member of staff. They told me the flight was delayed so I had been moved to a different flight. This had not been explained at any point at the check in desk, nor did any of the signs or screens indicate a delay to my flight, which is why I was so confused. The new flight they assigned me to did not suit as I had to be in SGN for a certain time so I asked if there was any earlier flight available. After being ignored for about ten minutes while the agents dealt with other customers first, who had joined the queue after me, I did eventually get assigned to an earlier flight, but this flight also ended up being delayed. The delay for this flight was not announced at any point or indicated on the screens around the terminal, only on the screen at the boarding gate, where they simply changed the boarding time, rather than actually announce it as a delay. None of the staff knew what was happening and in my entire dealings with them I found them to be terribly disorganised and next time I am in Vietnam I will pay extra to fly with Vietnam Airlines and will avoid VietJet.",0
"US Airways now merged into American Airlines does not seem to have made much effort into improving service! Despite a good aircraft and a well extended network, with an IFE not functioning on my seat and a crew with a ""it's just a job"" attitude, the experience was unpleasant!",0
"Highly recommended everyone avoid using JetBlue Airways! The 7 hr delay, 5 hr inside the aircraft. JetBlue staff showed me how they don't care about the customers and people at all. The staff are rude and not helpful at all, customer service is rude and not helpful. Don't waste your time traveling with Jetblue.",0
"Multiple times the flight was delayed with no notifications. Rude staff. Then they gave an update that our plane landed and it took over an hour to get the plane ready. Would advise not to use Spirit Airlines, I won't ever again. I would give them no stars if allowed.",0
Rome to Athens. This must be the worst flight I have ever had. One of the most uncomfortable planes I have ever been on. Rude air hostesses which where talking down to passengers and giggling all through the flight at the back of the plane. I am surprised they are still allowed to fly with such service and state of aircraft. Only positive in the whole trip was the ground staff service at transfer desk.,0
"Frankfurt to Seoul via Hong Kong. The flights were really pleasant. Starting off with the ground crew at FRA airport who were nice and helpful. Cabin crew was incredible on all flights. The food from HKG to ICN was pretty bad, on the other flights it was good! Would recommend the airline.",1
"Atlanta to Philadelphia. No more American Airlines, 3 hours delay and they treat passages terribly. I missed my to be at my god daughter's mass today and almost missed a chance to get on the 2nd standby flight. Customer service is worst. They don't even look at my face as talking to me or barely want to talk to me. What kind of business is this?",0
Two flights in 60 days that have made my fiancee and I miss appointments. I literally cannot get anyone at American to answer the phone after being on hold for over three hours last night and over two hours this morning. I am a Platinum Advantage member as well. Their customer service is absolutely ludicrous and I would warn everyone to have a very low expectation of American Airlines.,0
"Barcelona to Lyon, and they seated my partner and I on opposite ends of the plane and then expected us to pay a fee to be sat together!! Then when we board the plane we see that there are plenty of space seats together. I understand it's a low cost airline but that's a pretty cynical way to make money and leaves you feeling swindled. Shows Vueling have a total contempt for their customers.",0
"Dublin to New York. The seats are cramped beyond belief, the website for checking in is atrocious, the policy of not issuing seats if a flight is booked 72 hours before takeoff is a disaster if travelling with children, and the 'lost and found' service has been outsourced in a way that makes sure that items of value are never 'found'. If there was a way to avoid Aer Lingus to get to Ireland, i would take it.",0
Recent trip from LHR to HK in PE. Footrest jammed in the up position all the way. Unable to get out of seat without a lot of difficulty. Couldn't even put it down for landing so no chance of brace position if necessary. An all round awful experience. Never again.,0
Palma to Lisbon. The aircraft was very dirty and smelly which made for a very disturbing flight. They simply don't clean their aircraft after their passengers deboard. Flight attendants only job seem to be selling overpriced food and were incredibly unfriendly even to kids onboard.,0
They talked down to us in front of our children and stopped the plane and threatened to kick us out for eating and drinking with no mask? They stopped the plane for 15 minutes to make empty threats about masks and took off anyway.,0
"Purchased 2 seats on Frontier Airline website for me and my girlfriend for flight to New Jersey, got to the airport only to find out the flight was over booked and my seats were sold to someone else. We were placed in separate seats, which was very stressful for my girlfriend who has a phobia of flying. I requested a refund but was denied. Atrocious customer service.",0
"I have flown with Reginal Express or 'REX' as known locally several times previously. Last Thursday 14th February 2019 I boarded a flight back home to Adelaide from Mount Gambier where I had been on a business trip. I was greeted by Carly who was our flight attendant for the flight. I was pleasantly surprised by her level of service and professionalism. I can say every other time I had flown REX the service was good, although on this day it was outstanding. She made everybody on board feel welcome, she provided snacks and drinks to all passengers and walked the aisle regularly to enquire if any of the passengers required anything, I'd like to personally congratulate her on her level of service, well done! I would highly recommend REX to anyone flying regionally within Australia.",1
"Christchurch to Auckland. The worst service, flight delayed with more than 3 hours. While awaiting I had to go and ask for regular updates. Staff was rude and laughed at me while getting upset. When laying a complaint they ask how they can help or make it better I said that they should put us on a later flight Sunday as they already took 3 hours of my time spend with family. They said they can't do that without additional cost. Don't ask me what can I do and then say no. Absolutely useless only gave a 1 because I can't give a 0.",0
Flew Manchester to Ibiza return. Outbound was acceptable with at least a map to know where the plane is. On the return the seats were appalling. The magazines and safety booklets were in a slot behind the person in front's headrest and therefore nowhere to put a plastic bottle or wedge a book in. The cabin staff were nothing but rude and unhelpful when we asked why this facility had been taken away suggesting that they were offering more leg room! I certainly will never do short haul with this airline again and only premium economy in long haul!,0
"Avoid this Airline at all costs for long haul flights. If you buy a ticket with this airline you only have yourself to blame when things go wrong. For the second time in 2 weeks Royal Brunei have cancelled their Brunei to London flight resulting in delays of more than 12 hours and hundreds of stranded passengers. They knew full well when we left Manilla that there was no serviceable aircraft waiting in Brunei and one was having to be flown in from Jeddah. Despite knowing they had 100 plus passengers arriving their response was nothing short of appalling. Staff giving contradictory info as to what next. Passengers left outside the terminal in the early hours of the morning to wait up to two further hours for 16 seat buses to get checked into a dirty smelling hotel with no food and water provided. Passengers in wheelchairs just dumped outside. The replacement flight was due to leave 11.45 next day this also delayed due to ""technical difficulties"" on a different 787. Ground staff could not care less, we had to argue for nearly 60 minutes just to get access to WIFI so we could update friends and family of our late arrival. To top it off despite having our bags in the airport overnight they did not join us when we eventually arrived in London. 28 hours to get from Brunei to London. I've been flying over 20 years and we've all had delays it's part and parcel of long haul travel. The difference here is how Royal Brunei conducted themselves both during and after. They should be absolutely ashamed of the way they treat their customers. Royal Brunei point blank refuse to compensate passangers. Lesson learned I guess, beter to pay that little bit extra and fly with a experienced long haul carrier that holds that 5 star rating.",0
"Guangzhou to London with China Southern Airlines in Economy Class, in September. The seat is not big enough, but the flight is on time with good food and beverage, and fairly good service on the plane. The most important is the ticket fare is the cheapest comparing to those offered by another airlines, actually it is a good value for the money. I recommend the China Southern Airlines.",1
28th April 2015 flight TK2019. Night flight domestic from Kayseri to Istanbul. Flight delayed 30 minutes. Check in was fast and efficient. Check in staff were friendly and helpful. Airbus 321 fairly full flight. Meal was a sandwich with delicious apple cake and red bean salad. Beverage service hot and cold provided. IFE not available but it was only 15 hours. Overall a nice flight for first time flying Turkish.,1
"Pittsburgh to Gatwick  via Keflavik. WOW air simply don't. Worst flight ever and that's saying something. I tried it out to see if it gave an option for those in the team flying to the US. Home leg i arrived at LGW 10 hours late, not a sign of free water in our 2 three hour tarmac stops even though passengers were standing at the door so as not to pass out. Flying narrow body planes to the US is madness a weather event gave us excess head winds and the pilot had to divert to Goose Bay to top up the fuel. Given a 1 star as zero was not offered.",0
"Prague to Amsterdam. Forced to check a carry on bag at the gate, pay 45 Euro and then they lost my bag. To make matters worse I was connecting on a different airline to Toronto and then Vancouver. So I had to exit the secured area and pass security a second time. Rude, impatient, dismissive. A truly bad experience from start to finish. I will never fly with them again.",0
Excellent cabin crew both flights to Thailand. Very quiet and comfortable trip. Highly recommend and would not hesitate to travel Jetstar again in the future.,1
"A better experience on Scoot than my trip with Singapore Airlines. The plane is quite new and has excellent facilities. The seats, cabin and toilets are clean. Scoot crew somehow provide better service than my Singapore Airlines flight. I had a great experience flying Scoot despite being no frills.",1
"Manchester to Los Angeles via Heathrow with British Airways. Pre paid for emergency exit seats for our flight and was allocated these at check in. 45 minutes later when trying to board flight, we were stopped and told we were now at the back of the plane with our tickets given to BA staff, who were sitting comfortably. It transpires we have to contact BA ourselves to get our money back after filling in a form. This sums up British Airways now, as an airline where customers are effectively charged for something they aren't provided with and then BA making it so difficult that they hope they get to keep the money, customer service is non existent. Other than this, all 4 flights we took were late, our son was given child meals we hadn't booked, the choice of meals was one of only two options both were disgusting, one of the seats was broke on a new A380 and the seats were incredibly uncomfortable in that you could feel the metal frame as there is no padding in the seats. An internal Virgin America flight we took had more space and more comfortable seating than BA's A380. I cannot find anything positive to say about them.",0
Flew Business Class with my wife from Dubai to Miami via Toronto. Arrived in Miami on 22nd December 2022 but Air Canada had lost both of our bags. We completed a lost bags form and were told we'd be contacted within 24hrs. Problem was that we were going on a cruise to the Caribbean departing on 24th December. On 23rd December the bags were no where in sight so we made the decision to go and buy new clothes. Three days into the cruise we were told by Air Canada that our bags had arrived in Sao Paolo. When we checked in at Miami airport to return to Dubai our bags were given back to us. I have registered a compensation claim as we spent USD 3k on new clothes and luggage but received no response. I will never ever travel with Air Canada again.,0
Flew from Honolulu to Incheon to Shanghai and from Chongqing to Incheon to Honolulu. Could not ask for more in terms of comfort food and service. All staff were friendly courteous and always available. Food was exceptional. Highly recommend.,1
"Gdansk to Bristol. Having never flown with Ryanair before I assumed it would be similar to other budget airlines I have flown with in the past. I was shocked at the filth I had to sit in on the flight. The seats and carpets were covered in crumbs and all sorts of rubbish. I pulled down the table to discover it was encrusted with food from previous customers, and absolutely disgusting. I will never fly with Ryanair again. They charge premium prices for the lowest service. I'm sticking with easyjet.",0
"On time, good service and the crew smile. Drinks are offer with coffee or tea and water plus every passenger received a bun. They encourage passenger to recycle their plastic water bottle by remove sticker and the crew collect the empty bottle.",1
"Boston to Lubbock via Dallas Ft Worth. I was at the gate with time to spare. I purposely did not check a bag, because I wouldn't have time to go to baggage claim when I landed. I understand when they just check it below, then hand it to you when you get off, but they fully checked it. I told her I didn't want it checked. She tried to act like she was doing me a favor by not charging me. Additionally, they tried to check it for the wrong city! The lady was extremely rude about it as well.",0
"Worst airline I have used. The staff were rude, the  airline changed my seat just for no reason.",0
"Chicago to Miami. We had an issue with wheelchair assistance on the ground at Miami airport, but upon reaching out to United they immediately rectified the situation. Everyone and everything else about our experience with United was wonderful! Exactly as we expected and more. Very friendly and helpful staff, and even better customer service. Thank you!",1
"Bradley to Hilton Head via Charlotte. This is the worst flight company I have ever used. Our initial flight was delayed by 3.5 hours. My second flight is, as expected, delayed. My trip time has been doubled. I will never use this airline again and do NOT recommend. I should have drove.",0
London to Istanbul on 13 February. One of most rubbish and rude customer services. Our flight had 12 hours delay and when I claim for compensation for first few days and weeks tried to play the game and when they did find I am serious they start offering. And after except their offer they start playing gave to give me the cheque. Several times I called them and they pretended not hearing my voice but clearly you can understand they are pretending. I am really sorry for people who spending their money for this rubbish airline.,0
"Hefei to New York transfer in Guangzhou. This is the first time to take China Southern and the ticket is so cheap. New York to Guanzghou there was passenger in need of medical assistance, and the flight attendants broadcast, searching for the physician help and solved the issues. Both Chinese and western style meal except for the plate without fruit in dinner time. I was confused there was no fruit in plate. The aircraft is comfortable. I will support this airline again next time.",1
"Hong Kong to Amman via Abu Dhabi. Very bad experience, I had to stay in Abu Dhabi for about 12 overnight, ground staff didn't afford me a hotel for rest for the reason I purchased the ticket from China, and it is not in my route. I think the ticket was issued from Etihad system, and they know the connection time. The staff is acting like they are giving you from their own money. I asked in two counters, the first one gave the answer that my ticket does not include this service and I have to pay, and maybe my nationality will not allow me to get a hotel. Then the other counter informed me with reason I shared above.",0
"I've not had the chance to fly Air Canada for a few years and I am pleased to say the experience was just as good as before with only one letdown. My checked bag did not make it onto the plane! It was however returned to me two days later in Duluth, USA. The flight left on time and arrived on time, both of which are a big plus these days. The seat was very comfortable, the food and service were great and the IFE was good enough.",1
In past 6 months i have flown 6 international flights and 4 domestic flights with Vietnam Airlines. Have flown Frankfurt to Hanoi return. Hanoi to Nha Trang. Hanoi to Da Nang. and Hanoi to Bangkok return. Very friendly staff and excellent food onboard. Will be flying them again soon to Hanoi.,1
I booked a ticket for October from Colorado Springs to San Diego. 3 weeks later I received an email saying my itinerary changed. I needed to rebook because Frontier stopped this service. My ticket was non and void. Now I have to go through Denver. Thank you frontier for the inconvenience of not servicing all the customers in Colorado springs. I was given a voucher for 100.00 that needs to be booked in 90 days. WOW! What happened to booking in a year With a voucher? Our city is big enough to support the service but this inconvenience is it really worth ticking off Colorado springs?,0
London to HKG business. Upgraded from PE class so good start. Lounge nice quiet. Boarding chaotic due to families with teenagers choosing the ' small child board early ' call. Lovely onboard crew responsive and friendly. Food great TV excellent slept a lot. Delayed after landing but captain updated us regularly and as usual good effort to transfer connecting pax efficiently. Worlds most efficient airline.,1
"I booked my ticket to fly from Vancouver to Singapore and the from Singapore, my transit was on a different itinerary from Singapore to Papua New Guinea. I was denied boarding in Turkey, reason being that if I want to transit in Singapore, I have to transit to Singapore Airlines and not any other airlines. I was stranded there for 2 days, The options they gave me was to change my flight in Singapore from Air Niugini to Singapore or go back to Canada, I explained to them that Singapore Airlines don't go to my country, they said that's the only option if you want to go to your country. I just said, give me another ticket back to Canada, they did after 10 hours. Thank God, my PCR test was still valid so I can travel back to Canada. Their customer service is the worst in the world. You cannot talk to them, they are useless.",0
"Paris to Bangkok via Muscat. My wife and I were traveling to Thailand on holiday. We like having a stop on the way as find long flights tiring and boring. Check in at Paris was speedy and directed to the Cathay lounge which was perfectly acceptable. I find it very surprising that when an airline has 2 air bridges available to them they only use one. Add to this that they do not manage Business Boarding very well I find incredible! This was one area, the only area really that Oman Air let them selves down! All our flights were on time and the service was excellent and food was varied and tasty served with some very nice wines. The aircraft were nearly new and everything worked. What more can I say, would we fly with them again, yes, without doubt!",1
"Stansted to Rome. Flew with Ryanair back in October. Both flights were on time. We had priority boarding so we were one of the first people on the plane. We had to get a coach to the plane at Rome. On other flights once you get on the coach it's a free for all to get on the plane but this time they had split the coach into two for priorty boarding and other, so priorty boarding was let off the coach first. Will use Ryanair again.",1
"Glasgow to Toronto. I was not looking forward to travelling Air Canada rouge after reading the reviews but was pleasantly surprised at how good a journey my husband and I had. The food was good, the staff were good and the seating was perfectly fine. My husband is a big man and we are both tall and we found the seating to be perfectly adequate. We knew there was no inflight entertainment so we had plenty of reading materials.",1
Very comfortable leather seat. Quick boarding at TXL. They gave snacks and drinks during the flight from TXL to VCE. Very polite and friendly crew.,1
Flew from San Francisco to Jacksonville FL. Flight crew acted like they hated their job never smiled once poor leg room and no onboard amenities except a glass of water or coke. At least Delta gives you a cookie. Pay extra for JetBlue they have by far superior service.,0
"We are in a pandemic and the flight were extremely pack. Even on the flight back the pilot advised that we were over weight. The group that we were traveling with, we all paid for seats so we can try and sit together but when we all checked on we all had different seats that we did not pay for. We went to the counter and they advise that they never heard of anyone paying for seats and that it was impossible. They said in order to try and sit next to the person you had to checked back within 45 minutes to boarding time. We showed them the receipts and they said to request a refund. Two days later I'm requesting the refunds and the customer service rep just told me she cannot provide me the refund since I volunteer to move my seat, when I actually didn't volunteer. American Airlines seriously was not the best experience. I probably will not be flying with them.",0
"Great Staff in flight, really nice with children. Ground service really friendly in Lisbon. Pleasant flight with a lot of information during the flight.",1
We arrive at STL airport to find that we are a minute late to be able to check our baggage. They then schedule us on the next flight which means we now have a layover and will be getting to our destination two hours late. After waiting for our new flight to board we are notified that our flight is late and we will have to take a different flight now which will make us now another hour late on top of the other two hour delay. To top it all off they didn't have two seats available together and not once did a staff member apologize.,0
AA63 CDG to MIA AA931 MIA to EZE AA990 GIG to MIA AA62 MIA to CDG. Worst cabin service unimaginable seats still using the ancient TV screens on ceiling on Trans Atlantic and South American flights! Imagine looking at a small screen on top of the ceiling during a 10 hour flight. They only screen 1 movie on the entire flight.,0
"Lisbon to Paris CDG. Flight operated by Joon by Air France. Ticket at affordable price, with very good value for money. Ground service was kind and very fast. Comfortable seat and very helpful Cabin Staff service. Fast and free WiFi on board. Airline highly and definitely recommend.",1
"Ho Chi Minh to Singapore. A great experience traveling with tiger air. It was a first for all of us, experiencing such good service from the staff at the service counter and on the airplane. We were pleased with customer service especially with the well wishes upon knowing it is one of our member's birthday. Also, the cake which was presented onboard the plane by the staff was unexpected and surpirising. Travelling with Tigerair was definitely better than expected.",1
"Guangzhou to New York. The service of China Southern Airline deserve a praise. The economy seat has enough spacs for my legs and comfortable position for my head and neck. Even though the flight hours is as long as 15 hours, I could find the staff during the fight and they to ask if I need any services.  However, I would suggest the airline improve their food and beverage to meet the need of customers in a very dry environment.",1
"Tampa to Seattle via Denver. Worst airline there is. Never on time, were supposed to leave 30 minutes ago and still sitting on plane waiting to leave for some strange reason. Unacceptable and wouldn't recommend them to anyone.",0
"Just horrible. The worst experience ever. I booked the flight online and it was mentioned that the luggage is included. At check in desk they say that I have to pay for it. The price was almost the same as ticket itself. This is real scam, show one price while booking and charge extra in the airport. I would have never booked this ticket if I had known the final price. All staff is extremely rude, doesn't know anything and doesn't will to help. They can't speak English properly and were just laughing. During flight itself passengers around me removed the masks and cabin crew did not react. The man behind me was playing the loud games after the announcement to switch off the electronic devices. He kept kicking my seat, sneezing without even a mask.",0
Flew Business class LHR to IST and IST to BKK on 26 February and returned on 11 March. Excellent service and food throughout the flights. Only complaint is on the final leg on A321 basically economy seats with middle seat turned down. Extremely uncomfortable seats for over 3 hour flight. Although in flight service was good no IFE.,1
"Sydney to Manchester via Dubai with Emirates. Chauffeur, included in the price, picked us up on time and following check in we settled in the lounge to await our flight. Flight left on time and arrived Dubai early. Emirates A380 has excellent suites in first with 23"" TV, privacy door which make your space entirely private and very comfortable seat. Following takeoff, watched a movie, got the seat into bed position with mattress and duvet, closed the doors and slept. Woke after 6 hours, ordered food and about two hours from Dubai used one of the two showers. Onward flight to Manchester, again A380, was the same and using the shower meant we arrived fresh. Chauffeur drive again home.",1
"San Francisco to Guangzhou on China Southern Airlines Boeing 787. The flight attendants were friendly and polite. When I putted on my heavy luggage to the rack very hardly, the stewardess help me a lot, but it was also heavy to her as well. When I waited for the bathroom, the staff kindly chat with me to make sure I got best services, even helped me open the door.",1
"Very disappointing indeed! As a Kenyan I wanted to believe that Kenya Airways is indeed the ""pride of Africa"". Perhaps it was at a time. Recently it is starting to be an ""embarrassment of Africa"". Service has deteriorated to poor levels. Our departure to Dubai was delayed for almost 3 hours. We were bundled out of the business lounge only to spend another hour waiting and without any Airline staff explaining the cause of delay or if indeed we were going to travel. They passed to and fro without having the courtesy to explain. My experience in the morning from Mombassa was a joke.",0
Aqaba to Larnaca via Amman. Very bad experience with Royal Jordanian. I had my return flight canceled and I've never get a refund for that. Furthermore had to book another ticket with another company by my own! They never replied to my numerous email asking for help. I've never seen that. I don't recommend the company at all.,0
"I am extremely satisfied with Indigo's service. I was visiting my daughter in USA and had a transit in Delhi via Agartala. I was extremely nervous as I am a senior citizen and my previous booking with Vistara for the same destination was suddenly cancelled. Indigo was extremely courteous and helped me every step of the way. Not only did the staff help in Agartala, Kolkata and Delhi but a young gentleman from their airline stayed and helped me out in Delhi when my flight to USA was delayed. I am forever grateful to this gentleman to provide such service during this pandemic situation.",1
"Spirit was the worst bumpy flight ever I will never fly with this airline it had so many issues, I  wouldn't even let my dog ride on that airline, they had technical problems before we even started to take off. It was just horrible.",0
Flew TLV to SAW return. Short flights were on time and no frills as per the pricing but no surprises either. No free water in Gokcen so we were thirsty on the flight. Bags came promptly and no complaints about the airline. Third party ground staff in Istanbul had weak English but not a major issue. Plane was clean and modern.,1
This had to be the worst flight I have taken. We travelled in Premium Economy. The aircraft was clean and on time but everything else was terrible. The check in personnel in both Los Angeles and Rome were rude. The flight attendants were not much better. They served the inflight meal and returned only to pick up the trays and that was an hour later. They never returned to pick up trash or ask if we needed anything else. The food was poor and inedible. This was my first and last trip on Alitalia.,0
"Hong Kong to Okinawa. We arrived at the airport to check in. Tried checking in online and at the airport kiosk and didn't work, we saw the line was rather long so asked their staff whether we should do anything and both told us to stay in line until they call our destination for last minute boarding. We wait until they finally call Okinawa, followed the staff to the express counter, at which point they told us ""your flight is closed cos you're late"". What's worse is that they tried to pass it off as our fault at the beginning despite us following their instructions. When they did finally rebook us on tomorrow's flight they said ""we normally charge customers to rebook but we'll waive it for you"" as if they were being generous. In the end they rebooked us on tomorrow's early flight and as compensation they upgraded us. Also gave us two food vouchers for the airport, as if airport food is great. I told them I wanted to be compensated for the taxi rides to the airport, lost hotel night, and lost day of car rental but they can't do anything about it.",0
My husband and I just returned from Australia and New Zealand. We have traveled many places but never on Virgin Australia. We took Delta from Atlanta to Los Angeles then Virgin Australia to Sydney Australia and coming back we traveled on Virgin Australia from Auckland New Zealand to Sydney then to Los Angeles then Delta to Atlanta. We were very pleased. Firstly when we entered the plane the stewardess greeted us. Secondly in our seats were a blanket pillow and a gift package with earphones earplug eye pads and an ink pen. This packages was given to us to and from our destinations. On the way from Auckland to Los Angeles we had really bad turbulence but the pilot came on the intercom and informed us that we would have to stay in our seat because of it. This alone was reassuring and informative. The stewardess check quickly to make sure everyone had there seat belt on. The pilot did a great job because it was rough. The steward and stewardess were very friendly and tried to make our 15 hour flight as pleasant as possible.,1
This is a thanks note after my quarantine. My two little babies and I got a wonderful trip from KUL to Guangzhou airport in March. The cabin crew paid  attention on my babies and provide us a nice service. I would praise the ground staff which helped us from the aircraft to the quarantine hotel and assisted us with heavy luggage. No doubt that China Southern Airlines will be the top choice.,1
"The agent provided the worst service on August 21, at Warsaw airport, Tirana Flight LO597. My carry on was overweight. She laughed, invited her coworkers to see the weight and took a picture of our luggage. They laughed at us saying it was the record, and were extremely condescending to us. Very poor service. Flew business from JFK to WAW. Informed Gabriela of my business ticket. She said you are in economy now.  I hope they do better next time.",0
Faro to Bristol. Crew were most welcoming whilst boarding with plenty of smiles and interaction. We had to wait whilst an elderly couple were late due to them going to the wrong Gate they were frail and agitated on boarding. The crew were marvellous with them even the Captain emerged from the cockpit to greet them calming them and telling them not to worry. Despite this we left early and a smooth flight got us into Bristol ahead of schedule. Well done Ryanair!,1
"Manchester to Cayo Coco. The selection of movies, TV shows and music were fantastic, and free drinks. The crew were excellent on both flights extremely helpful. We both received an amenity kit both ways with blankets and pillows. The upgraded meals were delicious. The seat pitch and width were great and the legroom was the best I ever had.  Premium is worth the extra money.",1
"I was travelling with my wife and daughter 3 year old from Birmingham to Alicante via Amsterdam. The flight from BHX was late by more than 2 hours. And I was stranded at the airport with my 3 year old without any help. I called the customer care three times the first two representatives were very rude but got no answer even after 30 min. The ground staff was horrible. They appeared at the gate only after 1 hr and were very unprofessional. The airline could have asked the ground staff to distribute some water bottles to the passengers at least. When I reached at Amsterdam airport, I have to run to the gate with my daughter in the lap for almost 20 minutes because the connection time was less 10 min. Again no help was provided by the ground staff. I was exhausted my back continued to ache for the next 2 days, our daughter was exhausted and my wife was tired. Our first 2 days of holiday in Spain was a complete waste. Also, our baggage was not on the same flight and got it delivered next day at 5 p.m..",0
"Seattle to Amsterdam. I purchased my two tickets months in advance, paying extra for premium economy in the bulkhead seats. One day before my flight, Delta changed our seats so that we are no longer next to each other. They offered no recourse other than accepting less desirable seats in the middle of the plane, and no compensation for giving us a less desirable situation. Overall rating, based on this totally unacceptable change is a 0.",0
"easyJet from Lanzarote to Bristol, one way flight. Inbound plane about three quarters of an hour late, thanks apparently to French ATC trying out a new system and thereby reducing the flights it was handling for the day. Anyway the plane made up some time and arrived Bristol about thirty minutes late. So nothing much to grumble about. Both pilots were chatty, which I like, and the cabin crew got on with their tasks cheerfully. Cabin clean and fresh and a spare seat gave room to spread a little. All in all, a very decent performance by easyJet.",1
"My Dad bought my ticket for October 20th, 2020. My Mom had to go into the hospital on October 13th. I called to move up my departure date. A reservations representative, was able to get my ticket for Thursday, October 15th. He then called me back saying that he could send me even a day earlier, Wednesday, October 14th. He made sure emails were received and confirmed. He was very professional, showed human empathy and interest in my Moms emergency situation. My elderly parents are so grateful and appreciative of his kindness.",1
"Air Canada Rogue is one of the worst if not the worst airline I have flown. I fly at least once a month. I booked my flights with Air Canada but the flights were changed to Rogue without notification. The seats are too small and very uncomfortable. My husband is 6'2"" and he was uncomfortable the whole flight. My elderly mother was almost in tears due to the lack of leg room. There is no entertainment systems. The last flight had only some breakfast items on an evening flight. All passengers were complaining about the lack of leg room. It is torture if the person ahead puts their seat back. I have always been a loyal Air Canada customer but I will be booking WestJet were possible. The flights were so bad I would rather have to change planes than endure another Rogue direct flight.",0
"Ft Lauderdale to Exuma. This was a horrible flight, never again will we use this airline. You put us on a plane, took us off that plane and then delayed our flight for four hours. Bad customer service!",0
SF Vegas LA. Two short but great flights in first class. Light delicious snacks extremely comfortable seats and eager to please staff on the ground and in the air. This is how it should be done up front.,1
LHR to Seoul. A bit put out by checking in at T1 in LHR and the BMI staff could not have been less helpful. Trip was excellent though nice seats with plenty of room food was fine. Easy to collect baggage at Seoul.,1
"Tokyo Narita to Taipei with Scoot. Quick check in. Clean cabin and comfortable seats. On time departure. Premier meal was good. Scoot TV was a hassle to get working. Didn't work on OS9, worked on Samsung tablet. Only 1 free movie per biz seat. Would fly again as was good value.",1
Flight was cancelled. Lady at the counter instructed us to check our email and leave the airport. We tried to rebook our flight through the app which was not working. Calling customer services wait times were over an hour and kept getting different responses. Swoops outsourced those call center and clearly staff wasn't trained. We were then instructed that adjustments can only be made at the airport. We made a second journey to the airport where no staff was available. We are currently stranded with no support from Swoop and have spent a full day trying to rebook. Two journey to the airport and 5 hours on the phone.,0
"Knoxville to Fort Lauderdale. It was delayed due to a worker from the airport dropping jet fuel right outside of the plane. Nothing was wrong with our plane we just had to wait for it to be cleaned up. However, that took almost two hours with no air on a small confined aircraft with over 100 people. Not once did allegiant offer a drink or snack while we waited and the two men sitting next to me were in the wrong seats and the flight attendant acted like it didn't matter. The flight attendants were rude, and not once offered a drink or snack as we all sat there and sweated. Then, once we finally do get to our destination we have to sit there for another 45 min because they can't get the door open! Awful. I've flown with Allegiant multiple times but this flight was terrible. Very disappointed. I don't expect to have tv or free food on your flight, however I do expect to get a free snack if we are delayed that long and flight attendants don't inform you on anything. Neither did our pilot. We sat there for almost an entire hour before the pilot even informed us on what was going on.",0
Our booking request was cancelled with no explanation at the last minute as we were already near airport and we were told to find a new booking. They offered only a money refund and no compensation for accommodation or other flight. And the refund only after 30 days! So how we can book another flight?,0
"Frankfurt to Beijing in Air China business class. The seats are not very different to Lufthansa and while confortable, they are long way below leading airlines and you get no private area from next to you passenger. I did pay cheap fare and guess I shall not complain too much about that. But I was sat next to a customer who spent much of the flight shouting across to a passenger 3 seats away, he kept spitting into the air sickness bag, and I felt quite ill and very tired by the time we got off. I talked to cabin attendants about this and they seemed to find it very funny and said and did nothing. When the meal was cleared away, they did not come into the cabin until 2 hours before landing in Beijing. Because I was kept awake by this man spitting and shouting I tried to watch movies but the selection on Air China is very poor and not suited to Western tastes. Next time I will make sure to choose Lufthansa or an airline where the fellow customers may be more polite and the cabin staff do some work. Never again, such a terrible experience.",0
"They were offering money and hotel for any whom offered to stay until the next day flight. We did not accept as we needed to travel. 30 minutes prior to take off, they bumped us, as we had not boarded by then and closed the flight. Refused to allow us to board and said the ticket office would replace our tickets for the next days flight. My 7 year old daughter was crying as we were denied boarding and the rude gate attendant, whom I regret not taking her name said to her ""this is your parents fault, so don't cry"" I asked to her why the she said that to my daughter and she began to insult me and requested we leave the international terminal.  It took us over 1 hour to get to the other terminal ticket office. The attendant said we had to pay for a 1 way ticket for each passenger as it was our fault for not boarding plane 1 hr prior to take off, and That paying for new tickets were the only option. I will never use Air Europa again and we do not recommend it to anyone.",0
We flew with Monday 15th September flying from Gatwick to Alicante. The plane and cabin staff were excellent. We have travelled with lots of different airlines and rate this as one of the best.,1
"In my opinion Delta airline is the worst I have experienced. I am silver and this is the end of my Delta loyalty. I attempted to hop on an earlier flight several times because I had completed my work in Greensboro early. The lady eagerly said "" are you Gold or Platinum""? I said ""no I am Silver."" She stated it would be 50 dollars to go on standby but she is not going to bother because I am silver. With that I was dismissed with a ""Next"". This is not the first time this has occurred and I travel for business. For validity sake my flight number originally prior to attempting an earlier flight was DL1384 from GSO to ATL.",0
"I was traveling to Bucharest, after checking in and going through the control area, I arrived at the gate that my flight was going to take place.  30 minutes before the flight, they announced that the boarding will start soon. Firstly, it was smooth no problems with anyone even though some people had more than 1 luggage, duty free bags. Towards the end of boarding and approximately 20 people were standing at the queue, a female came to check the last people's tickets to see what ticket they purchased. I have purchased the economy class ticket along with most of my fellows. That lady checked my ticket, and said only one bag is allowed in the plane looking at my other hand while I was holding an extra duty free bag with 2 bottle of spirit that I purchased. And she literally pointed that I had to shove into my bag 2 alcoholic spirits which it was really hard since my bag was smaller than the required size.  I did manage to storeboth in my bag which I was really glad about it. When I reached the ticket check, the same lady stopped me and said ""OK did u manage to fit everything in your luggage'' I replied ""yes thank you"" and she goes ""ok let's check the weight"". It's this moment that you realize the obvious. Yes the luggage was more than 8kg but what you expect after she is the one that told me fit everything in your bag so you can board the aircraft. So I was really angry at that moment and that is why I started yelling. What was the outcome?! I did manage to fit the 2 alcoholic spirits in my bag I had only one bag That bag was more that 8 kg obviously since I had to fit everything She initially said nothing can be done and after a while she changed her mind and charged that bag with an extra 50 euros.",0
Mexico City to Houston. Do not check in your bags. I paid to check in 2 bags and things were stolen. I did not realize it until I got home. I called numerous numerous times and nobody would let me do a report because I had left the airport. They do not care about the customers.,0
"It is a shame that I even have to write this review because this is usually my airline of choice. Before I continue with my review I want to clarify that the flight attendants and pilot were awesome. They made me feel completely at ease and comfortable for the entire flight. However, the plane itself was disgusting. I mean I could not wait to get home and shower bc I felt like I was sitting in pure dirt. The crevasse between my seat was filled with crushed up cheese its. The sealing of the plane and my window had brown marks on them. Lastly, there was some type of particles that kept falling from the air vents all flight. I checked to see the cleanliness of the vents and they were covered in dust. I felt absolutely disgusting and could not fall asleep like I normally would on this quick flight because I was so grossed out. They announced that this flight was thoroughly cleaned right before we entered for ""covid regulations"" but I can tell by the aircraft's condition it was a lie. Not to mention the passengers who were on this plane previously literally disembarked less than 10 minutes ago. There is no way that an airline should allow passengers on an aircraft in that condition. It looked like it hadn't been cleaned in years.",0
"I was left stranded in the airport for 24 hours without any care or concern, nor was any communication about the delay. It was truly a nightmare or the status of the plane, worse experience ever in the decades of my international travels. I was still waiting in the airport as I wrote this report. I will not recommend this airline to anyone especially for this particular route.",0
"Berlin Tegel to London Heathrow. First flight out cancelled at very short notice. Unsympathetic customer service who gave false information about availability of flights during the day, forcing us to rebook on the last flight out and so miss business meetings. Arrived at airport to find last flight out delayed by 30 mins. Very frustrated and disappointed with poor service.",0
"Excellent in all respects. The food is brilliant, best ever had on an airline. Comfy lie flat seats, friendly and attentive cabin crew.",1
"I boarded the flight from New Delhi to Sharjah on 18.01.2023. It was the worst experience I ever had. Not only the flight is poor but the entire staff are rude, unprofessional and uneducated. I think this is the reason they offer low cost flight and save money by hiring unprofessional employees. I believe they are trained for misbehaving with the passenger. Food was served in a manner as if they are doing some favour. I will never board Air India Express flight again and will prefer to spend more money on some good company.",0
"I tried to cancel my flight less than 24 hours after booking. I still haven't received the refund. They are returning less than I paid for the flight. I had to stay on the phone for 1 hour, they changed the operator several times. Extremely rude. Today I called again, and again the operator was very rude. I'm going to have to wait for 30 days for the refund.",0
On our return flight from Orlando to DFW we arrived early to the massive lines at security. Got through and sat down for an early dinner flight delayed. Took our time then another notice flight delayed again. Finally left dinner and walked around got to out terminal flight delayed again. So our 7pm take off was now leaving at 9pm. Sat down and watched TV. Then some people started standing up and getting upset flight now delayed until 11.45pm. Our plane arrived but had to wait on a crew to fly us. Finally got on the plane after midnight and waited another hour on the plane. We were told we might not have enough fuel. Really? The plane had been there at the airport for 3 hours and no one checked to refuel it? Got back to DFW at 2.30am. Only one baggage person there at that time and several bags were missing. 30 minutes waiting to get our bag that came in at an early flight. So 8 hours in the airport and all the explanation we got was it was DFW's fault. Never again.,0
"Flew to Banjul with Titian Airways as part of the Gambia experience from Gatwick on the 8th of March. Had a lovely flight, all the staff were lovely. We returned on the 19th of March but unfortunately we had on board a drunken abusive passenger, the cabin crew handled the situation very professionally and even whilst handling a most difficult situation they still treated all the other passengers brilliantly. The service was brill and all in all a brilliant flight, hats off to Titan Airways.",1
"I have flown a lot but this was my first experience with Alaska Airlines. We flew with our baby. I was very pleased that they were able to give us a row. The seats were the most comfortable coach seats I've sat in. We're both a little tall, my husband is 6'3"", and he had enough room to stretch his legs out in front of him without his knees touching. The food offered was limited but good. The staff was the most friendly staff I've ever encountered flying in 25 years. Our flights were on time. They arrived a bit early at the destination. The best part was the changing table in the bathroom. The prices were the best offered for the trip we shopped for too. I sat on that plane looking forward to leaving a review, they were that good.",1
"Auckland to Christchurch. Flew on this short flight on February 14th. It was a surprisingly spacious aircraft, plenty of leg room, very attentive flight crew and refreshments included. Would highly recommend.",1
"Bangkok to Oslo. Amazing airline with great staff and very good services. From the check in until arrival we were treated in a very good manner by airport staff and also by cabin crew, smiling and full of enthusiasm. New and clean aircraft with comfortable seats and nice inflight entertaiment. Some people were upset because of the luggage but company informed even via sms and email about policy. Well done Norwegian! Really amazed with the great service for a low cost airline!",1
"I had the worst experience with Ryanair customer service. As I was travelling with a six month old daughter, I paid for speedy boarding at Prague airport. The boarding process was a complete chaos, there was no call for speedy boarding customers and eventually we were made to wait in front of the plane in one large queue, holding the baby in my arms in the cold, and I was literally the last person to enter the plane. I complained to the staff on board and they were very apologetic and advised me to request a refund online. I have filed for a refund for the speedy boarding service, waited 4 months for a reply and when it came, it simply read as for our conditions we do not offer refunds. Well thank you for letting me pay for a service I never received.",0
Lisbon to Funchal. Flight was almost empty which although not reflected on the ticket price was a very nice and calm morning journey with very attentive cabin crew and a good sandwich. Thanks for the gentle wake up before landing. TAP product is good with the exception of the odd inconsistency and their absurd expensive flights to and from Madeira.,1
"Santa Marta to Bogota. Really do not fly with this airline, as a regular flyer I can tell you they are so bad and rude from ground staff to cabin, and as others have said charge for everything as extras even tried to charge for my partners hand bag. I end up paying extra to sit with my partner as the computer put us in different seats and told if we changed on the plane we would be charged. As it was, once on the plane everyone moved around to different seats without paying, if you work out the extras its better to fly with Avianca.",0
"My son and I were flying from Vancouver to Hong Kong with Hong Kong Airlines. Everything was going extremely well, until my son's stomach started to hurt and started throwing up. The Cabin Crew were extremely nice and they allowed my son to lie down in business class. One of the Cabin Crew was really nice to my son. They asked if he wanted hot water every hour and also gave him some medicine to reduce pain in his stomach. Overall, I think the Cabin Crew were exceptional and they also arranged him a wheelchair.",1
"The service from this airline is atrocious, my experience with the staff was less than enjoyable. I have taken several flights over the course of my trip through Asia. All of my experiences flying through Bangkok, Phuket and Cambodia the quality of service has been excellent. In Vietnam they have looked for every opportunity to upcharge me and I have been treated with general disdain. I would recommend avoiding this airline if alternatives are available.",0
"Visakhapatnam to Sydney via Singapore. No proper and prior information regarding if we need Negative PCR test report. It's all decided while the boarding passes are given. If no PCR report, you need to reschedule and look for accommodation and bear the charges.",0
Gatwick to Denver. I travelled with my 2 children and the flight was great. The airplane was clean and the Leg room was good. There were plenty of toilets and the staff were attentive and food excellent.,1
"Doha to Amsterdam in Business Class. We were  delighted to enter a new Q Suites cabin with amazing interior and absolute privacy as there was a door to close your seat. Great service from the bottom of the crews heart. We were seated at 3K and 4J and had the best service of our lives from Ms Harman and the Mohammad. Attention to detail, a genuine smile and grooming, were all immaculate. Kudos to the crew for such an unforgettable experience.",1
"My flight was canceled without any explanation. While the communication was fast, we were only given a choice of a ridiculously long layover for the first flight and a two days delayed return flight which was not acceptable. It didn't seem like they actually tried to help us and were not particularly friendly.",0
"Lisbon to Ponta Delgada. Impressive cabin crew, going beyond their duty, professional, kind and attentive. The flight though was tiring and Ryanair needs to stop with this sort of joke of them of landing hardly.",1
"Thank you to the cabin crew flying 20 June. After 2.5 years of COVID ravages, Singapore Airlines still maintains outstanding service and food. Complimentary WiFi worked very well too. It is sad that Book the Cook is now only available from flights out of Singapore, but it is minor. Singapore Airlines is still the best.",1
"3 Hours delay in Brussels due to a thunderstorm, very bad communication. We had to wait in the airplane for almost 3 hours and we received one glass of water. When you fly in economy like we did, you have to pay for everything and the drinks and meals were very expensive. The crew was not friendly. The flight from Malaga to Brussels was a flight without luggage because there was a strike in Brussels. We couldn't check in our luggage so we decided not to fly. We rebooked the flight for free but we had to pay for an extra night in Malaga. I made a complaint and I am still waiting for an answer but they have a very poor customer service. Brussels Airlines is a low cost company with a bad customer service and they have most of the time delays. I would not recommend this airline.",0
"Flew Aeroflot from Moscow to Nizhny Novgorod. New rules for cabin luggage exclude video and photo cameras as well as laptops and books, this is very uncomfortable. The prices are high and the service is like a bad low cost company. Ground staff are watching out for every kilo, backpacks are now limited to 5 kilos which is just ridiculous.",0
Simply the most inhumane airline I have ever run across. I tried to get help at the Barcelona Ryanair ticketing counter. Then went to their ticketing counter in Mallorca and I tried the boarding staff. Every single person was absolutely rude and unhelpful. I watched a man have to put on layers of clothing so he could board the aircraft within their carry on baggage rules. He had nothing and they just watched as he put layer upon layer of clothing. You know as soon as he boarded he would take off the clothes. I am 60 yrs old and travelled all over the world many times and have never seen such disgusting behaviour.,0
Early morning departure from Chennai to Delhi. Boarding process completed before time and on time push back. Clean aircraft with an efficient cabin crew. Landed on time in Delhi. One of the best airlines to fly in India.,1
"Brisbane to Abu Dhabi. Etihad has really gone downhill with quality. Checking in ahead did not work, neither online nor through the app. The app actually recommended to call them 'as soon as possible' but then the automated phone service just referred you back to their website. So this was absolutely useless. The check in was then predictably slow with a long queue. As a result the ground team seemed in a hurry and were neither particularly helpful nor friendly. The seats were horrible. For a 14 hour flight this was remarkable little leg space. Cramped in like in a budget airline. The food wasn't very appetising and while most of the staff seemed professional they didn't go above and beyond to make this a pleasant flight experience. A lot of time for them was spent chatting in the galley. Will definitely not make the mistake of flying with Etihad again. Can't believe they are rated as a 'Five star airline'. Absolutely undeserved and miles off, Etihad is currently closer to a three star airline than a five star one.",0
Sydney to Brisbane. Virgin Australia cancelled the flight without informing the customer earlier. They said the flight was delayed and cancelled the flight when we have arrived. The customer service was very poor and the attitude of them towards the customers was terrible. They just blame all the responsibility to the weather and they do not  understand the customer at all. This is the worst airline ever!,0
"Hong Kong to Toronto. The cabin crew are very friendly but my food was not great. A problem is the toilet I used was dirty before we've taken off. Need more attention inside the cabin, special the chairs and washroom.",0
"New aircraft, looks good. But on board service was very poor. It was a 12 hour flight from Guatemala City to Madrid but they did not supply aminity kits. Even the bathroom didn't have soap or lotions. Crew were very unprofessional with very rude behaviour. It was like a low cost carrier service. Wifi service too expensive. Really bad experience with Iberia. Should to think before flying and compare other long haul airlines service.",0
"This is the worst airline experience I've had in my life. This flight from Philadelphia to New Orleans was cancelled due to weather and I was forced to book another airline at double the price to enjoy my vacation. The alternative was to switch to a flight two days later when I was set to return home. I then find out other flights are flying into the same location 4 hours later. Why cancel the flight for a 4 hour delay? On top of that, I requested the airline to pay the difference in ticket price due to their decision to cancel rather than delay and was told no. I will never be flying Frontier again. A completely poor company with no reassurance.",0
"Worst flight and crew ever. We booked flight from Semarang to Jakarta at 4.30 pm and we try to check in via web a day before. But we couldn't and pop up message show there is an error in our booking. We also try to reach the Customer Service but there is no response. Later on we got the info from our colleague that our flight was moved to another flight which 5 hour earlier than our booking, without notice. We have to rushed our check out from hotel so we could catch up the flight. But what happened later more surprisingly, we got the information that our flight was delayed about an hour. What else, after we board, we knew that our cabin wasn't available because already full with another passenger luggage. And what the crew do? Nothing, they just moved our luggage into baggage without confirmation. This is the last time we used Batik Air and also another airline from Lion Group.",0
Flight from Fort Lauderdale to St Johns with connecting flight in Newark. Left Fort Lauderdale late ran to connecting flight with less than 15 mins to spare flight ended up 4 hours delayed but was never updated online or any departure board. Connecting flight Eventually cancelled because of fog in Newfoundland all though other family members arrived home on Air Canada and Westjet without the fog being an issue. They did give us a toiletry bag to take back to hotel we paid for. No apology but was put on a 6 am flight following morning. Terrible service and flights with no entertainment or compensation.,0
"Gold Coast to Sydney. Worst customer experience ever. The flight was cancelled, promised refund on 28th September 2019 and no refund amount given yet plus got an email today that you can go seek legal advise if needed.  Just there to get money providing pathetic customer support. Will never recommend this airline.",0
"Fort Lauderdale to Toronto. At the start of our journey we were rudely treated at the check in desk over carry on size luggage. We had recently flew Air Canada earlier in the week with the exact same size carry on pieces and now all of the sudden they were too big to travel with. We showed the check in desk lady that clearly it was an airline standardized measurement and that they fit. She gave us a hard time and eventually allowed us to take them on and not have to check them. When we got on the plane, there was more than enough space for the carry on pieces. People were bringing larger bags on than we had. It was outrageous!  Our flight was delayed by 2 hours and we did not even get an email update. The only thing that saved our trip was the kind flight attendant on the aircraft who was very nice and respectful! I would never recommend Air Canada to anyone.",0
"Paris to Valencia. I used Transavia 2 times. First time was just recently from Wien to Paris, which was quite good and normal. Second time I was suppose to fly from Paris to Valencia. I came to airport and I just saw the information that flight was cancelled. What?  I got no email no message. There were no staff from the company on the airport, so nobody to help. On the phone almost nobody speaking english, only french. Even after few minutes of waiting on the phone english speaker did not tell me any important information or how should I proceed. As the next flight is in next week, I cannot wait and I bought ticket via another company on next day, which is little bit expensive. Now I have right to get money back and also much more according to the law, so I am curious what the process of refund will be. Probably very difficult.",0
"Orlando to Dallas Ft Worth. Never have I been on a Frontier airline where they do not delay their flights due to some ""paperwork "" or what one of the captains called and i quote ""a glitched paper"". If you really want to fly with them, take direct flights or else you surely risk missing your connecting flight. This is the messiest airline I have ever used.",0
"Flight was delayed for two hours, when we finally got off the ground I was tired and hoping to sleep through the 1.5hr flight. However, all 5 air hostesses were sat right behind us gossiping loudly. After about 15 minutes I turned around and asked if they could keep the noise down a little, as I was tired and trying to nap after the delayed flight. In response I was met with hostilities, one of the hostesses telling me I'm not in a hotel and shouldn't feel so entitled. I couldn't believe it, and they continued to say nasty things about me and my partner for the rest of the flight. Even when we were leaving the plane they decided to make snarky jokes about my partner to her face. Absolutely no consideration for their customers and even happy to insult their customers in front of them. Customer service is non existent with this company, but if you'd like to be verbally abused throughout the duration of your flight and pay for the privilege, go right ahead. Myself, never ever again, absolutely disgusting.",0
"Flew Frankfurt to Atlanta. Every time I have flown with Delta, I have had problems. Today the plane landed at the terminal on time, but the plane was broken. This 1.5 hour delay made me miss my connecting flight. They came over the announcement and said it was our job to ensure we scheduled our connecting flights when we land because it is out of their control. I have been away from home for 6 months and would like to be able to depend on an airline to get me there.",0
From the start of this flight to the time of landing in Vancouver  Air Canada was professional and pleasant to deal with. One flight attendant was notably great at his job and seemed to genuinely care about passengers and their comfort. Air Canada will definitely get the nod for future travels .,1
Dublin to Toronto. I found the flight fine. There are two problems with this airline lack of leg room and the lack of seat back screens. As I'm not that tall the lack of leg room didn't bother me but can see a problem if you are. I downloaded the app onto my ipad. The films were outdated so wouldn't bother with that. The staff were friendly and professional. The food was nice for airline food. Overall I enjoyed my flight.,1
"I really enjoyed my flight. The flight attendant was so lovely, very friendly and helpful. The flight was a breeze, a bit of a rocky landing, but in all it was a very pleasant experiences. I flew early in the morning, the breakfast snack I had, the sliders were so delicious!! Thank you Airlink, you never disappoint.",1
"Colombo to Bangalore. Service from ground staff and inflight staff was pathetic. While it was a full flight, ground staff behaved rudely asking us, a group of 4, to check in the only cabin baggage less than 55 cm. Spoke real harsh to us when we explained there was a laptop in the bag. Boarded flight disorderly, with two rows on boarding ladder. Preflight, there was no briefing to pax seated in emergency row, allowed elderly person to sit in emergency row, next to exit.",0
Worst experience this time. Bought ticket with my wife but airline decide do not going together because I didn't go to counter. So what is the purpose to check in online also at the airport check in yourself I didn't have any bags to check. It is not the first time. I will consider different company next time.,0
Amazing customer service in Ottawa. Really impressed overall. Paid for extra baggage and found it easy. Super nice people every step of the way. I would definitely fly with them again.,1
We had a flight from Delhi to Pune on Saturday 7th December. We were late and reached 45 minutes before the flight and boarding had started. They told us that the gates were closed but we could see the now boarding on the status screen. We requested them if they can make an exception as it was urgent for us to board the flight but the staff was rude and insensitive. They could have a little more polite and I feel that we could have easily boarded the flight as there was time.,0
"Tampa to Atlanta. This was a Terrible experience from start to finish. My flight was delayed 4hrs due to not having a pilot to bring our plane to Tampa.  They ended up canceling the flight at 1130pm. Since they cancelled the flight so late we ended up not being able to book another flight for that night and subsequently I missed an very important meeting. After arguing and pleading my case I was advised that I would be credited a voucher. Now that I need to use the voucher I am told that it expired and I am out of luck. This is an example of terrible customer service and I will never fly Spirit again. Sad to say I would rather fly Allegiant then deal with this companie's false promises, terrible customer service, and overall lack of professionalism!",0
"Do not waste your time and your money with Eurowings. They cancel their flights and they keep travellers payments. So you do not only lose Eurowings tickets but connecting flights as well. Eventually you pay more to travel with more reliable airlines. Eurowings is not a cheap option, it is a sure way to lose money.",0
"Worst travel experience. We never made it to our destination via plane. We ended up having to drive ourselves. The United staff at the San Francisco airport were rude. Called security on me for removing my mask to speak to her since she could not understand me, as employees of the airport walked around mask less through out the airport. We had to change flight after flight after flight with no success from United. I do not recommend United unless you like being stuck in the airport for days on end.",0
It's 8th days since I hand my family 6 baggages to Austrian Airlines and missing since then. I have been calling every day but they are not willing to provide update. This is the worst airline experience I have had. Austrian Airlines where's our baggage? We have the right to know.,0
"London Heathrow to St Louis via Chicago with American Airlines. The flight was awesome with the attendants all performing their jobs wonderfully. The food was very good as well with, considering it was breakfast, very well sized portions. Even though it is an older product, the flight was very comfortable indeed.",1
"Krabi to Bangkok. Our family flew this airline March 25, 2019. After travelling 2 different countries and numerous flights for 3 weeks with no problem, our encounter at Thai Lion Air was horrible. I am not a person to write reviews but I have realized how important they are for others who might need advice before making a choice. Do yourself a favour and pay a few extra dollars to fly with someone else. This airline will absolutely gauge you at the checkout demanding you pay for baggage you are carrying on at ridiculous prices. Not only was it despicable, but the ticket agent began to yell at us when we started to question this! We have been traveling for 3 weeks with carry on only and have not had one problem yet. Not one! The amount they wanted to charge us for carryon backpacks was double our plane ticket! Completely ridiculous. Also very stressful as their only option was to pay or miss your flight. Horrible practices, horrible customer service. Do not use this airline. Save yourself the stress.",0
No inflight entertainment cramped seating arrangement for long haul flight from Auckland to Bali via Brisbane. Staff were very average the only good thing I have to say with travelling Virgin Australia was that the food and beverages on offer were decent.,0
Nice to Paris CDG. This short flight was to Paris CDG. I was concerned as according to schedule I only had one hour and five minutes to catch my connecting flight to Dublin. However the flight actually arrived 20 minutes ahead of schedule and I even had time to visit the Air France lounge in CDG. It was a pleasant surprise that the chief steward addressed me by name! The service was impeccable and a small collation offered. The cabin crew handled the situation extremely well when people were getting on board with more hand luggage and stuff than they should. Surely management could address this? The crew already have a difficult job without having to deal with passengers who whinge when there is no place in the cabin for their stuff!,1
After losing my luggage which had my suit for my mom's wedding for three days I was told to go buy clothes which I did. They have never reimbursed me. Such a bad airline.,0
"I guess you really do get what you pay for! They are disorganized, long check in wait times, they have no regard for time, they are delayed without giving explanation and are often rude rather than apologetic!",0
Worst airline I have ever flown and will never fly again with TAG Airlines. No office at airport and no attendants to help. Delayed at least 2hrs and had to stand at counter to wait for their attendants to show up.,0
"I travelled  from Mytilini to Athens and it was one of the best flights I Have had, with a smooth landing. The seats were comfortable enough. Food was served, even though the flight was only 45 minutes. Aegean Airlines manages to provide better services than other bigger airlines even in shorter routes. Definitely deserves 4 stars.",1
"Las Vegas to London. I was cautious about booking an almost 10 hour flight with Norwegian based on the numerous negative reviews on this forum. As it turns out they were amazing. Although no online checkin is available when departing Las Vegas, the process at the airport was extremely quick, professional and friendly. Boarding was handled very efficiently and we ended up leaving the gate 12 minutes early. On board, the crew were attentive and professional and very well groomed. Entertainment by way of free PTV was a welcome bonus and the moving map option a nice touch. I would have no hesitation flying thus airline again. I was in economy and it was a very comfortable flight.",1
"My teenage son and I flew Qantas from Sydney to Los Angeles then onto New York on the 1st January. As a special treat, I used my points for an upgrade to Business Class. The experience was very good. In the past I have flown Business with Emirates and Qantas and this flight lived up to their reputation. Business Class in the A380 has lots of room and many comforts. The service was friendly and attentive, the food excellent and the flat bed very comfortable. This was an overnight flight and we slept well. We appreciated the Qantas comfortable pyjamas but I thought it a little odd that both the men's and women's amenities bags had exactly the same contents, only the exterior of the bag was different. In the past my husband had shaving items in his, whilst I had moisturiser and hand cream. Overall, this was an excellent experience and definitely one I would recommend.",1
What should have been a direct flight got changed at the last second to a lay over. So what should have been an hour and half lasted 6 hours instead. My flight was somehow changed at the last second so I couldn't get a chance to try and get my original flight back which wasn't even cancelled so I'm not sure why it was changed on me. So in the future I'm avoiding AA at all costs.,0
Flew on 29th 0ctober once again from CDG to JNB. Beside that by now we all know what a great design this A380 is and how much more peaceful it is inside this airplane when flying. The reason for my comment this time is the very noticeable improvement by AF crew and AF catering to put in an effort to take better care of passengers. AF crew are usually always very polite they seem to enjoy their jobs again. Catering has improved again and food quality is very close to what I remembered it was so many years ago and one of the reasons I became a regular customer of AF. Also noticeable is the new design of cutlery even if made from plastic using them makes it much easier to enjoy the food. Well done AF now just improve the snacks served between meals on this route and it will be perfect.,1
"Palm springs to Grand rapids via Denver. So after finally being deplaned because of maintenance problems, I have been re routed to a flight that takes off two hours later, has a four hour layover at my next stop and gets me home after midnight. I've been dropped from first class to economy. And when I asked if there was any sort of compensation for this mess they have created, I was told I can call customer services. I asked to be put on a different airline so I could arrive home sooner as I have to be in the OR at 7 am tomorrow and was told I couldn't. It is unbelievable how you are treated as a paying customer. Why would anyone ever fly?  When asked why they couldn't have figured out these maintenance problems last night we were told that they don't check the plane until shortly before take off.  It's unbelievable!",0
"Durban to Cape Town. I had the best flight with my 3 kids. Best staff. Was assisted by staff who went out of their way to make sure that our experience was the best. They really are an asset to the company. Everything went smoothly, on time and well organised.",1
Helsinki to Malaga. We were given wrong information about my baby pushchair. They didn't allow me to take it to the gate but I read on internet that it is allowed. We went to the airport the day before travelling to ask this question and they said that yes we can take the pushchair to the gate. The airport agents at Helsinki Airport addressed me rudely and impolite at baggage drop off.,0
"The worst airline ever. Think twice before you book a flight with them. My round trip has been a nightmare. In my first flight to Peru my luggage was broken and 2 pairs of sneakers were stolen. I filed the claim in the airport and the person in charge corroborated the damage. but then when I called the airline they requested multiple thing such as a police statement, the statement of a luggage shop that can confirm that the luggage was broken and other details.",0
"Horrible to say the least! My first experience was not one to remember. San Francisco to Auckland on an old plane with ripped seats flight 7 seat A40. The entertainment system was broken in my seat nice job for 12 hours watching nothing with no seats to move to. Once I arrived to Auckland found out not only was my first trip cancelled to Palmerston North but they cancelled it again for the second time each time having to retrieve my luggage and go through the process all over. Then to add insult to the situation they put me on my third flight now 6 hours after when I was supposed to fly and there was a flight which left in between this time frame and I wasn't put on that because it was ""oversold"". My advice don't fly them.",0
Haikou to Wuhan return on the same day. I have my seat allocated to the first economy row and my preferred seat. The cabin service is on a very high standard under the operation of Cabin Purser. I was offered very delicious food and drinks on the flights.  I would like to praise the English skill of Cabin Purser this time.  Thank you Hainan Airlines.,1
"I booked a trip to Guatemala for my boyfriend and me months ago. When i booked the flight I carefully chose our seat assignments because my boyfriend has back issues. Two days before our flight, I went on the American Airlines website to make sure our flight status was good. Once on the site, I saw that our seat assignments had disappeared. Panicked, I clicked to see what was left and there is nothing, one middle seat in the back of the plane. I carefully chose a seat with leg room in the aisle for my boyfriend because he will need to get up frequently. I called American airlines and waited on hold for 90 mins on a workday two days before my trip. They never gave a time estimate for hold or an option for a call back. I finally reached a representative who told me that an agent had made a change in the flight and had failed to reassign the seats I'd chosen. I asked why no one emailed me, the representative claimed American had sent an email to my boyfriend....that made no sense. I booked the flights, I had all of the confirmations and ticket info. I demanded to be given seats at no additional cost. The representative asked me to wait on hold, then disconnected me. Unlike other airlines, the representative had not asked for my contact information should we be disconnected. She likely did it on purpose because she didn't want to deal with American Airlines mistake. I am not on hold for my second hour when I have a million things to do to prepare for this trip. NEVER FLYING WITH THEM AGAIN.",0
"Terrible, very bad customer service. Extremely unfriendly staff, unclean aircraft, horrendous food. Nor worth the money, simply do not travel with this airline. I don't know how can they still be in the market, have the impression even Ryanair is better and friendlier. This is the type of airline who make you feel so unwelcome and uncomfortable that just by flying with them your holiday is ruined.",0
"Chicago to New York JFK. Delta continually lets me down. This is not my first encounter with them , but surely this is the last. Their workers are not very helpful and very dismissive. They mistakenly put my bag on a flight 4 hrs behind me when I have another to catch.",0
I'm with Helen Brade. Was also on the 15th January flight with the 18 hrs delay. If I had known the real reason for the delay engine fire on outbound flight flight I wouldn't have flown with them at all. The planes are old noisy the reading lights don't work the TV screens are fuzzy and they should stay on the ground for good before a real disaster occurs. The crew are lovely but I didn't feel at all confident that they would be able to handle an emergency situation or one such as the drunk passenger described in Helen's posting. I was on the plane for a total of 17 hrs on the return flight on 12th Feb and this was a day early than scheduled as Phuket said 13th Feb flight cancelled when I called to reconfirm flight no explanation so I lost a day at the start of my holiday and a day at the end I won't be flying with them again. I flew to Bangkok from Laos a few days before my return flight and there were 5 Phuket Jumbos on the tarmac at Bangkok 3 with the engine covers open maybe routine but with all the information on this forum  it does make you wonder. I hope that they can sort out their problems but short of a new fleet I can't see it happening!,0
"I will never ever fly with Spirit Airlines again. They were several hours late on both our flights, wrecking our plans and causing additional hotel stays. I literally got told by them ""We don't care. Do you want a refund or not?"" What seemed like a cheap deal just ended up an overpriced cattle hauler when you add all the basics to it and really expensive when you add their consistent delays. This is the second time I have made the mistake of attempting to travel with them and never ever again. Consistently late, consistently rude and consistently disgusting. Please do yourself a favor and spend the little extra and book on a proper airline.",0
My flights to and from Tenerife were on time. There was a great selection of food and drink to purchase. The cabin crew were friendly and visible on both flights.,1
"This airline was by far the worst experience I've had with any business. To set the record straight, we didn't actually fly with them, we were scheduled to fly back from Leon Mexico to LAX in June but in May they called and cancelled our flight, They offered a flight alternative that would have taken over 12 hours to get home at nearly 1.00 am in the morning, We are seniors and I knew my husband wasn't up to this schedule so I requested a refund. After about 15 minutes of discussion, they finally agreed. Well here it is almost September and I still haven't received my money. I've called five times, three of them being on hold for over one hour and sent countless emails and they make promises but don't deliver. I've had to send my banking information twice so I know that's not the problem. Please travelers do yourself a favor and read their reviews before you book, I sure wish I had!",0
"Cathay seem to be having issues with punctuality. Flew them in the week of 18 June from Singapore to Seoul and they were late three out of four flights. The last leg, they were 3 hours late arriving into Singapore at 315am instead of midnight. Will definitely try my best to avoid them in future.",0
"My flight from Boston to Heathrow arrived in time, but I and other passengers were not allowed to disembark the plane. We were kept in the tarmac for one hour and a half without being given sufficient information about what was causing this delay. Because of this delay, I and other passengers lost the connecting flight to Tirana. I was offered another connecting flight which was 8 hours later from the time of arrival. When I booked this flight, one of the main reasons that made me choose it was the fact that the layover was a little bit more than an hour. Turning it into an 8 hour layover I think is unacceptable and very poor customer service. It shows lack of respect for your clients and lack of commitment by this company to provide to their customers what they were promised and what they paid for. I am very disappointed by this experience.",0
We flew from Seattle to Las Vegas with a connection in Portland as a direct flight would have meant hanging around too long. As we live in UK we were nervous that flights would be delayed given some negative reviews here. Everything went smoothly and right on time. We were impressed with complimentary drinks service given that similar budget airlines in the UK all charge for drinks. Our return flight direct to Seattle was again on time . We found baggage check in quick and friendly and with the exception of one rather curt stewardess everyone else was absolutely fine.,1
"Ranchi to Delhi. I have booked flight with Goair, while doing web check in, after typing PNR and last name on the next page it was shown as that ""all flights have been cancelled "" then I called the customer care service and their they told me that I myself cancelled the booking, but how this is possible? And the customer care guy is telling my name that I have cancelled the flight and later he told that the flight is cancelled through web. If someone cancelled the flight through web then how did he know the name of person who cancel. Very bad experience with Goair and now it's difficult to get my money back.",0
"Fort Myers to Austin via Houston. I am mortally sick of this airline. I really cannot think of anything good to say about them. Today is the third time in a row they have both been delayed by an hour or more, and forced me to check my bag, even though when I get on board, there is plenty of bin space available costing me 30 minutes on the other end of my flight, on top of the delays. Do they really have so little comprehension of bin space or communication between on plane and terminal staff? I don't have this problem with Southwest, Virgin, Delta, Alaska, just United. Honestly if I had a choice, I would use any other airline. So I guess routes is the other thing we have to give them credit for.",0
Jaipur to Kolkata via Guwahati. It was an excellent experience. Flight crew were very supportive and inflight service was excellent.,1
Detroit to Dallas. They suck in every way. Service suck. Policies suck. Prices suck. Never fly American Airlines. I have been sitting here delayed traped on a cramped airplane for 45 minutes. They just keep telling me lies about some bag they need to get. I just went to my grandpa's funeral and I have finals tomorrow. I am unbelievably upset. They can't even tell me the real reason we are going nowhere. I will never fly with American Airlines again. I wish I could give them a big fat 0!,0
"London Luton to Athens. I booked mine and my girlfriends tickets at the same time, I also understood the risk that Ryanair may sit us apart however, when my girlfriend and I are sat 11 rows apart yet both of us have vacant seats next to us. Ryanair you are absolutely abysmal. You are forcing people to pay premiums to chose seats by intentionally sitting them apart. Your price difference is not that much lower that you can do that without people opting not to fly with you. From now on I shall not be using your service again.

Delhi to Dubai via Muscat. Some passengers were not allowed to board and they mentioned that apparently the UAE government had issued a new rule saying that a minor difference in the place of birth between the visa and the passport. And even though the passport number matched with the visa we were denied boarding. We were able to fly with the same visa on he next day via flyDubai  without any issue.,0
Skiathos to London Gatwick. The flight was more than 8 hours late in arriving. Apparently this is a common experience with Small Planet Airlines and they have subsequently refused to respond to our claim for compensation for the additional expenses we incurred as a result. Otherwise the cabin was comfortable and the crew perfectly pleasant,0
Outbound Journey 3rd Sep from Birmingham Airport to Tenerife South and Return Journey Friday 13th Sep. Could not fault it from start to finish brilliant service cabin crew were exceptionally pleasant and very friendly seating arrangement were fantastic comfortable seats and seemed to be more leg room. All in all a fabulous airline also no hassle with the weight of luggage. Would highly recommend and definitely travel with Monarch again.,1
"Got a lovely email at 5 in the morning the day of my flight saying that my original connection had been canceled and I would have to rebook. While I understand things happen it is a little absurd to cancel a flight that day of, give some people some leeway to figure out what other travel arrangements they could make. By the time I checked my email it was impossible to catch half of the options they gave me for rebooking. Beyond the cancelation American is average at best, they're your typical seats and typical flight crew although I would say the plane was a little dirtier than average. On my flight out here the plane was supposed to have wifi, part of the reason I booked that flight so I could get some work done, but lo and behold when we hit cruising altitude the wifi was not working. American did make sure to promote their new credit card to a captive audience while we were on the plane though. I'll be avoiding this airline at all costs in the future.",0
"My return Fiji Airways flight from Los Angeles to Nadi was much better than the last. The inflight entertainment had improved and there were more movies, even Chinese ones. Except the Hindi songs, there is a need for new songs not from movies which released years ago. The food was good, chicken curry was delicious and filling for the 11 hours flight ahead. Looking forward to flying Fiji Airways in future again.",1
"I booked a trip with Hong Kong Airlines in March 2019 for travel in December 2019. I booked it this far in advance so that I get decent prices on the flights. My flights were confirmed by Hong Kong Airlines and I booked the hotels at my destination. One month after I booked the trip, Hong Kong Airlines contacted me to let me know that the airline had cancelled our departure flight and that they were bumping us out by one day. Then 3 months prior to departure, Hong Kong Airlines contacted me again to let me know that the airline had now cancelled our return flight and they would be bumping us out by one day for our return flight. I contacted my travel agent to let them know that this was not acceptable as it would cost me more money again to book a hotel for the extra day. After spending hours and days on this, nobody at my travel agency or Hong Kong Airlines was able to assist me. At the end, they offered me a refund. I let them know that the reason I had booked my flights 9 months in advance is because I wanted to ensure that I get decent prices on my flights. Giving me a refund 3 months prior to departure is not going to help me find similar flights on the dates that I needed them on.",0
"I was supposed to be flying from Glasgow to Stornaway today with another 8 family members, we were going to a family wedding on the Isle of Harris. Due to Corona virus the wedding, hotel and flight were cancelled. When i tried to get a refund from Loganair they would not give me a refund only the offer of flights valid for 1 year? With people's commitments it would be very difficult to get together again with work and other commitments, they are just saying you can go when ever you wish the whole point was to go together for this great occasion? Absolutely sick about the outcome and the expense.",0
"I will go out of my way not to use flydubai again. The leg room is very poor, and no free services. If you like to pay for drinks or food then this is your airline. No free on board entertainment. They have duty free if you want.  The flight attendants spent more time chatting among themselves and tending to their luggage then the passengers who pay their salaries. This is a cheap no frills airline!",0
"I travelled Cochin to Chennai. One of the best parts of flying in Indigo is the timing, always on time. The cabin crews was well trained and pleasant,  I truly like the ambience and the behaviour of the cabin crew. All i want to say is try Indigo airline and you will feel the difference.",1
Barcelona to Amsterdam early morning flight. Seat pitch it is ok if you are under 6 foot friendly crew. English announcements professional and the buy on board drink prices no more expensive than the airport. You need to pay for luggage and selecting a seat but the website was easy to use and baggage drop quick.,1
Nice looking business class product lovely crew. But the business class seat is too hard and its hard to sleep on. The food was also quite bad not enough and like economy like. Not choosing and spending this money again for such a product. For this route a prefer Thai airways! Was really disappointed with Finnair business class product. Bring your own food and a mattress on their flights haha,0
"Lisbon to Athens. One more time with Aegean! Excellent as always, on time, crew friendly and approachable, hot meal and drinks for free, clean aircraft. Don't know if you need more from an airline if you fly in Europe",1
"I had booked for flying Jet Airways flight 468, Chennai to Mumbai, which was scheduled to flyout at 18.10 hours. When I reached the airport and took the boarding pass, we were told that it was on time. While at the lounge, it was rescheduled to 18.25 and later to 19.15 hours. Later, there was no announcement and the next flight which was to leave at 19.30 hours was called up, people started making enquiries about the earlier flight. What we were told was the flight 9W468, was on time, but got diverted to Delhi and many smart people who got wind of this, got themselves booked on the next flight, but the hapless guys like us in the lounge who were unaware did not do so. When queried repeatedly, they told us that both the flights will leave almost at the same time. When I went to the gate, I saw that the boarding had just commenced for our flight, whereas for the later one, the gate was closed as boarding had got completed. The trouble did not end there. After we boarded the flight, it was extremely cold and when we asked for blankets, the hostess told rudely that they have run out of stock and we have to manage. The head stewardess admitted that they carried only 12 blankets and as soon as it ran out, they could not accommodate others. ",0
"Charlotte to London Heathrow. I was so disappointed in my experience with American Airlines. I just returned from a flight on Delta and it was a far and away better experience than with AA. The difference was night and day. On both my flights to and from London, the crew never cracked a smile, never had a welcoming word, never answered a request for service with an agreeable attitude. They obviously didn't want to be dealing with the customers and were, at times, even sarcastic to their passengers. My touch screen didn't work but I didn't dare ask the attendants for assistance and get a snarky answer. The food was marginal, at best, but it was the attitude of the crew that spoiled the travel. The gate crew on Charlotte even mocked the passengers from the preceding flight within hearing of the waiting passengers. No wonder my flights were not full. Unless I have to choose American Airlines in the future, I will be flying anyone else. They got us there safely, but that was the extent of the service.",0
"Sydney to Brisbane. So there's a ""Move Me"" option that allows a passenger if they arrive early or arrive late for their flight to make the necessary changes without a fee but that most certainly wasn't the case with us. So we called the customer service for help and clarification but they couldn't provide any useful information and said the airport has its own policies. I said Ok then surely someone knows like a manager and so when I asked to be connected to the manager, the customer service representative wouldn't connect me and kept saying the same thing over and over. The same answer I'm giving you is the same answer my manager is going to say to you. The first time to Australia, it makes it a terrible first impression!",0
The crew were very enthusiastic and helpful. The service was very fast and we were served a drink and a snack. For such a short flight it was great. I would recommend.,1
Frankfurt to Bombay via Bangalore. The worst flight experience. Both flights delayed. The baggage arrived super late and the second flight boarded us which is already late by 2 hours. Very irritated except for the extra baggage because of which we booked this flight nothing is even near to good. Please don't make a mistake of booking this airline specially for international trips!,0
I booked a connecting flight from Manila to Tacloban few weeks ago then Airasia cancelled and rebook my flight 1hr after my arrival from international flight. Then when I tried to re book the customer service is doesnt want to entertain my issue. I had no choice but to rebook it the next flight. I have waited 9 hrs at Manila then 2 hrs before the scheduled departure they announce again there will be delay of flight.,0
"Pegasus Airlines from Madrid to Dubai. I recommend using any other airline. We arrive at the airport in Madrid over 2 hours early, and the line to check bags was so long and slow and took over an hour. It took so long we almost missed our flight. Then we get to the gate and they stop us and make me check my carry on with no reasoning. Speaking in Spanish and pointing and then asking for my return flight information. The seats on the plane were so small my knees were touching the seat in front of me and I'm not even tall. Then we get to our final destination in Dubai and they lost my luggage. Then went to the lost baggage counter they said this happens with Pegasus all the time. ",0
"By far one of the worst experiences I have had flying out of the country. They were supposed to take me from JFK to Lagos and then to Liberia, it almost seems impossible for them. After a 12 hours layover in New York, when it came time to board, they were late checking their passengers in and then when we got to gate we sat there for another 4 hrs before they told us to line up for boarding. We waited another hour and they proceed to tell us that the flight was going to be delayed for an hour, 45 mins later we were told they were having technical issues that could last for hours. If you ever going to west Africa, Arik Air is not the airline.",0
"Flew Air France on this route for a quick business trip to the Dominican Republic. Flights were on time, and baggage was swiftly delivered at both ends of the journey. The staff were first rate, courteous and helpful on all 4 flights. Food was tasty, if a little small in portion size. Champagne is available as an aperitif, and cognac served after dinner as a digestif. Flights were nearly full, but the service was efficient and hospitable. My only grumble is the seat design in Premium Economy, which slides forward but only pushes you forward. Not good and makes for backache after such a long overnight journey. But, I continue to be impressed with AF on short and long haul routes.",1
"Singapore to Trivandrum. I missed my Scoot flight to Trivandrum. I opted a wheelchair as I had physical issues. A lady assistant who took me from the Singapore airlines informed that my flight was delayed and that I'll be taken to the correct gate later. I waited for someone to guide me. As no one came to assist me for a long time, I enquired and realized that my flight was on time and I had missed the flight. I spend 24hrs in the airport. They accommodation they gave was available only for few hours. They provided me meal vouchers and next day's flight ticket. I regret booking this trip. I had to call both the airlines back and forth for all my clarifications, which was very frustrating.",0
"Dusseldorf to Istanbul via Seychelles. I've now flown 4 times with Turkish Airlines, all times were terrible. Unfriendly staff, some don't even speak English properly. I was flying alone with my baby and also being pregnant, no extra help was offered. When flying during the night, they start serving dinner at midnight, lights are on bright, people trying to sleep with blankets over their heads. I asked several times if they could dim the light. When pressing the flight attendant button, nobody comes. Terrible service! The meals are also horrible. Cheap, tasteless, unhealthy food. They are trying to be like Emirates but they obviously can't compete.",0
"Zurich to Brussels, worst nightmare ever. Flight LX788 cancelled. No information why. Had to rebook with 400 other passengers. 2 desks open. No movement for multiple hours. Rebooked to 1 day later at 21.00. Where to stay? No information. Rented a car and drove back home. Luggage still lost. Never again Swiss.",0
"Dubai to Vienna via Amman. I would not recommend to use this airline. The flight was delayed for 5 hours and not the first time it happens to me with this airline. Nobody can't give a proper answer why and weather the delayed time is fixed, moreover I needed to go further in Graz and I lost my ticket to there. The company doesn't want to cover it and didn't even apologized or tried to help me somehow so I spent double amount of money for that. Plus the stuff in the Amman's airport is absolutely unfriendly. It's a really bad experience, please don't reply on the ""Royalty"" of the company.",0
"Customer service is the worst I have ever experienced relative to other airlines. Their ""live chat"" is worthless and its near impossible to rebook a ticket. You can't do it yourself if it involves more than one city which is absurd. Changing a ticket booking because the airline canceled flight is a basic level of service that I should be able to do from my phone. If you are going to force me to have a representative to rebook my ticket then provide representatives that are available! I spent days waiting on phone lines and ""Live Chat"" rooms for such a simple task. If the tickets weren't so overpriced, I would of dumped the money and rebooked with another airline. I have no issues with the actual planes, flight attendants or workers of Hawaiian airlines but the company needs serious restructuring of its customer facing services.",0
"Phuket to Kuala Lumpur. I tried to pay for baggage online. They did not allow to make payment after putting pnr number I have used my mobile as I did or have laptop or PC Then I called them to pay for 60kg for 4 person, they said 15kg per person is included to check in. I was 3.5 hours before my flight at airport they said you have to pay for luggage and the cost is 400 baht per kg per flight.",0
Armidale to Sydney. A great country airline. Genuine customer service and hospitality. The whole experience was fantastic. The online booking was easy. The check in procedure was great. Onboard the solo flight attendant was exceptional. The catering was excellent. Comfort and safety outstanding.,1
"Bogota to Santa Cruz via Lima. I checked in at Bogota El Dorado airport 3 hours before my flight to Santa Cruz Bolivia, via Lima on 8th April, Avianca officials prevented me boarding the flight as they said I was not in possession of a yellow fever certificate which was mandatory for Bolivia. I was not asked for proof of vaccination at check in. When I was prevented from boarding the aircraft I was also told that my bag had not been loaded so Avianca staff had obviously been aware of the situation for some time, but no one had contacted me while I had been in the lounge for three hours to advise me of the situation, if they had I could have obtained the vaccination at El Dorado airport during this time. Avianca made me pay to rebook my flight and I had to pay for a hotel before resuming my travel to Santa Cruz Bolivia the next day where on arrival I was told that a yellow fever vaccination was not required! I tried to speak to the duty manager for Avianca on the evening of the 8th April to ask that Avianca contribute to the rebooking and hotel but he sent a message through ground staff that he was too busy to bother with my problem.",0
Flew economy class from Los Angeles to Melbourne return. Qantas were outstanding and earned my vote as one of the best airlines. Service on both sectors was excellent. The entertainment options were varied and extensive enough to occupy 15 hours of flying. The seat was far more comfortable than other long haul airlines I've flown and the food above the standard economy fare. The A380 is also an amazing aircraft to fly on.,1
Kuala Lumpur to Sydney in Economy Extra Leg Room. My TV Screen would just drop down every now and then. My wife Headset had a loud crackle and static. I ordered a Gluten Free meal. I received Fish that was was dry. I don't expect good food on an aircraft but this was the worst meal that I have ever been served.  I received a snack about 2 hours before landing. I asked for a glass of water that was served from a jug and the water was warm. The aircraft was far from clean. We used wipes to clean the arm rests and the wipes ended up far from white.  I will go back to Malaysia but I would rather go via a connection with another airline than directly with MAS and I'm sorry for all the good people that work for Malaysian.,0
"Flew with Norwegian last year to Greece and was pleasantly surprised with this supposedly low cost airline. I had never heard of Norwegian before, I booked to fly this year to Los Angeles and was amazed by the comfort of the plane and the free inflight entertainment. We would definitely recommend to anyone to fly Norwegian and we can't wait to book another trip with them. There was nothing low budget about them. Yes you have to pay for those extras but then you pay in the long run if you fly with the larger airlines and you also pay a larger price for your flight to begin with.",1
"Houston to Denver. Standing in line to check bags in and there is no one else in lane. This is at 4.15am. I walk up to check bags in and there are three people behind the counter just talking. So I approach the counter and the staff member rudely tells me, ""well since you are already here I guess I can help you."" My daugher then says, ""she was a little rude."" Yep Frontier Airlines at its best. This is by far the worst airline! If you can avoid flying them please do.",0
"Havana to Madrid. On the 9 hour flight nothing to do, no tv screens, nothing. No phone charger. Plane was very dirty with front seat pocket hanging off. Staff not very friendly.",0
"I'm very pleased with airport ground handling, they are very helpful, and polite, informed me about business class upgrades, although there's no more seats available they still added my number and keeps me informed if any seats becomes available. I almost gave up waiting for the class upgrade but before I enter security check, they called letting me know there is a seat becomes available, so I immediately took that spot, paid for my upgrade and slept through my entire trip.",1
Southend to Dublin. Excellent airport new route from May. Aircraft was nice clean ART42 nice leather seats which had plenty of legroom for the 1 hr 35 minute flight. Excellent inflight with smiling hostess.,1
Melbourne to Bangkok via Brunei. Both sectors departed and arrived on time. Both aircraft clean and comfortable. Very good service from flight attendants. Only 4 in Business Class so almost one to one service. No alcohol served but BYO not a problem in moderation. Excellent English from Cabin Crew. No priority passes for immigration in Bangkok. Excellent value for money.,1
Orlando to San Francisco. Service was very bad and aircrafts was very dirty. Due to some delays on another airline I was rebooked to return back to Tampa same day. I did not make that flight because of the incompetence of the ground staff in San Francisco. Very rude and did not really care to listen. Same day inbound flight horrible aircraft outbound could not even make it because of United staff. 25 years of flying over 200.000 miles per year. Never seen an airline this bad.,0
4 flights in 3 days not a single one of they was on time. 3 were delayed for maintenance. I will never fly this airline again.,0
"Delta is the worst airlines for the family travel. I am not going to fly with Delta again. Delayed 3 times almost every hour at the last minutes. Missed our connecting flight. They put out family members in four different places even though we purchased our ticket months ago. Bye bye Delta, you will not get my business again.",0
Delhi to Kochi. Food facility and air hostess service are very helpful. They provide every required needs With very sensitive manner.,1
"Worse experience in booking a flight I have ever had.  They required me to call. Was put on hold. Booked the flight after a half hour. They made a mistake refunded my flight payment for no reason and I had to spend a hour on the phone with a person who ended up not helping and making a ref number instead of helping. Bought a new ticket for the same flight and got a email confirmation, but then I couldn't pay for a bag because the booking number didn't have the ability to remember my email despite sending me a email on it.",0
"I booked my ticket called the number online to clarify luggage would be included, was told several times both my cases would be included at no extra charge. I flew out of San Francisco August 15th 2021. I was charged 150.00 for my 2nd luggage. I had a layover in Lisbon Portugal. The flight was late, I had 45 minutes to check in to my connecting flight. I was told to go to a website online, to fill out a locator form. My phone would not work in Portugal but was told to figure it out or I won't be able to board, I asked for a paper form and was told no. I finally got on the wifi with no help, filled out the form with no help when I asked questions. I had to pay 150.00 to order Covid tests to be mailed to me to do the at home tests because I didn't know which locations were close or what the hours were for tests. I was done with form 15 minutes prior to departure and told I wasn't getting on the flight as they had already closed the door. I was sent out of the terminal across the airport to customer service.  I got to the line and waited for 3 hours and 40 minutes standing with no way of getting water or a chair, at this point my foot was swollen in my shoe. I asked the gentleman ahead of me to watch my luggage while I went to the restroom. I could barely put weight on my foot and was told I would lose my place in line if I left again. I got my new flight information and then had to go to a counter to get checked in, get a boarding pass and go through security. I was told my luggage had been transferred to the flight.  When I finally made it back through the airport to my terminal to the gate I had to really push myself to stay on my feet. I was asked to do a new locator form and paid for yet another Covid test to be mailed to me. I got on another uncomfortable flight to Heathrow. When I went to baggage claim, my luggage was not there, they looked up my ticket and explained that Tap Portugal had not sent the luggage. I filled out the paperwork to have my luggage delivered to my address in UK. I called the next day to be told TAP still had not sent my luggage.  I waited for my luggage, called next day no luggage.  I called the airline to see what was needed and how to register my covid test for them for my return back to US. They said to follow instructions and it will be OK. Be 2 hours early and I would have enough time to get. Checked in have someone help me if needed. When I got to Heathrow 3.5 hrs early TAP told me my covid test would not be accepted so would have to change my flight. I tried to talk to them but they told me to go change my flight and get out of line. I went to United airline counter bought a whole new ticket, waited 8 hours at the airport and got home with no problems with United.",0
"Kuala Lumpur to London. The last time I used MH was 2010 and I thought of giving Malaysia Airlines another chance. Unfortunately the nightmares started on the time I boarded. I requested to have sandwiches since I was feeling hungry after 8 hours in flight. Unfortunately, the male cabin crew informed me they do not provide snack like sandwiches. Then, I asked for any possibility to have peanuts but was told not it is not available. The crew asked me to wait for the next meal. Next my luggage is damaged. It is an up hill struggle to get response from Malaysia Airlines. Email is also send to management to follow but no reply. Does Malaysia airlines understand the philosophy of business concept. ",0
Belfast to London. In the last 2 months I have flown with easyJet 4 times. Never again unless I really have to. I was meant to fly out from Belfast International Airport at 3.40pm on Friday 21st September to visit my son on Norwich. We expected to get the 5.30pm train from the airport. One delay after another ensued with Easyjet staff being unhelpful and not even apologising once for the delay. Even the pilot who eventually pulled away from the stand at 5pm did not even have the grace to explain the delay. Our dinner in Norwich booked for 8pm had to be cancelled as we arrived at 10pm. Now I find myself back again at the airport and and am again delayed for the return flight home. No apologies again. easyJet truly are a horrible airline with absolutely no customer service or manners.,0
"AtlasGlobal cancelled my flight in December. I received an email in Turkish which I had to translate first. After this I called Atlasglobal for refund, they told me to call Supersaver since I booked my flight  with them. Supersaver tells me they need an authorization code from Atlasglobal before they refund.  So as a passenger this cancellation is my problem and I have to take care of this? Supervaser refuses to call atlas global and they refuse to help me. I have called both parties over 5 times now and no one is listening.",0
"Despite checking in online at the earliest possible time my partner and I were allocated seats apart. This is Jet2.com being cynical as we hadn't gone to the extra expense of pre booking seats. There must have been empty seats together at the time of checking in, but no, we were deliberately split. What if we had a child with us, whatever age? Apart from that happening both ways the seats have got to be the most uncomfortable we have experienced. ",0
"First time flying with Airasia. Hospitality and customer service was excellent. I arrived late in airport due to my car got an accident and check in gate was closed. However upon requesting airline staff that I have international connection, they allowed and assisted me in getting to the aircraft. A very big thank you to AirAsia India for making my travel successful.",1
"American Airlines delayed my flight for 3 hours because they didn't have the ""proper crew with experience to fly from San Jose to Dallas"". I finally get to Dallas and they have canceled my flight to Houston for weather reasons. Other airlines would have delayed the flight as the weather passes. The 3 times I've had to fly them it's been the same experience.",0
"Tel Aviv to Guangzhou via Beijing. I would like to thank Hainan Airlines ground staff in Beijing for assisting me to transfer smoothly to my next flight. They were very nice, directed me to the terminal and made sure that I don't miss my next flight.",1
"Do not fly Spirit unless you have lots of time to spare. My flight from Denver to Minneapolis was canceled on Sunday June 14, 2015 afternoon due to the fact that they did not have a pilot. There was only one agent at the Denver desk helping people who had to be rescheduled. The wait in line was well over 1 hour. The next direct flight on Spirit was two days later ! All other airlines were totally booked for that evening. They would not put me on a direct Delta flight for the next morning. It was a very bad experience. It was a very costly experience.",0
"SAS don't do business class on their short haul flights, only SAS Plus, which is Premium Economy. I checked in online as usual. At the airport I collected my luggage tag, put it on and then went to the bagdrop counter to drop the bag. I asked for a priority tag. The guy at the bagdrop nodded so I thought I was getting one. In Kiruna my bag arrived after most people had collected their bag. There was no food served. I got a smoothie and a can of mineral water. The passenger next to me got some wine and a small bag of crisps. Flying SAS these days feels more like flying Ryanair. The service at the airport and onboard is terrible. It is so not worth it to pay extra to fly SAS Plus. The lounge in terminal 4 is small and also awful. You pay a bit more for something extra but don't be surprised if they treat you badly. Ground staff not very friendly.  Glad I don't have to fly with them too often.",0
"Our first flight from Helsinki to Kiev changed its time without notifiying us and we only realised the day before when doing the check in. The departure time of the flight was advanced 1 hour and a half on a Thursday afternoon so I had to leave work earlier than expected. The boarding of the plane was done via a bus which made didn't make it smooth and once in the plane we had to wait for a couple more buses to come so it was slow and therefore left with delay. Because of change in the flight departure, we had a 4 hour stop over in Kiev Airport which was not great as there is only one restaurant to have dinner. After that, the next boarding was also via bus. Again, it was not a smooth boarding. Staff were not very nice, seats were really narrow and seat storage area was broken so couldn't fit my legs in the seat. Price was not cheap at all compared to other airlines so I doubt I fly again with them as I had a quite bad experience.",0
"Tijuana to Culiacan. I have been flying Volaris for years now. I love the flight, but hate how they constantly screw the customer on any changes or cancellations. I guess they get away with it because they are a Mexican company. the latest fiasco was I purchased a ticket. 3 hours later tried to cancel, but they wouldn't let me and get my monies back. I spent hours on the phone with them. They tried to change my ticket instead. they only had change flights that were non direct, probably knowing I wouldn't do it. The direct were available per the online booking, but they never showed those flights if you wanted to change your ticket. It went on and on and on. hours and hours. They would never make up for their mistakes which were numerous.",0
Dublin to Manchester. Would just like to say this is first time of being on a flight that nuts are not allowed. My partner didn't come with us but has a nut allergy and I hope other airlines would follow suit when necessary.  Even though only a short flight everything ok. Wasn't happy about my bag ending up in hold on way home as had to wait ages at carousel for it but overall very good.,1
"I booked a flight from Berlin SXF to Sarajevo via Istanbul SAW, sadly due to the weather conditions in Sarajevo my plane from Istanbul could not depart. Pegasus Airlines had at that time no other available option for the next 3 days, so they put us up in a hotel. But the company managed to organize an unplanned flight so Belgrade and then a bus till Sarajevo. They did everything very efficiently. They found a great solution and so once more kudos to Pegasus.",1
"Chinese Embassy in the Netherlands announced that no transfer passengers would be allowed to enter the Netherlands for the connecting flight to China from 18th November. XiaMen Airline is aware of this new policy. However, they continue advertising and selling the connecting flight tickets through the Netherlands! I bought the ticket from London to China via an overnight transfer in Amsterdam. However, when I started to go through the details soon after I bought the ticket, I was shocked to find out that this is an impossible flight route due to the reason above. I contacted XiaMen Airline immediately. I received a reply call informing me that my request for refunding my flight ticket is rejected. The reason given was that XiaMen Airline made a policy, they only refund the flight tickets which were bought before 31st October 2020, and the flight will take off after 31st October 2020. My flight ticket was bought yesterday, 9th December 2020. Therefore, I fell out of the category of refunding. I pointed out that if they knew this is the policy, why they were still selling the tickets from London to China, which needs to transfer at Amsterdam. I was told that it was because some passengers will take the flights from Amsterdam. This was not answering my question. However, the customer service only gave me standard answers in a circle. I would advise all, try all means to avoid buying flight tickets from Xiamen Air.",0
"Miami to Paris. I would like to say thank you to Godfrey a supervisor in the reservation service department for assisting me with my reservation after having the worst experience with a representative on the phone.

"I always fly with my service animal. I went to drop off my bag at the counter and showed them my ticket. The girl said she couldn't find my DOT service animal form. I showed her in my phone the email that Allegiant had requested with the pdf form attached. She said she wasn't sure if she could accept that as evidence. I opened the pdf for her to see. She said that would not work now because they would have needed that form 48 hours earlier. I said, you really aren't going to tell me that I can't fly today? Yes sir, that's right. I told her and the weekend manager that I wasn't leaving unless I got on that plane. She called a security guard and the manager said ""We've cancelled your reservation and returned your money sir. I've never had an airline work so hard to not accept a fare before. I'm 66yo, disabled, and after Uber had dropped me off after an hour I was then stranded with my dog at the airport looking for a way to go home",0
"Flew Delhi to Kathmandu. Terrible chaotic check in with no signs showing domestic and international queues at the same checking area so tonnes of people lining up in wrong line. Bag was 3.9 kg over, the check in guy said it would be 400 per kg so I say ok, then you have to go to another office and pay. The check in process is a prelude to the flight. I've flown many times with Jet Airways because I go between Ladakh and Nepal a lot and this airline is very poor. Staff are rude and unresponsive and don't want to bother with anything.",0
Flew from Toronto to Paris then on to Malaga on February 4th returned same route and airline February 24th. Never flown with Air France before but will from now on. Excellent cabin crews good food and wine clean comfortable jets on time never lost our baggage and short layovers in Paris both ways. I am booking second trip with them in September now.,1
"Riga to London. Cheap ticket, cheap airline. Staff at Riga airport is ridiculous. Flight was delayed, then no apologies whatsoever, plus treating all passangers like cattle. Very poor service.",0
"Barcelona to New York via London. I was in Barcelona for just four days so had one small bag which they asked me to check. My flight from Barcelona to London was delayed causing  passengers to miss their connections. When I finally got a flight, we taxied for an hour and then were told we needed to return to the gate as the luggage was loaded incorrectly. It took me nearly 24 hours to travel from Barcelona to JFK.  When I arrived, my luggage wasn't there so I filed a claim. I called and emailed every day and they couldn't find it even though I had a tag number and and documentation. Eight days later, they finally contacted me and gave me a six hour window for bag delivery. The final insult is that I was expected to file a claim for my missing personal property within seven days. As a result, they have offered me no compensation for damages.",0
TG 911  30th Jan 2015. Inbound flight TG916 on 27th Feb 2015. I have been married to my Thai wife now for 25 years and we have both travelled with Thai Airways for most of those years. I have just returned on TG916 on the 27th Feb 2015 and it is so sad to see an airline as good as this going down in quality. The food ran out the audio didn't work one toilet was out of order to the the extent the flight crew actually removed the toilet pan right next to my seat. When I said my audio did not work staff checked it and totally agreed with me but did nothing to help even though the flight had 9 unused seats. I know Thai people do not like to lose face but this service loses face for Thailand. What a shame.,0
We had the most amazing flight crew on the way home from Milan to Newark. They were just lovely. Seats were very comfortable considering I have very long legs. Best experience flying ever!,1
"Beijing to Addis Ababa. I booked a flight through trip.com. I was informed by trip.com that my flight was cancelled due to recent flight restrictions. I phoned trip.com and received the expected answer that my full ticket will be refunded to me, due to the airline cancelling the flight. . I received a email that a third of my ticket price will be taken for cancelation fees and I need to respond within 3 hours to accept this. Neither trip.com nor Ethiopian airlines provided me with a reason therefore. Don't bother using trip.com, book directly through the airline and save on the fees you will have to pay trip.com.",0
"I would really like to express my compliments to the Easyjet crew and ground staff who were on duty for the flight from Amsterdam to Prague on December 16 2017. Due to circumstances we arrived very late at the airport. If easyet would have sticked to their rules we wouldn't be allowed to board, but we were luck. We made the flight and the way we were welcomed on board was fantastic. Also the ground crew were great. The flight itself was good. Never had a bad experience, I have been flying with them a lot since 1998.",1
"Santiago de Chile to Cusco. They have awful customer service, they charge for everything. Staff is unfriendly and rude, I had a couple of issues in Lima and Santiago with the staff on ground. They were threatening me 40 min before the scheduled time to leave me if I did not board the plane immediately even if the boarding pass said gates closed 20 minutes before flight. I explained the staff that my elderly mother was at the restroom and that it was still early, they guy was threatening her to leave her on ground if she did not board the plane. Once we boarded the plane, the gates did not close until 20 minutes after, and when we were ready to take off the captain said theres was an issue with the aircraft, we had to wait almost 3 hours on the plane with very little information about the issue, until finally the plane took off.",0
"New York to Rome via Lisbon. Very poor customer service. Cancellation policy is a scam to take as much money from clients and in my case, amounted to more than the price of the tickets. I would not recommend this airline at all. Not even to my worse enemy.",0
Cabin crew are polite and great service on short flight. In cabin very comfortable and clean toilets. Ground staff are service minded with clear answers.,1
"Flew Allegiant Air from Las Vegas to Billings, MT. I will never give them another cent of my money, I have flown them four times now and not once have I had a flight without issues. Flight was supposed to leave at 08.11, yet here I sit again due to their faulty aircraft. Save your money, I will spend a few bucks more and take a trusted airline next time. ",0
"Swiss used to be good but now are absolutely horrible to. The 14hr flight was just unpleasant. The seats were tiny, the entertainment years out of date. The service was unhelpful and the stewards were strangely aggressive to requests such as getting water on a long haul flight and continually bumping you in your seat. I literally had to beg them for food when they skipped out rows during service. The food quality was very poor. Then they rebook your connecting flight and lose your luggage and make no effort to redress the situation. Even if you call their contact line there is no response except to redirect you to a useless online form. About 7 people on the same flight have lost their luggage and nothing from Swiss.",0
Brussels Charleroi to Istanbul. I have travelled up to 10 times with this airline in the last two years and this lastest experience has pushed me more to take the time to write this negative review. Cabin crew are unwelcoming individuals. The majority of employees don't seem to enjoy what they do or the way they are being treated by the management. The amount of rude employees is appaling. I don't believe I have ever written such a negative comment about a service and frankly I regret having to do so.,0
Koh Samui to Bangkok. Great airline and great to have access to their lounge for refreshments. Come a little early and asked nicely if we had to switch to an earlier flight and they fixed it in one minute. Even the food on the flight have gotten better and we will definitely fly with Bangkok Airways again.,1
"Dubai to Kiev with Ukraine International. I reported a lost iPad, as I just left it in the seat pocket, no problems that is my fault. What I am talking of here is an airline that has little to do with the provision of sevice or having the courtesy to call one back. Essentially I went through around 12 rounds of deflection, lies, misdirection, and no one did their job. ",0
"Melbourne to Perth. Terrible customer service from the point of booking, on board to the point of returning. Absolute scammers. Cant ever talk to someone who understands clear english or what I'm trying to communicate. Very unhelpful staff over the phone. Treat you terrible. No sense of customer service.",0
"We have booked our tickets 4 months ahead of schedule from Newark to Rome. They informed us by email that our flight was changed to 2 days later for departure without any reasons. These changes will affect our schedule significantly. We have 2 options, we have to accept the changes or we have to cancel. We have also a connection flight from Rome with Alitalia.",0
"Baltimore to Nashville. I had no issues with Spirit Airline, I actually thought they were very quick with boarding and un boarding both ways! The flight was quick, comfortable. If you do your research beforehand on carry on bags, fees, etc it will be much more pleasant. I would fly again.",1
"Terrible experience with EasyJet. They do not allow customers to claim for a voucher after they changed the flight departing time. I am still waiting on the phone for 22 minutes and counting, no one picks up and music plays. Emailed them several times with no answer either.",0
Had a chance to fly home after 6 years. Decided to trust American Airlines. Worst mistake I have ever made. Thank you for wasting what little precious moments I have with them.,0
Flew from Muenster Osnabrueck to Corfu 2nd August and returned 6th September 2014. As we had our dog and dog box we found the service by Air Berlin staff at both airports very helpful and my family are grateful for this service. We travel every year to Corfu for a long summer holiday and certainly shall use Air Berlin again.,1
Flew Qatar Airways from Bangkok to Copenhagen via Doha. Standards even higher than before. Did in total 6 premium flights and 2 economy. All flights top notch service and excellent crew. Only downside is missing alcohol in lounge during Ramadan. Apart from that flawless product. By far my first choice of airline.,1
"Sydney to Rome via Singapore. First time travelling business my seat was literally located within 50cm of the toilets at the rear of business class. During this long flight these toilets were continually in use not only by business class but also economy class, and i was kept awake. I believe that these seats should not be offered as business class given there location. I would have rather spent the flight in economy class rather then being next to the toilets",0
"Perfect short flight from London Heathrow to Paris Charles de Gaulle. Very easy check in on the Air France app. Boarding was fast and organised, the aircraft was clean and comfortable. The flight departed on time, pastries and hot beverages was offered for breakfast during this 40 mins flight. Totally enjoyed flying with Air France.",1
"I've travelled to Europe for 20 years and have never experienced such an awful flight before. Eurowings Discover is the worst airline. My original flight was cancelled due to Lufthansa protests and we were booked 7 days later with a Eurowings discover flight to For Myers. I was traveling with my 1 year old baby girl and my 7 year old son. As soon as we got to our seats, we noticed everyone's TV's had power but our did not. We asked the flight attendant to please turn on our screens and she just replied that they are out of order and the flight is fully booked so they can't do anything. I replied that this is unacceptable. We're traveling with children on a 10 and a half hour flight, why was I sold these seats if the screens don't operate? She just said, I'm sorry I will ask my cabin manager if we can do something.  The flight attendant never returned with a solution. I then pulled a 2nd attendant and asked to speak to the cabin manager. Another hour goes by and still nothing! I got very upset. It seemed like nobody cared that they took our money and everyone had working screens but us. I got up and went to the attendant zone. I waited 20 minutes to speak to someone. A guy came out and said, that he apologized but there is nothing he can do except to send a message to the airline that will send partial reimbursement for the inconvenience. We had the most boring flight. The food that was served to us was disgusting. We were given a sandwich with  carrots and soggy cheese on a cold bread.  I asked if I can purchase food of any sort other than what they gave us, and all they had to offer us for a purchase was a chocolate stick, a snickers bar or peanuts. The drinks they served were tiny 3 inch plastic cups filled half way with water or soda. The seat had no bassinet attachment for the baby and I had to hold her in my hands for 10 and a half hours. Previous airlines I've traveled to Europe with had a bassinet attachment and the baby sleeps in that. All in all, absolutely the worst food, worst experience flying.  Empty promises that they will send a partial credit. As we walked out they waved bye and we never  received an apology email or a credit.",0
"Dubai to Marseille via Istanbul and Pegasus Airlines is the worst airline I have taken. I booked and paid for a breakfast that I never had. The organization of the check in was so messy that it took hours, the staff was not nice, especially in Istanbul, and definitely not helpful. This is not an international airlines, barely a flying bus.",0
"Cape Town to Johannesburg. I am disgusted at the service I received at Flysafair, I had booked my ticket through Travelstart and I was asked how many bags I would to pay for, I then paid for 3 bags when doing my booking considering the fact that I was booking 6 return flights, from Johannesburg to Cape Town and back again, the cost for the bags was R450, which was calculated at R150 a bag. Once the online check in was opened, I went online to check in and I selected our 6 seats next to each other however when I got to the airport air boarding passes had different seats numbers, I was very unhappy with this because I was traveling with kids who were traveling by plane for the first time and I had to seat my children with strangers how upsetting. In any case I decided to do the online check again when it was time to come back and guess what we were placed in different seats again and to top it off I was told that I had not paid for my luggage and I had to now pay an additional R750 for the 3 bags because that is airport fees. I am very angry at the bad service I received, be careful of these cheap airflights they actually not cheap and are actually a rip off. Why pay for luggage, when I'm already traveling with you guys, I would much rather use Mango or Khulula next time. All the money I paid for nothing and their seats are uncomfortable and there very little space, in fact no leg space at all.",0
"Rome to Melbourne via Singapore. Check in Rome was quick, efficient and friendly but from there it was all downhill. Singapore Airlines use a common use airline lounge in Rome not affiliated with any specific airline. Lounge is very dated and standing room only when full as it was on this day. Food offerings were a stale pound cake and a bowl of nuts. The bar area was covered in dirty used glasses.  I left the lounge and bought water from a vending machine. The aircraft was a refitted 777 that looked every bit it's 16 years old. The purser was very friendly and the rest of the crew in business class were also alright on the Rome to Singapore leg. The seat was large but very uncomfortable in seated and bed positions. The meal was not great and quality sub standard. The next flight out of Singapore to Melbourne while the aircraft was new was the biggest disappointment. The crew rushed both services and literally threw the table clothes and utensils down. Bread baskets thrust at passengers without offering bread. All done without uttering a single word to customers. From the noise coming out of the galley they were capable of talking and laughing just not with their customers.  I wouldn't have given more than 2 stars from their product and crew .",0
"Gatwick to Bologna. We flew with easyjet in August although i had not flown for a number of years. The experience was superb, everything from the booking through to the landing at Bologna went as planned. There was a 25 minute delay, not the fault of easyjet. The cabin crew were fantastic and looked after us well and the flight crew kept us informed regarding the delay.",1
ZB439 from Fuerteventura to Birmingham Sat 31st May 2014. Fantastic flight lovely friendly cabin crew and to top it all off a brand new Airbus A321.,1
"London to Guangzhou business class, Boeing 787, it was nice flight experience. Brand new airplane, I love the night ambiance on the window, the flight was quiet and smooth. The cabin crew were very friendly and attentive, they help me to put my luggage in the Overhead carrier. As soon as I took the seat they offered welcome drinks. In Flight Entertainment program are fairly good, there are a lot of movies and TV programs. Catering on the flights improved since my last trip, The meals were of adequate portions and tasted standard. China Southern Airlines improvement is spectacular when comparing it to 2 years ago. Will continue with them for all my travel whenever is possible.",1
"London to Mauritius. In July 2017 myself, my wife and 2 children aged 1 and 3 travelled to Mauritius. As a regular kestrel Flyer, I expected better treatment and better service. They are very child unfriendly.  When we landed, one of our luggage was missing. This is despite the flight was the flight was delayed by more than one hour. We landed on a Sunday, and had to attend a wedding the same night. My wedding clothes and that of my wife were in that luggage. I complained to the staff, they could not care less and said I was not entitled to anything and was sent away. No manager was available and later in turned out that the duty manager on the day was busy attending to the Prime Minister's wife in the State lounge and could not be bothered about paying passengers. I complained to their customer service, and the service I received was poor. I wrote to the CEO and their Chairman. No response at all from them. When we returned to the UK 2 weeks later, two Air Mauritius Staff were travelling. They were being given business class treatment when they were travelling in economy in front of paying customers. I spoke to the cabin crew about this, and they could not care less. What they offered me is 5000 travel points, 50 Euros, and to use their lounge when I travel next which is pathetic to what my family went through travelling with them.",0
"United is garbage. They loaded the plane from Houston to Tampa and we sat there waiting for the pilots for over an hour at the gate. Terrible communication. No remorse, poor planning and management. Try to avoid flying them. Worse then the budget airlines in my opinion",0
"Moscow to Santiago de Chile via Paris. This is the worst flight experience my wife and I ever had in our lives. My wife's luggage was checked in at Moscow and was supposed to arrive directly to Santiago. However, by the time of our arrival my wife's luggage was not there and the Air France representative told us that it would only arrive with the next flight. In total, half of our luggage went missing, including the most basic clothes, what resulted in the necessity to go immediately to a shopping mall and spending money on new clean clothing. I have also learnt later that after making the claim about the delayed luggage, one piece is actually missing and Air France can't find it. Disgusting and really bad service from a company of such level. My wife and I will never use this airline ever again and we have also told our friends to avoid it.",0
Don't fly Allegiant day after Super Bowl two crews flying out of Phoenix Mesa failed to show up resulting in significant delays. AZA to GTF delayed at least 4 hours and counting. Weather fine at both ends of flight. Obviously no backup crews. Communication of delays is poor. Flights are inexpensive but airline may be operating over it's head. Could be an airline with a bright future if it can sort out it's operational issues. They did offer refreshments and food voucher after 2 hours of waiting.,0
"The shameless laziness and inefficiency is mind boggling. I'm standing in the bag drop line in Vancouver. Luggage tags in place. All I need to do is hand bags to employee for the carousel. Problem is, 10 windows, zero employees. The last employee announced she is taking an hour and a half break and just left. Passengers just standing here befuddled. This airline needs to go out of business. Avoid at all costs!",0
"Vancouver to Victoria. I feel the need to leave a comment here in regards to the disorganization that Air Canada has in regards to baggage. I was delayed and missed our connecting flight home due to customs. I had asked every attendant or working persons that we had dealings with about whether I needed to get my luggage and everyone stressed due not worry about it. And like many would be, I was. I work hard for a living to have nice things, some of those of which I had brought on our trip.  There is no system in place and the bag never made it back home. I have been calling into what seems to be a secondary bag check line with zero information as to where it is. I am being told it is still in tracking mode. How is there not a better system with bag tags.",0
"Sorely disappointed. This was supposed to be our first time flying with Breeze, but they screwed up big time and we will never fly with them again. Our original flight was for yesterday night, but they delayed a few hours then rescheduled for this morning. This morning, they were delayed an hour or so, then all the sudden canceled completely. This is extremely unprofessional, but at least they refunded our tickets. Also, their online services are horrible and all their links go to their web page saying they don't believe in call centres. When you message them, it takes a day for them to respond so don't expect anything immediate if you're having issues.",0
"I chose EL AL believing in Israeli efficiency in so many areas. I was surprised, before I flew to read guidance to passengers ""dont be rude to airline staff"", almost as if they expected passengers to be annoyed with service. Security at Heathrow was poor as the ""extra"" booked luggage X ray machine was not working , however most airline from Heathrow dont have this extra checking. The flight, seats, leg room food was average and service not very friendly. It became apparent the plane was delayed and I might miss my connection at Tel Aviv. so I asked a stewardess to ensure my checked in bags got on the next flight. Her attitude didn't give me confidence she would do this, Sure enough after another mediocre flight to Johannesburg my bag didn't arrive. After waiting at the carousel I asked where the El Al office was. I eventually found this but no one was there. and no notice of how to contact staff. The next door office gave me a number to ring and I was told someone would meet me at their office. An hour later someone came and took details of my bag but couldn't say when it would arrive but said it would be sent to my hotel. No apology. I asked how much of my costs of extra clothes would be reimbursed but he couldn't say. Eventually after 3 days my bag and clothes arrived, again no apologies and no reimbursement of expenses. At the end of my stay I tore up my return ticket and booked a single on SAA.",0
"My plane from Chicago Midway left late. I almost missed that flight. I had to keep asking for a wheelchair. I get to Atlanta only to find out that I missed my flight, which was the last flight to Birmingham. I was told I could fly out Monday. We'll I have to be at work Monday so I had to find someone to come get me from Birmingham. When you sell tickets please let people know they are purchasing a ticket at their own risk. Don't let them know after purchasing their tickets. They are alternative ways of travel. Tired and very disappointed with your service.",0
"My original flight left a little late and going thru Customs took longer than usual. I showed up at my connecting flight at 0704 when my flight had a departure time of 0715. The agent told me they had a 15 minute policy of closing the doors 15 minutes prior to departure. She wouldn't let me on board. I had to rebook for a flight arriving the next day because of this. Since I was stuck at the airport all day, I made some observations and saw that there were plenty of flights which kept their doors open just minutes before departure time. What a malicious act on the part of the agent. Explicitly poor customer service. My plane was still at the door and she was still at the counter. She could have easily let me on board just like the other agents I observed. Just livid about wasting 24 hours at the airport and a work day. Needless to say I will not be using Spirit again.",0
"Denver to New York. Sitting at Denver airport, flight is 25mins late. No announcement or update from anyone. The crew are just as confused as the passengers. Not a great start.",0
Westjet may be fine for a very short flight. But to Hawaii forget it. Always late. Terrible service. Very uncomfortable. The staff are grumpy and spend most of their time in the galley eating and gossiping. Very disappointing.,0
"Tijuana to Acapulco. Horrible experience. Flight was cancelled. Waited 4 hours in disorganized lines to find out would not be compensated for it. Absolutely unacceptable service. Outright theft. No plane ever left the ground for this flight, yet they are unwilling to refund tickets OR give vouchers. Their policy is to rebook within 24 hours and use the new ticket within 30 days. I missed that 24 hour window due to their own lack of organization and customer service hours. And how am I supposed to plan a new trip within the next 24 hours to be used in 30 days with work obligations and other things already planned in life? It's a scam to get the customer to spend more money on more expensive tickets and return flights. Horrible policy. Furthermore, the hours of lines were all due to this policy, as people were trying to schedule new flights within that 24 hour window! They manufactured their own problems at the passenger's expense. Refunds or even just issuing vouchers would be so much more efficient and Volaris would not have angry customers waiting in lines for hours! Horrible business.",0
"When I had initially purchased my flight for my fiance' and I, I paid the extra fee for us to pick our seats, to sit together. Day of departure from Sacramento, we no longer had seats assignments. Furthermore, the in flight entertainment and wifi, never worked. The day we are due to fly back to Sacramento from Honolulu, again we lost our seats we picked when purchasing our tickets. We were given random seats and not together. Waited for over 30 minutes before they had an agent at the gate for help. Still we waited another 45 minutes",0
"Cardiff to Doha via Bangkok. The opportunity of flying from my local airport to Bangkok via Doha on Qatar Airways was too good to miss. Despite officious behaviour of some Cardiff Airport staff who did their best to upset my autistic son. We opted for economy out and business back and overall were delighted, the value for money offered by economy was excellent and must put some business class offerings to shame. The business class on return was superb, the cabin staff were excellent and keen to chat with my self and my son who appreciated being treated like an adult and being allowed to choose what he wanted from the menu. The flight was full both ways so I hope this service continues despite the rough and ready ground service at Cardiff which was the exception to that we encountered elsewhere on our journey.",1
"On an evening flight from Athens to Stockholm Norwegian had to swap out the aircraft and the replacement was smaller than the original and a group of us were denied boarding. No issue here. Problems began after that. We were on a direct flight and eventually got booked on a flight the next day with an 8 hour layover although there was originally a direct flight available and even later flight options with 4 hour layovers. We were given a meal voucher only good at McDonalds. We were kept at the airport for 2 hours and booked on a 6.30 am flight meaning we got a maximum of 5 hours sleep assuming no time for shower. Called customer service as directed by gate agent who first denied any problem with flight, then told me it ""wasn't possible"" to book onto a better flight. I asked her why they wouldn't and she just kept repeating it ""wasn't possible"" and hung up on me. No compensation given at airport but instead directed to an online form. Online form didn't work and had to call customer service. Customer service had me fill out a general email feedback. Waiting with low expectations of ever getting compensation.",0
"Sadly I have to say the worst airline I have flown on. I'm from Alaska an they do not represent us, I don't know where to start, everything that can go wrong did. And good luck getting them on the phone or even at the airport for that matter, 7 hrs on the phone, I finally gave up and waited for a call back. They did not help or fix any of the problems! Made no effort to even try to act like they cared, even the other airline had nothing but disappointing things to say about the the invisible staff nowhere to be found. When on the phone they said they had staff at the booking counter but I was standing there. So disappointing, this is now the second and last time I use them. If you fly Alaska you know what I'm saying is unfortunately the truth. I should have learnt the 1st time. Best of luck to any one that makes the same mistakes I did. Just for fun try calling and see for yourself.",0
When we were leaving Serbia they delayed our flight. I asked information desk and they said they had no information about the flight. I asked a person at the gate and she told me the plane was here and there were no issues. So after waiting we asked information and they said the plane was in the air and expected to arrive soon. So after waiting some more we asked information again and they said the plane was stuck in Turkey because of bad weather. I checked the weather radar in Turkey and there was no cloud over Turkey. The customers were getting irritated and the information lady said if anyone else asked that she would call the cops on everyone in line. Customer service does not exist in Air Serbia.,0
Casablanca to Muscat. I was impressed with everything about Oman Air. This was our third flight after our two legs going to Europe and this the first returning home to Australia. The service was excellent on all legs and the food was some of the best airline food I have had. The business class seat is all you could want and I managed 5 hours sleep. There was a great selection of wine and other beverages.,1
Mykonos to Athens. Worst airlines. Delayed flight up to 9 hrs and no refund still. Do not go with them.. Their planes have technical issues. Not worth it. Customer and ground team are horrific.,0
Flew Leeds to Berlin and return. Flights slightly late departing but still arrived on time. Yes their aircraft's are not the newest but have all had interior cabin refit which seems to provide more than ample legroom for a loco airline. Always find the Jet2 cabin crew amongst the friendliest. No qualms flying them again.,1
I flew yesterday to and fro from Jersey to Guernsey. I was extremely impressed with the lounge reception and all is facilities. I am slightly disabled and the Stewardess was very helpful and attentive on both my journeys. Plenty of leg room on the plane and good and comfortable flight. I will certainly use them again when I can.,1
"Terrible airline. I flew from Boston to Toronto via Laguardia. The plane was delayed for 2 hours in Boston, then they said that I would miss my connection from Laguardia to Toronto. They rerouted my to a flight from JFK to Toronto. When I arrived in Laguardia, they lost my bag and it took me two hours to retrieve it. Airline staff at Laguardia was rude and not helpful. I took a cab to JFK from Laguardia, when I arrived at JFK, I found out AFTER going through security that my flight to Toronto was cancelled. They sent me back to Laguardia, made me standby for two flights, neither of which materialised. There is no apology, no explanation, no compensation. I had to catch a flight from Toronto to Asia, and obviously I missed that and had to take care of the changes, and hotel stay at NYC.",0
San Francisco to Orange County. I wanted to give Antonio C..... at the SFO airport a big thank you for understanding my situation and accommodated my request for earlier flight. Great employee at this airport was very understandable and sweet. Agent at the kiosk was very rude and not helpful.,1
No issues at all. Great price. I followed all their instructions to avoid extra charges. I would definitely fly with them again. Flight was on time. Captain and crew were very friendly. I booked an economy airline and got exactly what I was expecting.,1
Flight back to Oslo was cancelled 2 hours before departure with offer to rebook 5 days later. Have traveled with Eurowings on the same route a few years back and then the flight was cancelled as well. Totally unreliable airline.,0
United improbably informed us two days in advance that our flight from Albuquerque to Denver connecting to Minneapolis would most likely be delayed? Good to their word they got us to Denver an hour and a half late missing our connection maintenance issues was the reason. We had managed to rebook our connection in Albuquerque the agent assuring us our luggage would remain in Denver. Now it's 10pm no luggage and waiting in line with approximately 400 people to get to one service desk. 2 Hours later we have a hotel voucher and nothing else talked to some low level manager who couldn't understand why 2 full fare first class customers were upset after all we got a free hotel room.,0
"Rome to Gatwick. Poor all round. I was asked to put my hand luggage in the hold due to ""running out of space in the lockers"". How they determined this I don't know as when I arrived at my seat the overhead locker was empty. It would appear they just pick suitcase style hand luggage at random to be put in the hold. The flight was inexplicably delayed for more than 30 minutes for no clear reason with no correspondence from the crew or pilot.Seats are your standard easyJet esc ones, reasonable enough for a short haul flight. Food is limited and expensive, as is drink. No WiFi. The fact they don't let you check in until a well prior to the flight in an attempt to get more money out of you encompasses all this airline appears to care about.",0
"Dubai to Urumqi via Wuhan and Guangzhou. In the return journey, they check the luggage directly to Dubai via Guangzhou, no need to take out the luggage in Guangzhou. The crew is polite and try to meet your demand in a comfortable way. The food and beverage is abundant and they provide some traditional Chinese exercising tv programme for relaxing.",1
"Odessa to Stockholm via Warsaw, flying with LOT Polish Airlines for my first time. Clean and fresh cabin. Good feeling in the seat, good legs space. Tasty meal and a cool beer. Black swedish type of coffee. Positive and nice cabin staff.",1
"They have the worst support ever! No online option for cancelling a ticket. When I wrote to them to cancel the ticket, they answered me once with the options. When I have told them what to do, they have not replied again. I tried to call them various times, but each time after 5 minutes the call is being ended because nobody picked up.",0
I was trying to do check in on line but my phone battery was dead I needed a plug or a place where to charge my phone been told to wait outside and come back 1 hour before depart. I couldn't check in then when i went to check in desk they asked me the boarding card i explained what happen but they didn't want hear any reason. I had to pay 35 euro for a print on a piece of paper and then I received a receipt of 30 euro then went back and show the receipt then i got the pass. I had 2 bag with me just hand bags and they asked me i had to pay for one OK 25 euro but the receipt was 20 euro. Also the flight was 45 minutes late and nobody even apologise. Worst airline ever.,0
"Aircraft was cleanest, cabin crew were awesome, one of my family members forgot their power bank in luggage bag but vistara staff was very helpful in returning it to me and they were very calm and patient. Awesome flight Experience. It landed before the scheduled Landing time. 10 out of 10 for Vistara",1
"Terrible customer service, employees are not aware of airline policies. In my case, the airline canceled my trip in October 2020. The second time I was unable to travel, there were no flights available to my destination on the dates I could fly. On the third occasion they gave me a date to change my flight and when I called, my flight was canceled 7 hours before because I called in US time and not in Polish time. I bought the flight in the US, so New York time must apply. I was never informed about this rule. Now my fourth problem is the refund, the travel agency LBF Travel and LOT Polish Airline are not doing anything to speed up my refund.",0
"Returning to Gatwick from Genoa after a cruise, and didn't realise that Titan Airways were operating for British Airways until we boarded the flight. Felt a bit nervous having not heard of this operator before. However, after a brief introduction of who Titan Airways were, and details of the flight route and weather conditions, the crew and cabin staff were excellent. This flight on an A320 was one of the best I have been on. No hesitation flying with them again.",1
"London to Geneva. Flying in business class I was expecting a hot meal, which used to be very nice on Swiss flights. Unfortunately they have stopped it and now business class passengers can  get a sandwich or anything else from the menu that is presented for charge to economy passengers. This is a disgrace for a full service airline charging for its supposedly premium service. Unfortunately I will fly with them again as they normally are cheaper then BA on LHR GVA route, but they can forget me in the business class.",0
"Stansted to Rabat. Very rude lady in charge of the crew. As if it was not enough we had 1h 30 delay inside the plane with no explanation, check in luggage put in the aircraft with no labels. They unloaded luggage and brought them inside the plane to ask who it belongs to, appalling! Very poor service.",0
"Worst airline, after 15 hours I will reach from Vancouver to Toronto. I booked direct flight from Vancouver to Toronto, they add one stop in Edmonton without my consent. I advice you not to book this airline in future.",0
Dhaka to Sylhet. It is the national airline of Bangladesh. Its service is quite good. The planes are brand new. The food is pretty good.,1
"Worst customer service. They lost my luggage and they did not contact me when it arrives 2 days later. They did not want to ship it to Quebec, so i had someone go to take it and there was no agent at the place they told me to go! No one, so i cant get to my luggage and I can't have someone on the phone to help me. Worst service for a mistake they make.",0
Mumbai to Delhi. Seat Comfort and Meal was good. Flight left on time and staff did their best to serve on board. To my surprise hot dinner was served on the domestic leg of international flight and the meal quality was pretty good. Seat pitch and comfort was better than average and I was quite happy with the flying experience.,1
"This company is horrific. We had a cancelation of our flight back home and this airline refused to refund our money. Fly Maya Island Air. They are exceptional, less expensive and very flexible. The planes are also shady. You will not regret flying Maya Island Air! Have a wonderful and safe flight.",0
"This entire experience has been absolutely appalling, I am utterly stunned at how an airline can be so incompetent, disrespectful to its customers, and downright threatening. Off the bat, within 24 hours both our international Phuket leg and our Sydney to Melbourne legs were cancelled. We were offered no apology, and thankfully, were given a new flight a day later to Phuket in which we lost our reserved seats that we had had booked for months. Not only did the service desk person in Melbourne airport absolutely berate my by the point crying mother, after the airline had already lost our bags, she proceeded to blackmail me into apologising to her for saying that ""Jetstar is run by Qantas so you're wrong"" or else I would not be able fly. On top of this, the manager was completely and utterly disinterested in assisting us. And yes, that's right, the airline also lost our luggage from the Sydney to Melbourne leg and offered us absolutely zero compensation I've never been treated so utterly horrendously not only by an airline but by any company I can possibly think of. I would absolutely, never, ever fly Jetstar ever again. This has been the worst travel experience of my life and has brought me to tears. Jetstar should be ashamed of themselves. You are an embarrassment to the country.",0
We booked tickets through Lufthansa and were reassured that we would get everything we had ordered. When my children and I got to the plane we weren't given the seats we had ordered. In fact the agent tried to blame me for not telling her about my request. When I said that we were told on the phone that everything was reserved she snapped it's reserved but not guaranteed. I did get the seats though. Our ordered children's meal never arrived since they discontinued it according to the flight attendant who spoke with me. the other flight attendant told a different story to the other families. I asked for the cot and was told that my daughter was too long.  I will conclude by saying it was on of the worst flying experiences.,0
"I wil be reluctant to fly with Transavia again. Today 8th July 2016 I was flying from Paris Orly to Dublin. The flight was delayed by almost an hour and a half. The problem we were informed was because of an engine fault. I understand that there can be an engine fault but what I cannot understand is why we had to sit in 30 degree of heat for so long. Surely if there was a fault the engineering staff preparing the aircraft for flight should have spotted the problem in the first instance. There was very little information given to the passengers during this time. All we saw was engineers going to and fro through the captains cabin. The pilots also at one stage left the aircraft leaving the passengers both bewildered and confused. Then just to add salt to the wound I had to pay for a cup of coffee. This happened, I might also add, on a very early morning flight when most or all of the passengers would not have had breakfast. Just not good enough.",0
"Milan to Malaga via Barcelona. Absolutely horrific. Never fly this airline! Especially if you have baggage. After we arrived in Malaga, there were about 15 people with lost bags. There was one lady, extremely slow dealing with the lost bags. She took 15 min just to deal with one guy, waiting for him to call his friends who could speak English etc. They then keep on telling you lies and wasting your time. I took this flight because it was the only option. If there is no other airline that day, instead of taking Vueling just cancel your plans and go the next day with another airline.",0
I was very satisfied with my Wizz Air flight. The crew were friendly and looked very professional. No issues whatsoever and the flight from Luton to Gdansk was on time. No issues with my hand baggage. As long as you understand their company policies on baggage fees than you will be fine. Very reasonably priced. Certainly will fly again.,1
"Absolutely disappointed. Flight was delayed three times, then cancelled. Did not have any room for overnight accommodations and or flights to New York within the next day. The earliest flight was three days later. The staff were very lax and or over it. I had to sleep on the airport where it was freezing and did not have access to bottled water and food or snacks let alone a blanket for warmth. So highly upset. Finally had to book a flight to Fort Lauderdale as a connect but I have to come out of pocket to fly back to NY. JetBlue has caused me to lose money. Never flying with them again!",0
"Ahmedabad to New York via Doha. Qatar Airways was the best choice especially during long trip like 13 to 14 hours. Cabin crew very polite, responding and engaging. Food was outstanding. Seats are pretty comfortable and wide enough to stretch your legs. It is the best airline among other airlines I travelled in. I would definitely fly with Qatar airways again.",1
"The team at Melbourne Virgin lounge and the crew on flight 1328 Melbourne to Hobart were absolutely amazing. I had injured my knee on way to the airport and was unable to put weight on it. Every person I had contact with from the service desk to the young chap who wheeled me to the gate to the fabulous ladies on the flight and the ground grew at Hobart went above and beyond what I expected. They were kind, helpful and made me feel comfortable even though I was embarrassed at all the fuss I was causing. I fly regularly with Virgin and will always recommend them.",1
"Denver to Salt Lake City. This was the worst flight I have ever been on. They boarded all passenger's 2.5 hours before we even took off. The flight attendants were terrible, didn't even apologize for the disaster of the delay in take off, the exhaust fumes during the wait caused me one of the worst headaches I have ever had. The one hour flight took three hours and they offered nothing to drink.  Never again will I fly this airline.",0
Simply superb service. Business class from ZRH to SFO. Was welcomed to my seat and addressed by name. Beginning to end the service was exemplary better than first class on many carriers. Food was quite good as were the wines. The SWISS business seat is completely flat and horizontal for sleeping. In short beginning to end as good as business class can be. Frankly I prefer the whole experience over that now being offered by the top Asian carriers. Should add flight left on time and arrived early.,1
"Complete joke of an airline. I was supposed to take a flight to Dallas and then get a connection to Baltimore. My first flight was delayed for maintenance and cause me to miss my connection. They gave me a new flight, this time adding another connection in Chicago. The flight to Chicago gets delayed an hour because we're waiting on the crew. I get to Chicago and my flight is once again delayed for maintenance. By the time I get to my original destination, it's been an extra 6 hours",0
"This airline is giving me the worst time ever. The over was fine, I requested a vegan meal and I didn't get one but that was fine. However, now I am trying to leave Berlin at a different date than I originally bought my return home ticket. I have been on the phone and texting with United for the past 3 hours and I have gotten nowhere. They convinced me to buy an upgrade so that my flight can be changed and now say my flight can be changed but there are no flights for my class, so I bought that ticket for no reason because now the only flight they're telling me I can do is 700 dollars which is almost as much as I paid for the ticket anyway. United does not care and they will not help you unless it puts an exorbitant amount of money in their own pockets.",0
"Newark to Raleigh Durham. Flying United once again was a horrible experience. Even though a passing storm stopped several hours before the departure the outbound flight was cancelled. I had to go to a university to attend classes for one week and when I checked in on the rescheduled flight, the flight attendant made me check my luggage even though my luggage basically met the carry on requirement, which caused me to be late to my class though my rescheduled flight left at 6am and I had plenty of time to get to class by 9am. One the way back my flight was delayed 4 hours though only a 1.5 hour flight. Once I got back to my airport, because they made me check my luggage again, I was delayed another hour since the luggage were put into a room without alerting anyone. United airline operates giving zero consideration to the customer's time, paying good money. Their attitude seems to be """"we are doing you a favor"""". The attendants are rude and I have never flown out on time nor reached my destination on time. United new carry on baggage policy is a scam. You have to board basically with nothing with you unless of course you pay more. It is a shame how United treat their customers so poorly and without much dignity.",0
"Paris CDG to Dusseldorf. The plane was leased from WDL Aviation. Biggest plus was the leg room. The plane not being full added to the comfort, because the middle seat was free. Attentive crew pointed passengers to empty rows for more comfort. Apart from that we got a drink and a tasty snack. On time boarding but despite that we landed 10 mins late in DUS. Paid 58 euros. All in all a very good choice.",1
We recently flew the Dreamliner from Melbourne to LA with 3 of our sons. We have flown United before on the old 747's. the Dreamliner is just beautiful great inflight entertainment larger windows which you can control making it darker with the touch of a button very friendly and happy staff always makes the 14 hour flight a lot more pleasant. The food was really good and the beverages were a good selection not too sure about paying for a beer when most other international airlines include that in the fare. Overall very happy to fly United for our family holiday's to America no delays whatsoever which is always great look forward to the next plane trip with United.,1
Gold Coast to Albury via Sydney. Really impressed with the staff and airline. We had an incident which caused us to be late and miss our flight home. The Virgin Australia staff were very calming and offered us an immediate solution! Super happy and thankful! I am definitely happy we chose to fly with Virgin Australia.,1
"I and my husband are 71 years old, flying regularly twice a year for many years and this flight was our worst flying experience ever! This flight was 6 hours long and we purchased the tickets with Emirates based on their advertising and did not mind paying almost double price than all the other companies charge. We wanted on this pretty long flight more comfort, wider seats, more legroom, good food and overall better experience as Emirates advertise. The outbound flight was with Emirates partner company FLy Dubai, Boeing 737Max not Airbus 380 as they advertise. Nothing of the advertisement was true. The airplane had regular narrow seats and little legroom and there was no complimentary drinks and food at all. This is almost criminal! Yes, you could buy drinks and food but why you pay almost double price to fly with this company? Their advertisement is fraudulent. On this journey we also flew from Abu Dhabi to Muscat with Oman Air. The flight was only 60 min. long and complimentary drinks and luncheon was served. Than we flew from Muscat back to Dubai with Swiss Air. On this only 50 min. long flight complimentary water and snack was served. The inbound flight with Emirates was not bad, Airbus 380, little wider seats and little more legroom, complimentary drinks and food. Nothing really great but OK. I complained to Emirates about our outbound flight without any successful result. They wrote me that their partner company should have same standards and that they are looking forward to see me on board again. I felt offended! I would never fly with Emirates again.",0
"A recent experience flying with Spirit Airlines from Baltimore to Los Angeles for someone who moves around in other countries quite a bit left me dumbfounded. How can such an airline stay in business regardless of the low frill business model in the current age that we should be demanding more and expect more for our buck. Rude and not very well trained check in staff, including the supervisors. The check in operations at the Airport was very mediocre at best. 5 hours flight with no entertainment on board not even a wireless one that you could connect your own device. Hardly any leg room across standard seats. They charge fees for checked in luggage to include carry on hand luggage. Should we not be demanding more from our Airlines in terms of service, offering and features? Are we going back in time, depriving travelers of essential services to enrich shareholders and executives. I got to my destination and find out that one of my suitcases was missing still as of 4 days later. What an Airline, incompetence, lack of service, unbelievable service.",0
"I would like to thank China Southern Airlines for bringing me a very pleasant long trip. The trip made me experience the warmth of home and the staff was very professional and welcoming, assisting me in the security check, helped me with my luggage. It made my trip feel more comfortable.  I will continue to support China Southern Airlines' service and will recommend it to my friends and family.",1
"Worst seat I have had in business class over last 30 years of regular travel. The cushion was so thin and worn, you could feel the metal of the frame digging into you. There is a large wedge cushion that is to be used when you lower the seat into an angled bed, so I sat on this cushion when not lying down. But then when lying down the metal frame was very noticeable again when using the cushion at your feet. For the price it was a disgrace in term of comfort. They say the worst business class is better than any economy, but I have to say this came close, I'm sure some good airlines economy would have been as comfortable. I know Malaysia Airlines are looking to change, but they need to, I felt robbed in terms of value for money.",0
"Seattle to Boston. Customer service is awful. The app is down, the flights are delayed. People keeping saying gate s7 and gate s15. The chat associates are useless and have no idea about flight times or boarding info. We are getting updates to JetBlue's mess from Delta associates. So I have great things to say about Delta. Amazing customer service very helpful. Meanwhile jetblue associates are MIA. Delta is calling for a jetblue associate and none are coming over to the gate. These are the most useless people I've ever encountered. Next time I'm flying with Delta. Jetblue are incompetent.",0
"Bangkok to Copenhagen. In Thai Airways premium economy you get a wide seat, a lot of leg room, and this makes the extra money for premium economy worth it. Other benefits are separate check in, lounge access, and the food was surprisingly tasty. But  for 11 hours, it's about the seat. If you can afford it, do it.",1
"I would like to say thank you to the flight attendants in Flight HU7976 , March. 10 2021 from Toronto to Beijing. Thank you all for bringing us home during this special time and the kind service. Keep up the good work and be safe.",1
Mid July I flew from Frankfurt to Toronto. I had booked my flight in what they refer to as Comfort Class which would generally be in between economy plus and business class on major airlines. The flight was disappointing as they changed aircraft and the alternate plane was not equipped to offer Comfort Class. This was the second time this happened to me with Condor on the same route the year before. The negative rating is owed to the fact that the comfort provided did not match the comfort booked. Condor had chartered the plane from a British charter provider. The staff was very friendly. The food was adequate for economy class but inadequate for an elevated service class. Their customer service department is completely unresponsive.,0
"Madrid to Lyon. Our flight was cancelled because reasons that was not fault of the company, however the way the personal of Easyjet managed the situation was so bad. They made us wait 30 minutes online, then 45 minutes more, then board the plane, one hour more, to finally go out the plane, flight cancelled till next day. 2 more hours waiting online in customer service to get a hotel to rest that night like the personal promised us... false. Then they said, get your hotel and easyjet will refund. It was 1 am. A lot of people like me, we could not get a hotel at that moment, so we spent the night in the airport. Then, the personal of Easy jet promise us that we will receive a compensation for this problem, if we write a claim. I did, Easyjet said they can not give money for this situation. I can understand that sometimes Easyjet can have unpredictable situations, the problem here was the way the personal managed the situation. It was like they played with us and with our time. Wait here, now here, wait there...you will get a rest...false. Definitely my first and my last time with easyjet.",0
"As long everything is smooth its good airline, but if any small bump, like delay, cancelation, mistake in charge etc, they are the worst. No one to talk to, even when at the end you do reach some one they push you of, no refund, no service. you can be stuck in middle of no where because you dont have who to talk. Don't use them. Better take airline that a bit less comfortable but you know that if anything wrong they will help you!",0
"We got 14 people ready to go on this flight with 3 kids and one toddler. Took 5 hours to leave house with kiddos Plus another 2.5 hour delay at DFW. Then flights cancelled because ""the pilot went over hours"". Thats not the worst part, then they say we can't and wont rebook you at the gate or the check in terminal with sun country or any other airline, you have to call and number. 8 people in our group called, on hold for over 2 hours, gave up and went home. Lost 9 hours, a trip to Mexico, 21 total wasted days of paid time off, and couldn't get to Mexico because of there absolutely terrible service. I talked to the manager at DFW airport myself and he said what do you expect from a low budge airline. I told him at least help us rebook and he said they dont do that.",0
Portland to St Louis. I'm happy I see for myself about things and not always go by reviews. Sun Country was great to fly with to and from my destination. Staff was friendly and provided good service both directions. Sun Country was very accommodating with my luggage that should have been checked. Helping me put it overhead because it was too heavy. Sorry Sun Country won't do that again. I was able to move seat because the plan wasn't full and I really enjoyed have my own row.,1
"Atlanta to Austin. I was travelling alone for the first time ever, and as someone with high anxiety this was a major deal. The flight attendants were super nice. When i casually mentioned it was my first time alone and i had already gotten lost in the airport, they made sure i was okay and one gave me one of those pins with wings! I know theyre meant for little kids, but it means a lot to me and i wish i had gotten her name to properly thank her.",1
"Have flown Middle East Airlines on my recent trip to Beirut, Lebanon. It was from Geneva Int'l to Beirut Int'l airport. Boarding was processed without any zone or by seat numbers so found it a bit crowded and disorganized. Once onboard, found the aircraft looking quite fresh and new. The cabin crews were overall pretty friendly. Seat pitch and room was quite generous. Departure and arrival was quite punctual and on time. Lunch was a fully hot meal and they were excellent quality. Overall I thought the airline offered good products in terms of both hard and soft product side. I would not hesitate to fly MEA again the future.",1
"Overall, a very good flying experience with IndiGo. Flights on time. Boarding experience good. Airplanes clean inside, and cabin crew responsive to requests. Overall, a very well functioning LCC which meets my expectations.",1
"Guangzhou to New York. Hassle free check in, and staff more than happy to assist you. I sat in Premium economy, and the attendants were professional, friendly, and responsive to needs.  The food, it is airline food but slightly better quality. When I went to retrieve my luggage, premium economy luggage was one of the first to be delivered. Overall great service, the planes are new and immaculate, and very comfortable for a 15 hour flight.",1
"Berlin to Madrid with Iberia Express. Very efficient boarding, the crew were making space in the overhead stowage and accompanying passengers to their seats which is very rare in Europe. The flight left Berlin late on a Friday evening most of the passenger were grumpy but the cabin crews have been smiling throughout the flight paying attention to small details. Definitely a great low cost experience.",1
"Flight cancelled by Qantas and still no refund 8 weeks later. I've complained twice with zero communication. This company needs to reigned in by the government, they are scamming people and breaking the law by stealing money.",0
"The service was bad, the staff was very rude. The seats did not lean back and they had separated me and my brother and niece from sitting together. I would never fly United again.",0
"Worst flight ever! First off no entertainment at all not even charger port not even a usb plug.! The seat was so uncomfortable and I had a preferred seat? I was sore all over from that flight. The snack part annoyed me, when am flying to Jamaica with a air bistro voucher it's a meal and 2 snacks but, when am flying back to Toronto it's a meal and 1 snack for the same price. I am in shock that any sun destination you pick with Air Canada you're stuck with Air Canada Rouge. Absolutely terrible. The staff was cold and stand offish. Never again will I fly this airline.",0
Five hour delay on way out to Monastir from Manchester no explanation or apology given. No flight details given by captain the attendants were surly rude and unhelpful. Flight home on time but filthy dirty. All in all a horrible experience and by far the worst airline that I have had the misfortune to travel with.,0
"Worst airline experience of my life. Alitalia workers were on strike when we landed in Rome from Olbia, Sardinia, and no one had bothered to tell passengers before we checked our bags to embark. We were told we could not have our luggage back due to the strike, and that it would be sitting on the tarmac for days. We had a flight home to Toronto the following day and did not have days to wait for our luggage. The staff was incredibly rude and unconcerned with the situation they had imposed on their customers. We have ZERO faith we will ever see our luggage again, which almost a week later is still sitting at Fiumicino airport with no response from Alitalia to my emailed inquiries about when we will have them returned to us or receive reimbursement for the lost items.  They are chaotic, rude, and will not be accountable for any costs they impose on you.",0
London to Zurich in Economy class. Flight was 45 minutes delayed as always when I use Swiss to travel to Zurich. The cabin was not air conditioned for at least 30 minutes after boarding and it go hot like a steam room. The plane was a A321 with new seats which are extremely uncomfortable. Not an enjoyable experience at all.,0
"Cluj Napoca to Vienna, and I found an outstandingly cheap TAROM ticket for this flight. Aircraft was clean and in good shape. Cabin crew friendly, attentive and helpful. Flight was fully booked, warm breakfast served. Pilot informed about the short delay, which didn't create any inconvenience. ",1
"After arriving in Victoria and driving over 5 hours to Tofino for a 3 day trip , I was informed that my return flight to Edmonton was cancelled. I called their customer service line and waited for 2.5 hours and then my call was dropped. I find it hard to believe that a company so inept is still in business. I will never fly Swoop again. Thanks for ruining my vacation!",0
Flight cancelled due to ice storm in Portland. Chatted with multiple agents to help me get things figured out and was issued a refund. Wanted to shout out Jackie from Phoenix for being a literal angel and being so helpful.,1
"I booked my flight from Chennai to Delhi in February, travel date March 21st. 4 tickets including 2 kids. Because of coronavirus I asked to cancel my ticket. But they told me cancellation charges will apply. This critical situation also they not waive the cancel charges. Return flight I booked with IndiGo, they waive the cancel charges and refund full amount.",0
We used Blue Islands for the first time a few days ago and certainly will be using again. Not only were the fares considerably cheaper than other airlines the complete package from booking online to arriving at Jersey and return to Southampton was so professional. The cabin crew on both flights were first class nothing was too much trouble for them their attitude and appearence gave a confident and professional air.,1
"Tallin to Riga, this specific flight ran rather smoothly. As you would expect from a flight that is only 30mins. No problem with boarding. No real issue of note.",1
"Worst airline service possible. Left me waiting at BWI for hours and the staff take their sweet time showing up, holding passengers up and are extremely rude. The aircraft itself is so uncomfortable but you get what you paid for. Will never fly with Spirit again.",0
MAN to BKK via AUH and return. Generally faultless service. Staff polite yet not too intrusive. Drinks offered on boarding with offer to request cruising drinks and menu although an anytime menu is available. I slept well on most flights. AUH to MAN delayed with little information given the lounge staff just kept topping up my champagne glass. Flight delay caused by a child misbehaving. Amenity packs have improved. Chauffeur service excellent.,1
Nadi through to LAX. Staff members were not interested in customer service nor did they smile at boarding passengers. After a relaxed safety briefing I attempted to use the inflight entertainment many of the televisions did not work. The aircraft was extremely cold and seating area was very cramped. Many passengers became quite alarmed when the air conditioning vents started leaking large amounts of water people had to move seats to avoid getting wet. Furthermore the meal was a cold hot dog bun with shredded chicken and grated carrot. Staff were arrogant unhelpful and seemed to be busy discussing issues in the corner.,0
6am flight was delayed until 7am which made us 10 minutes late for our connecting flight and they wouldn't even keep the gates open for us when they knew our flight was late. The next available flight was at 7.45pm. we got put on standby for a 12.45pm and a 3.00pm flight and couldn't get in on those. So we patiently waited for our 7.45pm flight then that flight got cancelled. We then proceeded to customer service and they said they couldn't do anything for us. Couldn't even pay for a hotel for us even though the next flight they could put us on was 3.30pm the next day. Do not fly United they do not try to work with you and they are very inconsiderate.,0
"Hurghada to Prague, This is the worst airline for customer service. My flight got delayed from Hurghada by 1 hour 30 mins to Prague which made me miss my connection to Manchester to Prague. No explanation tried telling them on the plane that I am going to miss my connection but no help what so ever. Anyways go to the airport with 20 mins gate closing check already closed would let me on board due to luggage with 2 young children and wife. Went to they customer service desk, no help or supports. I would not recommend this airline.",0
"Wonderful service while flying on Emirates. Clean planes, good food, and, wonderful crew. My flight from Dubai to London on the A380 was a wonderful experience. I would highly recommend this flight.",1
Terminal was overcrowded plane was full no movies no snacks not even water rough 5.5 hr flight. Seat belt sign on the whole time discouraging bathroom breaks especially for older people.,0
I travelled with my quadriplegic nephew to Kunming China and our experience on the ground at the airports Kunming and Guangzhou were the worst in all of my travels. My nephew is just under 2 meters tall in Kunming the wheelchair China Southern provided to get my nephew from the check in desk to the aircraft was too small for him to fit in so he was allowed to use his chair to the door of the aircraft we had to carry him onboard and as he is so tall this was extremely difficult. When we got him onto the aircraft the airline staff said they could not check his wheelchair all the way to Sydney we would have to claim the chair in our transit airport Guangzhou and then re check it in to Sydney. After trying to argue the point for 1 hour and delaying the flight we had to agree as I feared they would not allow us to fly. In Guangzhou we had one of the staff help us again we had to carry my nephew off the aircraft put him into a wheelchair that he didn't fit in. The airport was so hot and we had to rush so much to find the chair at baggage collection go and check the chair in to Sydney and instead of the chair being taken by staff and put on the aircraft we had to wheel the chair with us all the way on to the aircraft and then the staff there put it into the luggage area. The flight was delayed because of us again. I would never travel with them again.,0
"At 7.54 am on the day of travel whilst driving to London Heathrow I received an email advising my flight had been cancelled. I was offered an alternative flight with American Airlines which I had no alternative but to accept as I must travel today. I was flying to LA to see a family member who is end of life. The American Airlines desk downgrade my cabin from premium economy to economy. Tried 3 times BA provide telephone number, total useless, no help, given me wrong email address for sending my complains given to me in the email. I have been a BA frequent flyer for decades and have been a loyal customer. I now find I am travelling 11 hours in Economy without even the possibility of a refund let alone an upgrade. This is completely unacceptable. What has happened to this company? I have had better treatment from Ryanair.",0
"Flight AZ0074 from Rome to BCN. 14.11.2022. Worst airline in Europe? Maybe. They took cabin luggage from almost all non Italians and put them down in the carrier with the excuse that the airplane is full. Above that, all luggage were thrown from the entry level of the aircraft to the airport ground, this is the reason a lot of them appear broken. No respect. No dialog. Very sad that Alitalia ended up like this. Will never fly ITA again.",0
Great airline and probably the best I've been on. The food for purchase onboard was delicious and a bargain for the price. There was a lot of legroom and the cabin staff were top class. Thomas Cook Airlines will be my preferred airline in future trips.,1
"I traveled from Athens Greece to Sophia Bulgaria by Ryanair and due to internet issues I could not get the boarding pass. At the airport I was denied to travel and was forced to pay 55 Euros to get the boarding pass. This was a big blow and jeopardized my traveling budget too. I have travelled to more than 35 countries with almost all the airlines, but this happened for the first time. This is clear cut loot and black trick for Ryanair to make money. It is mandatory by the airlines to provide boarding passes online or offline. But this was the most bizarre experience. I have decided not to travel this airline again who squeeze money from the passengers, which is their right when they by the airline tickets.",0
"Cancun to Baltimore via Ft Lauderdale. Spirit is a joke! Highway robbery, will never fly Spirit again. Will not go on vacation if Spirit is the only option. Literally left us stranded for 3 days.",0
"Terrible service. Flight cancelled, offered the option for a refund either to Wizz credits or to cash. Neither have been given, when I enter all of my details the box to submit claim remains greyed out. No customer service options, as 'All our agents are busy at the moment'. Every minute on their website feels like a scam. Not worth booking with them, the stress involves outweighs the holiday.",0
"This was a disaster. We were stranded in Coron for 24 hours due to mechanical issues. The real problem was that the staff made no effort to help the passengers or give us any information. At first they tried to assure us that the plane was just delayed a bit, but when the later flights started leaving and we were still stuck, everyone started to line up for answers. The staff hid. One guy was ill and needed to get to a hospital, while many others had onward flights in Manila, and still the staff hung around, doing nothing. By the following day, most people gave up and got flights on Philippines Airlines. We are still fighting to get reimbursed for the flight that never happened, but I'm not counting on that happening any time soon. Best to avoid Cebu Pacific if you have any other options at all.",0
I travelled from London to Jo'burg and back on the Airbus 380 and had mixed experiences. On the way out I was in Premium Economy and was pleasantly surprised by the spacious seat and window locker and slept well. The return in Business was a different matter. I was truly shocked by how many seats had been crammed in the uncomfortable narrow seat the lack of privacy and having to climb over passenger's feet to vacate my seat. All this at a premium price. Shocking. The cabin crew were faultless and were only too aware of passengers' views on the cabin! Never again.,0
"Toronto to Gatwick. Cannot say enough good things. Easy check in, on time flight, clean aircraft, super crew and incredible price. Food was really good for a discount airline meal.",1
"Honolulu to Manila. Premium Economy was pretty good. The seats are a little bit wider and they recline a little bit more than regular economy. Food portions were greatly reduced from past flights. The food quality is still very good, but the quantity is much smaller. Also, some passengers were not offered bread rolls for some reason. The flight was very smooth and nice, which is kinda normal for this Jan. time of year. And as usual, the crew was outstanding and professional",1
"Absolutely horrid experience, terrible customer service. Lost Luggage for more than 3 Months. Don't ever waste your money with Alaska Airlines. Alaska Airlines lost our 3 bags on December 22, 2022. It's been 3 Months, and nothing has been done. We filed a claim in person and online, followed up in person, and have spent many hours on the phone every single week for the last 3 months only to be mistreated and to hear that Alaska Airlines don't take responsibility for their acts. My Family and I were left without clothes, lost many valuable Personal items and expensive gifts bought for Family members. We trusted our luggage to Alaska Airlines, paid for Trip Insurance, have the Baggage Claim tickets, and still are getting no help and being treated as we don't matter.",0
"London to Doha. Thank you Qatar Airways for your wonderful, comfortable, luxurious and respected service. Thank you for being professional in selecting distinct cabin crew.",1
"I regret and will never fly this airline again. The customer service sucks. By the way the phone number in Orlando Florida lost baggage claim won't ring, you have to call the Atlanta phone number and then the person in Orlando will just hung up on you.",0
Vancouver to Toronto and back. Was an excellent experience right through from check in to landing. Very professional crews and caring. I was travelling with a 17mth old who is teething so was in discomfort. The crew were always checking up on us as well as they tried to accommodate us to a better seat so our son would be comfortable.,1
"Delhi to Chennai. Spacious seats, early boarding and on time departure and arrival made for a positive first impression. My wife, toddler and I flew Vistara because of the higher quality of service and in flight food, because that's one less thing to deal. We were late to the baggage claim belt and Vistara had staff trying to contact me by phone and were even able to contact my family to ensure we got our checked in baggage. What more can one ask for these days. Highly recommended.",1
"Checked one bag... when we arrived in Seattle, we were delayed maybe 15 minutes before getting to baggage carousel. Nothing on carousel. Called Sun Country. Took several attempts to speak with anyone. They have our bag, but we can't pick it up until the next day, will you deliver it to our hotel? No. Had to make a trip back to airport the next day to get it. Then, similar experience on return flight. No apology whatsoever. Staff are absolutely incompetent! Would not fly Sun Country again even if it was free!",0
"Logistically this was the worst flight. Was it the most delayed? No. Was the plane uncomfortable? No. But what bothers me about this airline is they made no announcements to the passengers on the plane about the unscheduled delay until asked an hour into the delay. Never flown JetBlue prior to this flight and never will again. Flights can and will be delayed, but leaving your customers in the dark is bad practice",0
Birmingham to Rome. Avoid. Stewardess spilt coffee on me and still charged me for it. I was checked into an emergency seat which was horrendous due to limited space for anything. There is no pocket in the seats in front which is very inconvenient. The seats do not recline. The stewardesses are very inexperienced. No in flight entertainment.,0
"Almost all the AC staff were subpar in their customer service treatment. I remember asking for a tissue on the way back as I was quite sick and the air hostess said she would help after serving the food. So I waited and nothing. I didn't bother reminding her again. I used the restroom. Later on during the flight I had a question and pressed the button and nothing. I understand staff get busy and that's no problem. However, I pressed that button over 5 times throughout the flight and not a single host came to address my inquiry. From the moment we tried to board until the very end, there wasn't a single rep I could give a shout out to. The attitude was aggressive and arrogant. A little mindfulness goes a long way and the staff in my opinion need to significantly up their game. The job isn't merely to serve food on the plane but to make sure all travellers are respected and responded to with basic kindness.  Of course this is just my one such experience there may have been others out there who've had a pleasant experience with this airline.",0
"Terrible! I had my ticket cancelled in May due to Covid. It's October and I keep waiting for the promised refund. I have sent numerous emails and even had an official bank transfer receipt 2 months ago. After not receiving anything for a month I opened a new case. I was asked for all the bank transfer details again because it was obviously not done. I can see I am not the only one. Do not fly with them or TAP Portugal, they are even worse. They do not even answer at all! The only decent airline that refunded me was American Airlines.",0
"Madurai to Dubai. I have multiple times traveled with Spicejet, there is no improvement in service. Each trip is delaying and no delay information is communicated with passengers, Cabin crew aso not responding well with passengers, they fail to serve the basic requirement, even the announcement also not understandable and unclear. Still I am using Spicejet for traveling to Madurai because there is no alternative service available. Please try to improve your operation system",0
Do not fly with Sunwing! We arrived at 3 am to check in for our flight at which time they told us we were delayed by 6 hours forcing us to kill time in the airport on no sleep. There should be notification of such changes this is unacceptable. We finally boarded a filthy plane and thus missed an entire day at our resort. Awful experience.,0
"Washington to Istanbul. The website didn't work for check in, so I called and it was quick on the phone somebody checked me in, but the wonderful thing happened at the airport as we checked in for the flight we are now waiting for. The man at the ticket counter was wonderful, efficient and very considerate for my old parents, also helping fellow agents.",1
I flew round trip on Virgin America from IAD to SFO. What truly pleasurable trip. Love the comfortable seats the entertainment system and the staff. After the abuse I have suffered on several other airlines recently Virgin America is going to be my first choice from now on.,1
"They didn't let us in our connecting flight to Toronto so they rebooked a flight that arrived more than 24h later, our surfboard arrived 3 days later and our return ticket was ""on hold"" so we couldn't take our return flight and they rebooked a flight the next day, so we also missed a working day.",0
"This review applies to three flights Honolulu Los Angeles on a Boeing 767. Los Angeles to Boston round trip Delta One Boeing 757. All 3 experiences were great. Honolulu LA was an internationally configured 767 so the seat was amazing The food was perfectly good above average domestic first class. LA to Boston round trip was an internationally configured 757 with Delta One service. While the layout on the 767 allowed for me to sit alone, the food etc was not quite as good as the Delta One flights. The Delta One 757 offered very comfortable 2x2 seating with upgraded service such as amenity kits..etc. On all flights the attendants were friendly and terrific, the entertainment plentiful and the experiences were all excellent. Delta One is a gigantic step up from Delta first domestic which can feel very cramped. These flights were all great.",1
"Very unprofessional checking at the airport, the representative was so rude, unreasonable and unprofessional. I never saw this kind of disrespectful behavior from airline employees. Also last time the food quality and the whole flight quality was so poor. I prefer to pay a couple of hundred dollars for and get better service, this airline charges you for your seat, bag and food so you have to pay even more than a good airline like Delta.",0
We flew Stansted to Ancona for a few days at the end of September. A lot of the reviews here knock Ryanair but I have to say I was very pleasantly surprised by the service provided. Apart from that awful jingle on landing the inflight experience was fine and the cabin crew polite and helpful. Stansted passenger handling airside is appalling but that is not Ryanair's fault. I will definitely fly Ryanair again as long as it is hopefully not from Stansted!,1
Amsterdam to Delhi. I never got my baggage and the airline staff had no information about it. The staff said I will be contacted on any updates about it but never heard anything from them. They have ruined my whole trip. Customers have to take care of their baggage on their own.,0
We were on a chartered flight taking a group of very special kids to Lourdes in France. Team were so friendly and welcoming. Lovely comfy accommodation clean and spacious. Lovely touch was a special 'package' snack for our VIPs. Thank you Titan.,1
"Ogdensburg to Sanford. Allegiant left my family and I stranded in Sanford for the return flight home. Allegiant's solution was to fly us home 7 days later, which was unreasonable. They played the ""because of the weather"" card so that they don't have to be responsible for us and offered the reimbursement very quickly. There was no issue with the weather at all which was confirmed by our weather regulator. I will never fly Allegiant again",0
"Have been flying Qantas for many years, but really disappointed with the food and the lack of inflight movies or choices. Sydney to Tokyo return and the meals were uninteresting, in particular, breakfast was served in a cardboard box. Surely you can do better than this. What happened to the good food and decent breakfasts from the past. Unimpressed.",0
"Last month, I traveled from JFK in New York to Milan, Italy. I only have good things to say about my experience. First of all, the plane was huge and the seats were comfortable. The food was great, the staff were helpful. There was a huge selection of free movies and music to watch and listen to during my flight. I also happened to leave my handbag on the plane on my way to Milan and I was sure that I wouldn't get it back, but as I was checking in my luggage, a flight attendant approached me with my handbag, asking if it was mine. I was pleasantly surprised. My comment is that on my flights to Milan and back, the wifi and internet did not work at all, but the movies, games, and music on the TV screens worked perfectly, so this didn't impact my experience that much. ",1
April 4 Toronto to Nuremberg via Amsterdam. Old style 2x3x2 seating but comfortable. Staff were first rate. Travelling with my mother who's is 95 and has a serious gluten allergy. Her special meal was adequate my meal was adequate. Meals out of Toronto are always poorer than out of Amsterdam or Paris. Somehow KLM seems to have nicer wines that Air France even though they are one and the same now. Entertainment was good with a side choice of movies and tv.,1
"A terrible experience. We were booked with option plus on TS 704 to fly home from Calgary. Got there early and discovered flight did not exist and no staff anywhere. Eventually thanks to airport staff we found staff who checked us on to a different Air Transat flight later in day. On return our agents discovered that Air Transat had failed to tell us of the change of flight. They offered to apologise but in fact wrote saying they were sorry we were disappointed! Eventually offered to refund the amount we had paid for confirmed seats which we did not get, and months later have still not received the promised money. Really terrible customer experience.",0
"It has been 9 days for the IT department to fix the issue with my booking reference which is only numbers and why would they use numbers for reference when the system doesn't pick up. Every time I called was given a different answer, ""IT department will get back to us within 1 or 2 hours"", or "" They will fix it by tomorrow"". I am not happy with this service, the seats are taken, the luggage price increased and you expect me to pay a higher price for everything when you have an issue with your system. Poor service, definitely don't recommend them, horrible experience with customer support as they are so rude in order to fix the issue and my flight is in a few days still can't book anything.",0
Panama City to Bocas Del Toro. Arrived at the airport an hour before my flight to find out I was switched to a different flight two hours after my scheduled flight. They told me I was informed by email which was a lie. The Air Panama staff acted annoyed and placed me on an imaginary waitlist by literally writing me last name down on a blank piece of paper and told me to keep checking and of course there was no room on any earlier flight every time I checked. I recommend using Copa or really any other airline if possible. I am finally boarding my plane after three hours and I will update if more things go wrong!,0
As someone who is over 6 feet and 220 pounds the only word I can use to describe Air Canada Rouge seating is inhumane. I can live with wireless movies no meals and pay for baggage but I do need a seat I can sit in without skinning my knees. I can honestly say Rouge seating is the worst I have had to endure.,0
Do not book! This airline is selling tickets for false flight. I have been canceled 4 times already since March 23. If you check their website all dates are available to book then they reschedule you and then cancel you last minute. I ended up spending close to 5000USD in canceled flights. They are also saying that refunds will take 6 months.,0
"Wellington to Auckland. I'm writing this review while waiting for my flight. My flight was delayed initially by 1 hours 30 minutes, until staff were ""just"" informed by engineering that they need to run tests. My flight has been delayed a further hour and half, the total delay being at least 3 hours. This is not uncommon for Jetstar at least in New Zealand. The airline often has flights delayed due to lack of preparation to comply with engineering requirements. Had I known earlier that there would be further delays than the initial 1.5 hour delay from the outset when I arrived at the airport at 7am, I could have bought a ticket with Air NZ and arrived at my destination by now.",0
"My flight got cancelled from Istanbul to Amman due to the lack of information for the documents that needed to enter to Amman .. you need a negative PCR test, payment for the PCR test at Amman airport and a Medical Insurance. No staff mentioned ""the medical insurance"" until I got to the boarding, the staff told me I cant travel because I didn't have a medical insurance. If they told me while I was checking in, I would have time to make it and I will travel that day. They canceled my flight at the door and I didn't get any money back .",0
"Awesome hospitality by Air hostess, a member of family had a health issue and she really took very good care of her. Overall experience was amazing, loved to fly with indigo",1
"Terrible experience! They board the plane then tell you there are mechanical issues. How long have you been doing this? Shouldn't this be checked prior to boarding. We are all stuffed in here like sardines, no social distancing whatsoever. I've only had one interaction with the staff, so far so rude. They don't offer drinks.",0
"Do not book a flight with AA if it is a connection flight. This is the fourth time that I have flown with AA and it's the fourth terrible trip. Multiple gate changes and multiple delays and eventually canceled flights, I don't know what's wrong with their aircrafts but they always seem to need work when you are boarding a connection flight. If I hadn't booked a round trip flight I would never fly with them again. I have no plans of flying AA ever again. 1 hour later still sitting at the gate on the plane.",0
"Albuquerque to Chicago. My second time riding with American and it was great! My sister and I booked basic economy. Due to our tickets, our seats were separated. Fortunately, one of the flight attendants saw us talking prior to boarding. She offered us an empty row, so we both can sit together. Also, Inflight entertainment was great since I can use AA website on my phone for free to watch live tv or movies.",1
"Traveled to Dubai for our first anniversary and KLM lost our suitcases including mine and my wife's. 48 hours after arrival still nothing so I took a cab to the airport and got no response. Worse customer service from the KLM office in Dubai as well. KlM said we could buy essentials and send them the receipt with a claim and they will refund us. We received our luggage on the day we were leaving from Dubai, which was 4 days after. It's been almost a year and They still have not refunded anything then ignore emails and whats app messages. I will never take this airline again.",0
I travelled from Sharjah to Colombo on Air Arabia in June. The flight was full but I was comfortable. The flight was about four hours long. I checked in online but my phone failed so got replacement boarding pass at baggage drop. I enjoyed the flight and will fly them again.,1
London to Bangkok. My husband and I travel a lot usually economy and I find economy on Thai one of the best. Boarding went very quick and was well organised. Aircraft was very clean and everything functioning. The food was very good with plenty of soft and alcoholic drinks throughout the flight. Cabin crew helpful smiling and friendly. My husband is quite tall but even he found the seats reasonably comfortable. Entertainment was fine good selection of movies and music. Overall very good experience could not fault on anything and I would definitely recommend.,1
"I've flown with Wizz Air many times, usually between Liverpool and Gdansk, and always been very happy with them. Website and mobile app work fine, and the flights are almost always on time and no hassle. Definitely one of the better budget airlines.",1
"My first time on Air Asia, in terms of value for money you simply cannot better its price and often frequency. Nice clean aircraft, excellent crew, on time and comfortable seats. The pre ordered hot meals are not the best, and often not a lot of western choice, but its ok for a short trip. I honestly don't know how some of the airlines get any economy passengers if Air Asia is on the same route.",1
"I've flown Frontier a handful of times and have yet to be impressed. Today, was the piece de la resistance. I am writing this, while waiting for my baggage having flown from San Diego to Cincinnati. Because I have the time. I've had baggage delays at busy airports, not at airports that are empty, nor have I had them at airports where there is no other baggage to be loaded and sent to the claim. Yet here I stand, after having landed at the airport over an hour ago now, and having been waiting at baggage claim for an hour, to find out. They still have not dropped the baggage.",0
"Manchester to Bangkok via Istanbul return in the last month. All flights were on time. Excellent food and drink service. Lovely staff and a smile on their faces. Great airline, cheap prices, excellent service.",1
EZY137 from Manchester to Belfast. This was my first time flying EasyJet since 2004 and I must say I was highly impressed. Can't fault them on anything. I dropped off my bag without any issues. I had a mobile boarding pass but the check in assistant printed me one nevertheless. It's nice that some go the extra mile. The crew on board were extremely friendly and welcoming. The flight left in good time and arrived 15 minutes early. An excellent and efficient service. I would certainly use EasyJet again.,1
"The staff were rude, abrupt and condescending to me. My food was disgusting and inedible and service was non existent. What happened to Lufthansa when l asked one of them they said Covid changed everything, not good enough. See my photo of breakfast below.",0
"I sought to change my return dates a few times prior to flying. Went on to ""manage booking"" but the webpage led to had ""internal server error"". This was despite several attempts during the few weeks leading up to my flight. At the actual Scoot counter in the airport I was referred to a staff who unconcernedly insisted that all flight changes needed to be done via the call centre. I had to quickly call before to change, and Scoot's call centre had a lot of disrupting options before I was put through. Finally I got the change. If your ""manage booking"" page is down, kindly be upfront and notify customers to call your line first. Secondly, do fix that page. I had much better airline service in Africa when some flight changes were needed, compared to what I got from Scoot.",0
"I have been traveling for the last 28 years on hundreds of flights, but this bad experience takes the cake. I booked a ticket to Lisbon from London via Madrid. They didn't notify me of anything of transit restrictions. The link they provided said there was no problem for passengers in airport transit. I was on the phone calling them for days before the flight to clarify if there was any other restrictions, but the calls was served by answering machines even after hours of trying. At the departure airport in London they denied me boarding citing that as a non Spanish person I could not travel via Spain. No amount of explanation was of help. As one can see from the reviews for Iberia on this forum, it tells its own story. My advise is avoid if you don't want big time problems. I have not even been refunded my ticket money citing some unfounded reasons. They don't even care for the negative reviews according to this forums advise. Its your choice.",0
"Las Vegas to Salt Lake City. I used to fly Frontier years ago but switched to Delta for the past 5 years. I flew Frontier in 2019 and I am blown away by their horrible business model. They are the worst airline there is. Every single thing is an additional fee. Customer service is horrendous, the plane is awful with rock hard seats and they proving nothing! Pay a few dollars more and fly with a different provider!",0
"Atlanta to Newark. I am a mileage plus member and I paid my ticket through my card in order to avoid the check in fee. When I approached the customer service at airport, they made me pay for the bag as their system has incorrect expiration date of my mileage plus card. Very disappointing. After I reached my destination, it seems my bags never left Atlanta and they said I would get my bags by next day afternoon. After 24 hours they has still not located where my bag was. We were in the same clothes for two days. And since this was a holiday for a short time we ended up spending most of our time indoor rather than touring NYC worrying about our bag since we had everything in the checkin bag. I have had another very dissatisfied experience with united. Strongly recommend against flying united.",0
"Flew from London to Jeddah, good flight, the one from London was empty, the food was excellent, seats good and crew polite. The flight from Dubai to Jeddah was however really full, nevertheless service very good and they gave hot towels in economy. The entertainment system remote was touch screen from London though not from Dubai. Great inflight entertainment though. WiFi is slow and very limited.",1
"I had a flight from Seattle to Cancun on this Saturday 08th, 2022 and due health problems I had to cancel I tried to call Delta by phone and the waiting time was about 2hrs 45 min, so I found another way via chatting that at the end of the day it was more or less the same to time to make it possible to have an answer from Delta. After that time the person came to me to tell me that no matter ticket was sold by Delta, the flight would be operated by Aeromexico and they cannot do much in regards of cancelling the flight I told the lady I had to wait more than two hours on line to get such answer? What a terrible service.",0
"Flight 600 from Atlanta to Dallas July 16th and Flight 877 from Dallas to Atlanta on July 18th. I even question why there is a place to write a review on such an unbelievably classless company. The worst travel experience. The flight was delayed 3 hrs in arriving to our gate. The flight was delayed 1 hr after boarding. The flight was delayed yet again at the destination gate. On the flight the flight attendants were very crude and borderline confrontational to paying customers. When I asked for a cup of water the flight attendant responded ""No way this is Spirit Air where you don't get anything for free!"" I understand the principal of a discount airline is to pass down the savings to the customer however to do so at the expense of professionalism is certainly not worth the savings. This was my first and certainly last flight with Spirt Airlines. Take heed and do not fly Spirit airlines.",0
"Chicago to London Heathrow. Don't waste your money buying BA seat assignments in advance! I did that a month ago, at the same time as I made my booking, and paid for an aisle seat of my choice. When I went back one week before my journey, my aisle seat was gone and I was placed in an undesirable middle seat. There was no remedy for this. Five calls over three days to BA connected me to people in Delhi whose only vocabulary was unfortunately, sorry, and just no. I have been deceived, lied to, and put off. I have flown British many times this is absolutely my last time. It is acceptable to make an error, but totally unacceptable to callously make no effort at all to rectify it. Take my advice, choose another airline. I am a OneWorld emerald flyer on AA, flew 200k miles last year, and I can tell good service from bad. British Airways has unfortunately declined badly.",0
"Horrible experience. They charged for everything. Even after I paid for the whole premium pkg they charged again.  Do not fall for the cheap marketing, it will cost you an arm and a leg. Their customer service will not get back to you and you will be on hold waiting, with no response.",0
"We had an amazing flight with Air Canada rouge from Las Vegas to Vancouver on Monday May 9th. The flight crew were truly amazing! Very helpful, friendly and professional. We were amazed when one of them suggested that we might be able to get my 9 year old son to visit the cockpit after the flight landed. It was an amazing experience, and the gave us an amazing experience that none of us will ever forget! It's been a while since we experienced such great customer service and we appreciate it!",1
"Second huge delay in a week. Came to Funchal from Geneva a week ago. Connecting flight in Lisbon left 4 hours late, no crew. Landed in Funchal at 3 in the morning instead of 11 pm. Today, return flight to Geneva, technical problem, plane is not leaving, connecting flight in Lisbon is lost. No idea when we will arrive in Geneva. Maybe not today. Last time I fly TAP. Never again.",0
"The lady at the counter mixed up my boarding pass with another person who's name starts with the same letter, at first i thought thats how they spell my name in Czech, then later when i verified she thanked me for pointing it out and said my name wasnt there on the list as it wasnt expanded as in the passport but was initialed. She asked me to go to another counter and get it changed or verified if it was okay. Lady at the second counter made us wait for like 15 minutes and then even though i was in queue she prioritised another person in the line as he could speak Czech and i couldnt and asked me to give this gentlemen privacy. She made fun of my last name over the phone while getting it verified then verified that it was okay. Of course the flight was delayed by 2.25 Hrs and the gate changed thrice.",0
"Brilliant flight, on time, good entertainment and efficient crew. Food is a little naff but for the fare paid, it was more than adequate. Really can't fault this airline and looking to my next trip to Europe in a couple of months",1
"The check in counter staff were rude and slow, and whenever you ask them to hurry up because you're late to your flight they say you should've come earlier. Jeddah to Sharjah they forced me to pay for extra luggage for the handbag i came with from Sharjah to Jeddah. I came with this bag same bag, same weight, why you force me pay for it? Either you pay or you split the weight into two bags.",0
"Kuala Lumpur to Kota Kinabalu with AirAsia. Poor airline with excessive seat rows and extremely tiny seats. Flights were delayed on both ways with no compensation. Delays were an hour and felt like the delays were somewhat on purpose for the airline to save money. When boarding gates, no personnel came to check details and everyone just stormed into the gate. This is by far the worst experience I ever had on an airline. Only travel on this airline if you like to arrive late to your destination.",0
"My first fly with this lousy airline, last minute flight delay 1st time 1hour 45 minutes, 2 announcement say 2 hours 15 minutes, boarding gate changed 16,18, now last 17 still don't know yet. We choose budget airline to save some cost, but after delay like this more money need to spend at destination place for pay car rental extra money for delay. Very disappointed, not recommended.",0
Gatwick to St Lucia. Great service on this flight. Thank you very much for the cabin and the great cabin crew. Excellent Service.,1
They are always trying to scam you in every single way and their customer service is garbage. On a six hour flight they don't even offer water for free.  I do not recommend this airline.,0
"Dear American Airlines, I want to thank you for being an hour late and making me miss my connecting flight today. I enjoy sitting in a random airport for 8 hours alone waiting for the next flight, instead of having dinner with my grandson I only have 3 days with.",0
Toronto to Keflavik. It supposed to be cheap but they charge for every single thing. It turned out to be very expensive. I don't recommend. Called support due to an issue and they did nothing. Horrible customer service. I had to call many times to get something back. We ended up paying more than any other airline.,0
Flew from Barcelona to Alicante round trip. Everything was fine from Barcelona to Alicante however on the return flight I was told that my carry on bag was 10.5 kilos. The checked bag can only be 10 kilos. I was then told that the bag was to large and would not fit in the overhead binds. The bag fit fine on the first flight. When I purchased this carry on bag it said it was approved for cabin carry on. I was told that I would have to pay 35 Euros and have the bag checked. Very rude check in staff. Next time I will take a train and bus to Alicante.,0
Both flights were changed into a later cheaper one. You don't get your money back. Both flights were also 1 hour delayed. This must be one of the worst airlines flying between Bangkok and Phuket. You can be sure that your flight is delayed for at least on hour.,0
Myrtle Beach to Detroit. Found out flight was delayed by display screen. Spirit never said a word. Asked the attendant at counter why. She told me they had no crew to fly the plane! How can you sell a ticket and not have a crew to fly the plane? Then got a delay email after the plane should have been in the air! Arrived 2hrs late then waited 35 minutes to get a bag. So it ended up costing me an extra day to car parking fee. Got in after midnight and after drive home missed half a day of work! That cost me even more money! All because they cant staff a plane they sold tickets for!,0
Crew were amazing planes nice and clean roomy seats and flights were on time. Food excellent staff truly there for the passengers!. Every one smiles asking for water is not a crime as it is on some airlines.,1
The flight was delayed by 70 minutes. The legroom and the seat is horrible comparing to Bangkok Airways. Also it was a bus gate and they just boarded the all the passengers in 1 bus and was too much people and very uncomfortable.,0
"Terrible customer service, change our flight schedule from early morning to midnight. Instead of finding an option I was asked if I just want a refund. Disregard whether customers has plan on the day of arrival, or has booked a hotel or rent a vehicle, Air Canada can just change the schedule without letting you know",0
I booked on Air Canada in January. They sent me a revised itinerary in March. They then sent another revised itinerary in Late April just before my flight. I checked the time and saw that the seats I had reserved and paid for were correct. I ended up being rebooked by Air Canada on Rouge. It was horrible. There was no legroom. You can't recline the seat more than an inch. There was an entertainment system that required you to have your own tablet but when you went to the app there were no first rum movies. My initial flight was on a different type of plane so my original seats didn't match up and my husband and I had someone sitting between us. When I complained to Air Canada I was told that they can bump people to a lower class ticket than you purchased and they hoped to see me soon on another Air Canada flight. They couldn't understand why having booked Air Canada I was upset being downgraded to Rouge.,0
Our overnight flight from Tokyo Haneda to Sydney on QF26 lived up to the expectation of Qantas business class. We were seated in seats 3A and 3B in a roomy section of the cabin. Service was professional and attentive without being overly invasive. The cabin was prepared for the night flight and supper was served promptly after this. Food was excellent. A selection of Japanese food was offered and was very tasty. Seat is comfortable with plenty of room. Onboard entertainment worked well although I do not watch much of this. The Japan Airlines lounge at Haneda was very good and a shower prior to boarding was vey well received.,1
"Munich to Warsaw via Berlin. Air Berlin was late about an hour at boarding, at departure 2hrs. In Berlin I had to transfer to connecting flight to Warsaw, which was to depart 30 min before the first flight's late arrival. Hustling off the plane, there was no bus to bring us to the terminal, which literally was 15m away. After 5 min, there was a bus to bring us these 15m. Inside the terminal, I was running to catch the next flight. It took about 5 min, just to notice me boarding the plane right next to the one I came in with. After having seated, we were told that we need to wait for another 30min because one passenger did not show up but his luggage was loaded, so it had to be unloaded. About 2h late departure. Arrived in Warsaw, I was told my luggage did not arrive, because there was too short time in Berlin to transfer my luggage. Air Berlin staff knew this already in Berlin, but decided to tell us upon arrival in Warsaw. However, how was there 30 min to unload luggage but not to load transfer luggage? Being left without christmas presents and without any clothes one day before christmas, I was also told that before 2 days after christmas I cannot really expect my luggage. Thank you Air Berlin for ruining christmas. Never again.",0
I flew from Los Angeles to Rome round trip. Talk about a sardine can! I reserved an aisle seat and got windows. Both ways ended up with an oversized man half in my seat. The food was terrible and so were the flight attendants. The flight was also late.,0
"I booked the flight New Delhi to Guangzhou return with China Southern Airlines. The flights were smooth and on time, and the ground staff and the cabin crew worked diligently to help me with the wheelchair service. In the sector from Guangzhou to New Delhi, I didn't know what's the problem with my special meal reservation that I couldn't get my vegetarian meal according to the airline's passenger special meal list. But the cabin supervisor was so nice, she gave me some fresh fruit from the first class and some vegetable and rice from the crew meal. She told me I should make a phone call or click to the official website to reserve the special meal 24 hours before departure. I think the airline should give us a simpler method to help passenger make the reservation with their special meals.",1
"Oporto to Bangkok via Istanbul. Flying to Bangkok to see my father before his operation was going smoothly until I arrived in Istanbul. The flight was originally delayed by 1 hour 50 minutes and kept increasing until we took off almost 5 hours behind schedule. The ground staff had no answer to my questions as to why the flight was late other than it happens often with the flights. Food was served but by the time I reached the front of the line it was finished and I was told 'sorry'. When the flight eventually took off, I was in a seat that was broken and wouldn't recline and the air conditioning was not working properly. I barely slept the entire trip due to stressing about not reaching the hospital on time, and we landed over 3 hours 10 minutes late, with a further 35 minutes before the doors even opened. I am so disappointed as the entire trip from Istanbul onwards was stressful, uncomfortable and there was a total lack of care. The return leg was much better, but I had to make it with a heavy heart. The cabin crew are friendly enough and the food is great, but will I ever fly with them again? I doubt it very much.",0
"I purchased the China Southern Airline ticket for my son from Lhasa to Guangzhou via Chongqing transit. Because my son is only 10 years old, he travelled as an Unaccompanied child. As I was worried, the ground staff explain to me a lot, told all the formalities and that the cabin crew is responsible for special care of him. When the plane landed the next day I received the China Southern Airlines email with photos of my son meals. My son told me a flight attendant was with him, kept asking him about going to the bathroom, taught him a lot of kids flying safety knowledge. I am really grateful to China Southern Airlines.",1
"Doha to Beirut via Amman with Royal Jordanian. I would never recommend this airline. Our flight was delayed in Qatar, and that made us miss our connecting flight from Amman to Beirut. Once we reached Amman Airport the front desk staff told us that we will have to wait for 6 hours in order to connect with the available flight. When we started telling them that this is not an option since we have babies with us, they were very rude, and told us to go decide what we want to do then come back to them. What is worse is that the connection flight was delayed another time for another hour. So we ended up waiting for over 7 hours in the airport with our children. I would understand that problems may happen with flights, but the rudeness I experienced with the Royal Jordanian staff was the worst ever. Moreover, they had no control over their flight details, since it was showing on the screen that boarding started and no one was their to check the passports and tickets of the passengers. It was even showing last call on the screen, and still no one from the staff showed up.",0
I have flown Icelandair for the past 3 years. I flew Seattle to Manchester and returned the same route. I had a great experience. I brought my own food as I learned the hard way how expensive and poor the food is. But not a problem to bring to my own food. I have found staff in Seattle and Manchester to be helpful and friendly. To change planes in KEF instead of Heathrow or Chicago is a dream. Traveling these days is not easy so one needs tons of patience. When I look at what I saved re price compared to British airways it's is a no brainer. The flights were on time and staff were professional but not overly friendly. overall a good experience I will fly Icelandair on my next trip.,1
"It was a pleasure from start to finish flying with Porter. The specific flight was PD403. Tha amenities were great. Wifi free, snacks free. Provided by a friendly professional staff. The booking and boarding went ultra smooth. Helpful and courteous from the get go. Pretty impressive considering it was an almost inaugural flight. I would recommend Porter to everyone. Would like to thank Teyana, Lauren and Chazito. It's staff like that and a more then competent pilot and FO that makes flying a positive experience that you want to repeat. Kudos Porter.",1
"Flight delayed over 4 hours on way from Cincinnati to Orlando with very little communication given as to why. No gate agents able to answer questions. Return flight has been just as bad. Boarded the flight, sat on the runway for over 30 min only to be told there was a light on and we had to return to the gate to have it looked at. Sat on the plane for 20 min and then told the plane needed further looking into. Now waiting in an airport with zero communication as to when a flight may be available. Horrible service. Will never fly this airline again.",0
"Worst experience ever! It was first time flying this airline and it would be my last. First off our luggage left without us, due to a 2 mins lateness but the flight ended up leaving later than scheduled but we were still not let in. We got to Austin through another airline by some few minutes after 10 pm. There was a not a single agent to tell us anything about our luggages. Its been 24 hours and yet no agent is available to tell us where our luggage are. Keys to our apartment and car is in the bag, you call and no one hardly picks up.this is the worst airline they will put you through a psychological rollercoaster. Run away and i mean it, extreme bad services.",0
Porto to Barcelona. My husband is not especially tall average height of around 170 cm. His knees touched the seat in front. How lucky he isn't taller! This travel experience would make us rank Vueling at the bottom of the list. When we arrived at Barcelona the pilot advised we would be disembarking from both the front and rear of the plane. This idea was most appreciated but very short lived. It took at least 15 minutes if not longer for the steps to arrive but pleasingly one bus arrived before the steps.  If we could have floated down from the plane to the ground and into the bus I am sure most of the passengers would have been delighted. A disappointing experience all round.,0
Ho Chi Minh to Chu Lai. Arrive at airport 8am for 10am flight only to be told flight cancelled. And my flight now scheduled for 4pm. This not the first time VietJet Air have done this with the standard excuse that they sent me a SMS 3 days ago to inform me. A search of my texts revealed no such notification. Stuck in HCM airport for 7 hours,0
"Delhi to Lucknow. Horrible airline. The flight landed late, and on top of that all the passengers were made to stand in the shuttle for half an hour. When passengers refused to keep standing inside the flight any longer, the ground staff started wasting more time loitering about the airline paying absolutely no attention or them. This was the worst experience I have had with any airline.",0
"The flight with Royal Air Maroc was average. My seat wasn't clean.  Unfortunately, the airline lost my suitcase. I made a loss report and a list of valuables. The airline does not respond to more than 40 messages. Inadequate customer service. Unfortunately, I am stuck here with damage of 1,500 euros and had no clothes etc. for the entire holiday.",0
We also flew from Belfast to Verona on the same flights as Stephen Bradshaw below. The facts are all the same as below we were travelling with a 4 year old with special dietary requirements and had not planned to spend over 10 hours in the airport. The most pleasant part of the flights was the return flight home with Air Malta who had to rescue us! We even had running water.,0
Warsaw to Abu Dhabi via Berlin Tegel. This airline has awful customer service when things go wrong. On June 30 our 21.50 flight transfer to Abu dhabi got cancelled until 16.00hr the following day but it actually took off even later by 2 hours. My wife and I arrived in Abu Dhabi 20 hours late minus our checked in cases. We filed a lost luggage report. We filed 2 complaints on Air Berlins site and tried to find out luggage on their tracer but nothing seems to work. The number they gave us didn't work and the pir number finds no match. We know our luggage is sitting in a store in Berlin. We've sent the baggage tags which the checkin should have changed for the delayed flight to Abu Dhabi but they told us to keep the old ones. We have been trying for days to contact Air Berlin to no avail as have Etihad their partner from Abu Dhabi. No contact at all. I've set up a facebook group to share their tales of woe and Air Berlin threatened to block me on their social media for doing so. Inflight service is fine but their ground staff and customer service are the worst I've encountered in hundreds of flights with different airlines. They've lost my custom and my wife's.,0
"I was not allowed to board this flight because the Hawaiian Airlines representatives at the Honolulu Airport refused to recognize my US passport, which listed my name as given name first, then family name, as matching a reservation made in the Asian way, as last name first followed by given name. If Hawaiian Air wishes to continue offering flights to Asia, it needs to educate its staff about alternatives to the way names are listed in the US. Much of the world recognizes the last name first. Further, the woman at the counter was nasty, rude. I demanded to see her supervisor, who was unaware of naming conventions. For international flights, I would not recommend this airline.",0
"The ground service was amazing, who helped me a lot before my flight. During the flight, flight attendants were so helpful. The same was at the arrival destination, there were a number of ground attendants on the airport to show us the way. Thank you for the lovely flight!",1
Miami to Barcelona via Lisbon. The worst airline I have ever been in and the worst assistance to people. Our plane from Miami was delayed so we got here late and when we were trying to get in to the plane they told us we couldn't because the plane had left. We had to wait over 12 hours in an airport the whole day.  I was with my 4 kids for over 18 hours at the airport and they messaged me saying the flight was even more delayed. This is beyond disrespectful and embarrassing.,0
Fokker 50 from Perth to Geraldton and Geraldton to Perth. Great service by cabin crew food provided was great. The disadvantage of Skywest flight right now is its delay. All my flights were delayed but mainly due to the small terminal of the airport. In addition the flights on this flight is very expensive due to lack of competition.,1
"The flight attendants are rude and not courteous at all. They said on both flights that their credit card machines were broken and only accepted cash for drinks. I am 5'7"" tall and my knees were almost touching the seat in front of me I feel bad for anyone taller! This is the worst airline I have used and will never use them again. The planes are old. I rode in the big seats on the way to my vacation and they are old and look like they never get cleaned. Pay the extra money and use a different airline!",0
"I have been trying to get a reimbursement of my tickets booked for October 2020 and am still trying to get a resolution! 5 months later and numerous phone calls to be told that it is being processed, but have not received anything yet. I have started sending emails, and have been bounced around to every department that they have. I finally received an email today July 19 2020 stating that my ticket was not refundable! Nowhere on my documentations does it state that it is non refundable, in fact when speaking with the gentleman who booked our flights he stated that we could cancel and the fee would be 75.00 euro. I have been given in correct information from just about everyone I have spoken to.  I have requested on numerous occasions to speak with a supervisor to be told in the email that they can not contact my by phone. I find that it is interesting they can request payment immediately but I'm waiting 5 months for funds to be returned. They have not offered any solutions, just a flat statement that my ticket is non refundable. I am writing this as I sit on hold which has now been for over an hour! Do not fly with this company, they do not disclose the truth, will not answer questions, ignore requests for information.",0
"Overall excellent service and experience. Planes were clean, food was savoury, staff was very courteous, flights were on schedule. Highly recommend to anyone who wants an amazing experience, definitely the best airline IMHO.",1
"Shenzhen to Beijing. Staff at the check in counter was very helpful and friendly. An employee accompanied much together to the Gate and then to boarding. All in all, friendly, helpful and courteous staff at China Southern Airlines.",1
"Tampa to Seattle. We can't print out the boarding pass through the machine. We were told to go to the counter. The lady at the counter refused to print the boarding pass with my confirmation code. She requested all the family to physically be at the counter. I have explained my parents are old. I prefer not to ask them to go up and down the stairs. But the reason she gave is that you are pretty early, they have enough time to move to the counter. I am shocked by this kind of lack of sympathy for the senior people. It is Alaska's fault that the machine can't print the pass, but my parents need to pay for that fault. Is this fair?",0
I have travelled many times with Ryanair and never had problems. If you keep to the terms and conditions on the web site you have no problems. Ryanair are the cheapest and best of low cost airlines.,1
The flight from Miami to Cancun was 1 hour delayed. The flight from Cancun to Miami 2 hours delayed. Does this airline fly without delay? Never. In the airplane was freezing cold.,0
2 of my children flew and bags were on another flight. Checked in 2 hours prior to departure. Unacceptable. Family members flew on to Omaha and their bags were lost as well. Delta get it together.,0
"Flew Vueling Airlines from Prague to Barcelona. Here's the thing. If you are like me and seek cheap flights, this is not the way you want. Terrible service, terrible mess in the airplane, terrible everything. Not to mention that the flight was delayed by an hour with no excuse. Just don't do it.",0
"I flew Rwandair from Libreville to Johannesburg via Kigala, at the end of August 2015 from LBV to JNB, and was very disappointed. The flight LBV to KGL without any problem but when I reached Kigali, to my surprise the ground staff told me to show my vaccination book. I told them that the ground staff from origin did not tell me that I needed to carry my vaccination book. The ground staff told me to stand aside. They agreed that ground staff from origin should have asked it to me as a requirement to travel. I then asked them to find me a solution and suggested that I would agree to get the yellow fever vaccine again at Kigali Airport as long as I could move on with my trip. Their response was that there was no doctor at the airport and I needed a visa to get out of the airport. I told them that I was willing to pay for visa and hotel to stay until the next flight to JNB but they categorically refused to let me out of the airport or to call for a doctor. I finally ended up waiting 22 hours at Kigali airport and Rwandair not offering even a single glass of water. They kept telling me that they would provide me with food and even a free phone to call home, but nothing happened. Fortunately I always carry my credit card and could satisfy my thirst and hunger. Finally, they flew me back to Gabon and told me that my ticket was lost. They treated me as a refugee, keeping all my documents all the way to LBV. When i reached LBV, I complained to the ground staff and to the station manager, but until now I did not get any call or mail. I have never been treated like this before. ",0
"Just flown Dublin to Bodrum direct. Plane was quite busy and I'm delighted Ryanair are doing this flight all year round. 2 minor complaints. We were herded like cattle on the stairs leading out to the plane for quite a time. Hard going when you are old and ill. And we were 40 minutes late taking off so incurred extra expense regarding our booked taxi. Other than that, attentive crew and lots of smiling faces. Ryanair are the best.",1
"I flew on EK088 to Dubai for my connecting flight back to Singapore. The aircraft arrived on time. However, due to engine problems, our flight was delayed for 3 hours and I could tell that many missed their connecting flights. At that point, the airline and the ground staff settled the problem efficiently and provided passengers with refreshments. No one was desperately asking for reasons and were in an orderly manner. Unfortunately, I missed my connecting flight to Singapore. The airline booked me on the next available flight and offered me free accommodation in Dubai airport. ",1
Flew Singapore to Phuket as part of my Singapore airlines flight. Aircraft was an A320 very comfortable. We had a spare seat next to us as the flight wasn't very full. Flight time was just over an hour had a full meal which was one of the best airline meals I have had. Spicy chicken and fried noodles! Overhead monitors but didn't watch as I had my iPad! Beautiful approach into Phuket flying over Phang Bay! Rate the airline highly and is a true image of its parent company Singapore Airlines.,1
"Los Angeles to Mumbai via Beijing. I booked my tickets with Air China recently. Everything went well, I could make the payment. They charged my credit card and issued me a ticket. A day later, they sent me another email which reads the following. ""Dear Customer, After a system validation, we found that your ticket has not been issued successfully however you were still charged for the ticket fees. To avoid any loss, we have refunded your ticket fees. It will take approximately 2 to 3 weeks for the payment to be posted to your payment card account. We apologize for any inconvenience. For any questions, please contact a local branch of Air China."" Now what does that mean? Because of Air China, I didn't book my ticket with any other airlines and now prices are up everywhere. Air China must take responsibility of this.",0
Agent was very rude and disrespectful. He got upset and threw my luggage. I was denied a Manager and the Supervisor stated that Corporate management wouldn't talk to customers even if she did call. They had no concern about damaging my belongings nor any remorse for throwing it. It was clear that no disciplinary action would be taken against agent. It was like the behavior was condoned. American Airline service was a complete horror show and even if the airline ticket was a dollar I wouldn't fly again. As I sit in this airport awaiting board all I can do is wonder about my luggage praying that they don't do any further damage to my belongings or purposely lose it. Supervisor threaten me and said if I posted on the internet I would never fly with American Airline again although I plan on never flying with them again.,0
"We flew Rex from Sydney to Melbourne. The check in staff were very pleasant and friendly. My wife has mobility problems and the check in staff gave my wife a wheel chair. The customer service staff member, moved our booked seat to one nearer the front of the aircraft. Boarded as priority, and received a warm welcome from cabin crew. The interaction by the cabin crew was absolutely fabulous. For a budget airline REX could teach a thing or two too other airlines especially customer service.",1
"Indianapolis to Fort Lauderdale. The worst flying experience of my life. We have been waiting on the plane to take off for an hour and a half. No worries the captain keep informing us that they are ""trying to figure it out."" Thank god for Allegiant. I will never be giving them my business again.",0
"Air India is worst airline. They are just fetching money from its flyers. I reached at window 45mins prior to my flight departure. And they said that boarding is closed. And they cannot do anything with it, and we have to book a new ticket and have to pay full amount. We cancelled our plan to take next flight. But on schedule board it was showing same flight was on boarding stage till 15mins prior to departure. There were more people like us.",0
"I booked a flight form Cape Town to Zurich using Edelweiss Air being aware the airline is the Swiss holiday operator, so I was expecting a mediocre service as you can expect for the price paid and class of market served. Totally to the contrary all was excellent, the plane not only very clean but looking new, the crew friendly and efficient, the entertainment system good with new movies and the food very good with real cutlery and a glass wine glass that enhances taste. The only minus point was the price charged for the alcoholic beverages, but on the other hand, the airline has to make money somewhere and it avoids passengers imbibing in excess. On my future travels I will definitely consider this airline again.",1
"Tel Aviv to Los Angeles via Moscow. By far the worst most incompetent service I have worked with. They will only let you increase your baggage allowance if you request it 36 hours before your flight but it is only a request. This means if they say ""no"", you will not be able to fly with your baggage. There is no security for the customer. I would have been more than happy to add the additional luggage when buying the ticket but I didn't have this option. I explained this to the customer service representative on the phone and he didn't care about it at all.",0
"Life happens, flights are cancelled but to give no accommodation and to have horrible customer service is disheartening. Our flight was cancelled in the morning with no notifications, we were placed on standby, and then given a flight in the afternoon that was cancelled as we were about to board. Everyone we talked to was rude, the people working the counter, the people on the phone. Horrible experience.",0
Rouge is a thinly disguised process of jamming more people into the same space. I am a Super Elite 100k Aeroplan member. I had my first Rouge flight Phoenix to Toronto and the seats are uncomfortable leg room is awful there was one beverage service. I initially booked on AC with my usual aisle. I was moved to window with no notification.,0
"Terrible service! Arrived to airport 6 hours early so I would know for sure that I would make my flight on time and my gate got changed without so much as a notification or email to forward me. Been at this airport for over twelve hours, been rolled twice. Just trying to make it to Baltimore to pay my last respects to my late 94 year old grandfather, the man who started our family! I'm telling you, this is comical! Arrive early and still miss your flight.",0
"Will never buy JetBlue tickets again. The flight was delayed from an overpriced 1.46pm flight to a 10.51pm flight after boarding and departing the plane due to a mechanical issue. After waiting for over 5 hours, I got into a line with virtually every other ticket holder and had my flight changed to an 8.30pm flight with American Airlines. Jetblue offered no compensation for being stuck in an airport through no fault of my own for 7 hours. Even when contacted, they believe that changing my flight was sufficient compensation. To that, I say you going out of business would be fair compensation. I'll be charging back my credit card.",0
"Kathmandu to Dubai in Business class. I was pleasantly surprised with how the chief purser was courteous and kind to all passengers, including my elderly parents. He offered to stow their luggage for them without them asking. The IFE was good with good range of movies to watch on this flight. Wifi was decently priced. I was able to use the inflight charging ports. We were offered a hot meal which was filling and good quality. Snacks were offered prior to arrival. disembarked via a bus and was out in no time! can't fault this airline! Well done Flydubai for providing a good product at a competitive price! I hope they bring back the 737MAX back soon with the flat beds in J class!",1
"This is the worse airline I have had the misfortune to fly. We have flown all over the world and this was both the worst planes and customer service in the world. Our first flight arrived in Newark, NJ. After being delayed over an hour we had to rush to the next gate and the flight was cancelled. With no notice and not even an agent there to give us further information we had to argue to get info and then get a hotel for the night. So there goes one more day. Then the second flight gets cancelled and we were stranded for another night and still no assistance. So now another day wasted day of our 4 day weekend vacation.",0
St Pete to Belleville. We had to change our flight on Allegiant Air. We paid for seats and priority boarding. When we had to switch dates we were promised by customer service agent that we had all of the things and seats we had previously paid for. Our seats were changed and our priority boarding was not on our boarding pass. I went to gate agent at gate and tried to explain what happened but he would not listen to anything I was trying to explain. We paid for service that was changed when flight was changed. A different gate agent listened to what we had to say and in fact verified what we had paid for previously. All we wanted was what we paid for and to be listened to and treated with respect.,0
Every time I have flown American Airlines their flights have been delayed and we end up missing our connecting flight. Horrible customer service. I will never use them again!,0
"If you can avoid this airline, please you will do yourself a favour. The business class is not worth the money, awful seats, zero entertainment options.",0
"My direct flight from Washington DC to Atlanta was cancelled and they gave me a flight that has a connection rout through Newark, NJ for the next day. This flight is now cancelled.we have been waiting 4 hours and there is no further information. I have many things to do in Atlanta, already prepaid, hotel booked and too late to cancel. I will never fly again with United.",0
"Kansai to Singapore on 2nd July. If you like a great dose of uncertainty before you fly, then Scoot is the perfect airline for you! For a 19.35 flight, we found out our flight is delayed 1hr 40 mins!  Before the gates open, we get another surprise delay again!",0
"Cleveland to Punta Cana via Charlotte. We travelled as a family of 8 for Christmas to Punta Cana. Thanks to AA we missed a whole day in Punta Cana because we missed our flight to Charlotte. We missed the flight because we were waiting for staff to bring a wheelchair for my grandmother who cannot walk through an airport. When we got to the gate, staff said the plane was gone and we were 2 min late. Staff even acknowledged that the time stamp on our luggage was an hour before boarding time. We waited an hour for a wheelchair. We told them we could push the chair but they did not allow it. There was only one lady working the wheelchair area. Of course it being the holidays they could not get us to our destination that day. We flew to Charlotte that day but had to stay the night. They gave us 1 room for my grandmother since she needed the wheelchair, but we had to pay for additional rooms. I guess AA thought we could have left an old lady and got on a flight without her. We are a family! We come together and leave together! The luggage was a whole other situation. We had the AA agent check all of our luggage tickets. She ensured us that once we missed the flight our luggage did not go either. Well, my luggage was in Punta Cana without me. Once we made it to Punta Cana only 1 family member's luggage came on the belt! Total disaster and staff had no idea where it was. Everyone elses luggage eventually came and all was good. I am very disappointed in AA, we even tried to get refunds and just cancel the trip. They would not give refunds because they said it was our fault that we missed the original flight. We had travel insurance. This is the short version of what happened. The misinformation from AA agents in Cleveland, Charlotte, and Punta Cana is another story. Never again. Oh no wifi on the plane, but the flight attendants were nice. On the way home, I did have to listen to the flight attendants entire personal conversations because I was sitting in the very last row. That was annoying because I wanted to sleep.",0
"By far the worst experience I ever had flying with an airline. Unfriendly staff in the Hamburg airport. The flight was delay with few hours and as result I have lost the connection to Sofia. After 5 hours of staying in line for their service, I was told that Lufthansa is not obliged to give vouchers for accommodation and transfer due to their fault. In turn I would have to pay everything myself and have the possibility to invoice them to Lufthansa. Very disappointed.",0
"Guangzhou to Kathmandu with China Southern Airlines, flight was full. The crew were efficient and very pleasant and cheerful, and the dinner service was prompt. The staff lifted our luggage into the overhead lockers and even took it down after the touch down. That is a rare and welcome assistance nowadays. The seat was a standard economy class seat, comfortable enough as long as one is not very tall or wide. A small note on advantage of China Southern frequent flyer silver card holders. Even when flying economy, silver card holders can use a lounge at Guangzhou airport, whereas with most of the other airline one must have a gold card.",1
"Detroit to Orlando. Fees are outrageous, staff members not friendly, seats uncomfortable. No in flight drink for purchase only. My daughter also flew the same day was her first time flying alone and was treated poorly. She checked in on her phone hours before departure they said she did not and tried to get her to take a different flight because they said she was the last to check in...2 hours before the flight. I think they were just taking advantage of a young girl because of their mistake. Lost her luggage, thanks for making her first time flying a horrible experience. I will never use this airline again.",0
"Bangkok to Frankfurt. Unfortunately staff was not explaining that we have a fast track at Immigration and security check. Then as our flight was canceled due to technical issues, happens. But letting eco, business and first into a super fully crowded bus after we had to leave the aircraft, was not very nice. Arrived back at the airport they offered the lounge and some more info soon. Nothing happened, we had to approach the desk. After 3 hours in total we had our luggage back. It was a disaster and to leave the unfriendly airport service, we had to go through the immigration again filling out the form again... no one explained. Super friendly at airplane, but horrible overall how we got treated as business passengers.",0
"Probably one of the worst experiences I have had with an airline, with extremely poor customer service, flights delayed, cancelled. Was on flight from Kayseri to Istanbul and meant to proceed to Izmir. Plane delayed 1 hour at Kayseri, they then let us on the plane, but another 3 hour delay before take off. The cabin crew then refused to give water to the customers unless they paid for this. Cabin crew quite aggressive towards the customers. On arrival several hours late in Istanbul, at midnight, the ground staff were unhelpful and aggressive, got to hotel at 2.30am and another flight the next day. Baggage arrive at Izmir and damaged. Have written to the company and no response to several emails.",0
"I took AirAsia AK854 flight from Kuala Lumpur to CNX, it was very empty for this morning flight. The crew provide excellence services and we landed 20 minutes before schedule. A typical flying experience with AirAsia value fare obtained.",1
Darwin to Sydney with Virgin Australia. My mother who is 91 travelled with me on 21st December. The friendly check in staff moved our seat booking closer to the front of the aircraft making easier access for my Mother. We were asked if we needed a wheelchair in Darwin but declined as only short walk. I had booked wheelchair at Sydney airport. We're put on the aircraft first and the air hostesses allowed Mum to use the business class toilet and the wheel hair was waiting in Sydney.,1
"Our flight was rescheduled twice and when we arrived at the airport it was not on the board, we had to ask info desk about gate and check in. Then realized the online ticked they generate for you is not a boarding pass. We had to pay for the boarding passes. So we had to queue to pay the fee and then come back to get boarding passes. The skyup lady who was checking in people was not helpful. We then had to get them from a completely different skyup flight and the only reason we managed to make it was because they were super late.",0
Airport staff refused to relay flight information in English to all English speaking customers. Mexico City airport is poorly labelled and difficult to find your way around. When we asked staff for help or directions we were given different directions each time. Since we has a 12 delay due to yet another flight cancellation we tested this hypothesis on a 7 staff members. When we originally selected our flights to Costa Rica this airline offered the best route. Flight times were great no more than 2 hour layovers and we were to reach our destination in less than 9 hours. By the time this airline finished canceling and delaying all our flights it took us over 30 hours to reach our destination. Total fight time was only 6.5 hours. Plus we were given immigration documentation in Spanish only and told it didn't come in English.,0
Barcelona to Madrid the flight was supposed to leave at 2045 and was delayed with no clear reason and nobody gave all passangers a clear answer of what was happening. Finally the flight took off but at 0200 the next morning and the only reason they gave was 'this is a low cost airline what else can you expect'. The price was lower than other airlines but wasn't cheap.,0
"I had booked flights with Qantas which were cancelled only a week before we were due to fly out. My flights back into Australia were also cancelled! I spent over 12hrs on hold trying to sort it out and whenever i got through to someone i was placed on hold after explaining my issue and the the line conveniently 'dropped out"". Do not trust this airline.",0
"Luton to Lanzarote. We travelled as a family 2 adults and 2 children, our 10yr old child is a wheelchair user and has to have special assistance. This includes taking his wheelchair onboard via an ambulift and lifted into his seat and clearance for a weeks worth of liquid medical feed to be brought on board as well as clearance for a lithium battery charged feeding pump. He also has a specialist chair to sit in the aircraft seat and has to have a luggage waiver letter due to the feed. We were dreading the flight and of all the thing that could go wrong as something always does and has with other airlines. I was particularly worried as this is the first time we have flown with our son on a budget airline. I cannot praise them highly enough, their special assistance staff were great and everything was in place and nothing at all went wrong for the first time ever. Well done Ryanair, so pleased we are flying with you again in April.",1
"United Airlines has always been my preferred airlines until what happened today. The plane was not flown out to San Diego because they had no pilot to bring it there, and they then lied saying it was an earlier flight delay. Luckily, our pilot on our flight told us all the truth. I cannot stand United Airlines as I missed my next flight afterwards because the first flight was delayed around 3.5 hours.",0
"New York JFK to Port of Spain. Horrible, they changed our flight 5 times before we even boarded. The result was a different date and a very inconvenient red eye. No flexibility at all, no refunds at all. Never again",0
Los Angeles to Puerto Vallarta. Went to get on my flight and the flight attendant made me give up my carry on as he said there was no over head space. After I got on the flight it was clear that was not the case. I went back to the gate to get my bag to take back on the flight and would not let me do so since he had already tagged it. I tried to say that did not make sense as it was my bag and if it is with the owner they would not have any issues with me accusing the airline of misplacing my bag. After being extremely rude he then stated okay fine we can put you on the next flight. Uncalled for. Airlines should screen for staff to have better manners. Things like this is why upsetting things happen on planes and people stop flying with those companies. I will say I am now going to avoid American Airlines at all cost.,0
No mobile boarding passes. Had to wait in line for a boarding pass like it was still the 20th century. Made me check in 24 hours in advance whereas with any other airline I would just be given a seat next to my girlfriend. Wifi on flight was good and reasonably priced. Overall would not recommend.,0
"Traverse City to Newark. This is the worst airline I have ever flown. Every time I have flown United there has been delays. The weather is perfect both in my departing city and arriving city. There are no mechanical problems with the plane, but now we are sitting in the runway delayed for 1 hour. They give no explanation for the delay and no compensation Is provided. I am on a very small plane with only 3 seats in a row and no room for overhead storage. This airline should be ashamed.",0
"Rome to Los Angeles. This is by far the worst airline I have ever flown. The flight was fully booked, upon boarding it was very hot in the cabin and smelt horrible. The Economy attendants were rude and impatient! Hours would go by and no one was in the cabin, after 3 hours with no one checking, I walked to the back and asked for water, obviously an inconvenience since the attendants were rude! The seats were very narrow and uncomfortable which is saying a lot since I'm just over 5 ft tall and 155lbs. If you are of any reasonable height, expect zero leg room! I will never fly Alitalia again! Worst experience we've ever had!",0
"Worst airline ever! Delayed our first flight twice and then eventually cancelled it, stuck in Bali another night to only go through it all again the next night and then eventually getting us a flight 4 days later only to cancel that so we had to go with another airline! Absolutely useless!",0
Toronto to Quito via Panama with Copa Airlines. Best flight I've taken in a long time. The staff were all helpful friendly. I enjoyed the fact that everything extra is provided at no charge and the fares were good. Would highly recommend them.,1
I went from Frankfurt to Singapore in a A380. Lufthansa had changed my prepaid comfort seat to a standard seat because of an equipment change. Drinks and food came in the wrong order. No menus were distributed. Staff were not service minded and looked more interested in playing with their smartphones in the gallery. Movies could not be seen with English subtitles. Not the level I expect from Lufthansa.,0
"We have two kids, 2 and 4 year old and they gave us seats 20, 25, 29 and 31! And not willing to resolve this at all. The flight attendant lady was the rudest person in my life. And we did check in two days before the flight and we had normal seats on time of check in, so we were super surprised when got on the plain. Worst flight in my life!",0
"I wrote a letter to Frontier about how their customer service manager at Denver airport lacks the personality and sympathy for people who have been traveling and waiting at airports for half a day. Also if they are going to change gates on travelers, don't depend on a muffled airport loud speaker to notify travelers of something as important as gate changes. Use the monitor at the gate to notify us of important changes. Other reviewers are correct, based on the customer service manager who handled our situation, Frontier really couldn't care less if their travelers spend the night at the airport. Which we did. Frontier's letter to us stated that they came up ""a bit short"" on handling our flight with them. Using the words ""a bit short"" after they changed gates on us without adequate notice is like saying someone on a hunger strike is ""a bit hungry"". That letter truly shows they have no clue on how to work with the public. Nor do they really care. Well maybe ""just a bit"". Now is the time to use social media to voice our dismay on this airline.",0
"NO social distancing, jammed in to a very full plane. Masks were supposed to be worn, but some people took them down whenever they wanted to speak. Very disappointed in this airline that I have been a frequent flier on for years.",0
"Doha to London Heathrow in December 2016. Best Economy class ever flown. Seats were comfortable and in flight entertainment was great. We were on row 50 as we had an infant with us, the leg room was good for economy and near to the rest rooms. Service and staff attitude was excellent. Breakfast was okay and probably on par with Emirates.",1
We travelled from Southend to Malaga 24th December 2013. What a wonderful experience we even sang carols. Great staff. We cannot praise the whole experience highly enough.,1
"Riyadh to Islamabad. Worst airline with stupid policymakers. Lost my debit card and they didn't accept any other proof for verifying my ticket that was already purchased. Showed them the online transaction, proof of card replacement, my national identity, proof of blockage of card and everything. Yet they didn't let me fly and cancelled my flight 1.5 day before the flight. I had to take a new booking from another airline which cost me triple because I had to book on 1 day notice. Never fly with this useless airline.",0
My husband's father passed away 2 days ago. We scrambled to get him on a flight that wasn't too terribly expensive and would get him there in an expeditious manner. He flew from LAX to SFO. The plane he was supposed to be on in SFO had mechanical difficulties. They brought in another plane from Vegas. This second plane had problems as well. It took an additional 5.5 hours for him to get on his way to his family.,0
"Southwest Airlines has terrible customer service! For the longest time, I thought otherwise until my recent problem. I received an email in May notifying me my points were expiring July 1st. I called for details and was told I needed to book a flight with points by the 1st, but could fly after that date. After finding flights, I tried booking. I was told the prior information was incorrect and I had to fly before July 1st. It was June 21st. I called customer relations as I was making my decisions based on their employee's statements and already booked the other leg of my flight and my companion's flight. I was told the only way I could extend points is by spending money with their company or a partner company. Forgive me if I have no desire to spend money with a company that tells me incorrect information then punishes me for believing it. I requested they pull the phone call and was told the records were too old and had been erased. After 2 hours on the phone, I had no choice and had to pay to transfer points, which I didn't need, from my father's account in order to extend my expiration date. I have now been punished for a Southwest Airlines employee's error. Doesn't seem quite right if you ask me, but Southwest refuses to do anything.",0
Outbound flight 19th Oct 2014 Manchester to Calgary TS215. Inbound Flight 26th Oct 2014 Calgary to Manchester TS214. First time Flying with Air Transat and we were very impressed with the whole experience from booking the flight to checking in online and the flight from Manchester to Calgary and back again. The staff couldn't do enough for you and I have flown with many airlines around the world and have to say that Air Transat was one of or even the best so far. We shall be booking again in the near future to fly back to Canada and Definitely going with Air Transat again.,1
"I will never fly American again! They missed my connecting flight on the way to Costa Rica and I spent seven hours in Miami airport. Now, I have been delayed and diverted on my return flight, so not only will I miss my connection again, I will have to find overnight accommodations and take an unpaid day off work tomorrow. Oh, and to make things better, all of the flights from Mimi to Newark tomorrow have layovers. Why should I expect them to be made?",0
Air India surprised me with the service for the price. Flight was clean and neat. They attached a tab for each seat with disposable headset to watch movies and free food that too with good taste.,1
"Worst customer service at Ranchi airport and this is the 3rd time, each time they create a unique bad experience with AirAsia at Ranchi. I saw them charging extra fee luggage, where couples were carrying with 14 kg cabined for checking. When I intervened they came with some random rules. But for sure will ensure I never use their service again",0
"Club Europe on British Airways. Outstanding and wonderful to have BA back. The welcome on board was warm and sincere. Flight attendants helpful, friendly and professional. Great updates from the flight deck. Super lunch and good choice of wines. BA at its best. Hopefully this excellence is also a reflection of a new CEO with the departure of Alex Cruz.",1
Despite having seats in the Emergency access the person sitting in the aisle seat had to awkwardly get out of his seat to let us out. The centre aisle was impossible to negotiate with other passengers and beverage carts. There was no entertainment and seat backs did not recline. There needs to be control of carry on baggage that people bring on board as we had trouble finding a little space for our small bag. The public announcement system was very difficult to understand. the person speaking spoke quickly and did not enunciate. The only benefit of the flight was that we got back to Vancouver!,0
Pathetic service. My flight was part of a connection and the last leg. It was cancelled without a reason and I was forced into accepting a later flight which increased my 36hr journey to almost 38hrs. They were rude when asked if they can put me on an earlier flight and didn't really care about the passengers.,0
"Missed my United Airlines flight from Washington to Raleigh Durham, Air France was late arriving in IAD. Although I had to stand in line for about 1 hr 45 min to get another ticket issued I have to compliment the agent who listened to everyone complaining. I smiled and she smiled back and my ticket was re issued without question for the next flight to RDU. United flight left and arrived on time. Inflight service was limited to hot coffee for me and it was most welcome. Crew were professional, polite and efficient. Seat was comfortable with ample leg room. No complaints, great flight will ride United Airlines again.",1
Downgraded without compensation. Flight from Hong Kong to Ho Chi Minh is going tomorrow. Short before flight they downgraded me from premium economy to economy due to overbooking. Two calls and no compensation offered. Only telling can happen they cannot do anything. Payed more to get less. I expected a bit more although I am a Oneworld silver member.,0
Melbourne to Sydney on 30 December 2013. Arrived at Tiger at 10am waste time of 5 hours as they cancelled our flight TT508 12.30pm from Melbourne to Sydney delayed later flight at 2.50pm and wasted our taxi booking at Sydney airport for 2.05pm. We arrived Sydney at 4pm. We had been told the plane was held back in Brisbane due to thunderstorms the night before so the plane couldn't reach to Melbourne,0
"Avoid American Eagle at all costs. I live near Roanoke and most of my flights have to go through American Eagle. I have lived in the area for 3 years and never had an on time flight with them. The last time I flew with them, they canceled my flight at boarding time ""because there weren't enough people"", and I swore them off. I had no choice today, however, and now I'm typing this from a hotel in Charlotte after my flight was delayed, then delayed again, then canceled.",0
On time. Lovely staff. Luggage arrived on time there and back. Really happy as I am a very anxious flyer. We had bike boxes and another hold bag and the service was speedy and stress free.,1
"This used to be my favorite airline for years. Last week I've got an email saying my flight back home to New York for 25th March is cancelled ""due to operational reasons. We will rebook you on alternative flights."" But no rebooking, they are unresponsive, sent 10 emails and tried to call many times.",0
"Detroit to Dallas. Horrible experience. I had to jump through many hoops in order to pay for my bag, and the agent helping me with it took so long that I almost missed my flight. When rushing to security I accidentally left my backpack at the counter and when I came back minutes later it was gone and the agent at the counter was extremely rude and unhelpful when I asked her if she had seen my backpack. At my gate I was practically yelled at by customer service for asking if they knew where my bag was. I also tried to call the airline to speak to someone in customer service to see if they had my backpack and was left ringing for 10 minutes before I finally hung up. Wish I could give them negative stars.",0
My trip is over and I have still not received my bag. Horrible service. They do not answer phone calls or respond to emails. They literally left me high and dry. The fact that my holiday is over and still no correspondence from this retched airline I feel is reason enough not to fly with them. Honestly ruined what was supposed to be a relaxing time.,0
Milwaukee to Los Angeles March 16 2014 returned March 19 2014. Flight 5165. Flight 1273 missed this flight due to the above one being late next flight UA729. Return flight 1498 delayed and missed connecting flight 5438 rebooked to flight UA5425. Late flights and rude service. My flight leaving was late and missed connecting flight. On the return home my flight leaving and connecting flights were late. Flight attendant stands in aisle talking while we try to get off plane to make connecting flights. Captain had asked everyone to be seated unless you have a connecting flight.,0
"Milan to Yerevan via Istanbul. AtlasGlobal lost my luggage 25 days later still haven't found it I am without my clothes and belongings. Contacted them numerous times and they do not have any idea where it is. At my way back wanted me to demonstrate visa to go back home, but I did not need visa?",0
"Lexington to Key West via Atlanta. I would discourage anyone needing to get to their destination on the same day as promised when purchasing tickets to avoid Delta. Delta claimed ""bad weather"" as a reason they could not land in Atlanta. However, our connecting flight took off during this extended period of 'bad weather.' They also lied about rebooking us on the next available flight. They also lied about having customer service representatives available at the gate upon arrival. They prevented a wedding party from attending the rehearsal for a destination wedding. If your travel plans matter to you, don't choose Delta.",0
Lanseria to Cape Town. Landed 30mins early. Good clean plane tight pitch but ok for a 2 hour flight. Excellent prices and Lanseria a great alternative to OR Tambo in Johannesburg. Highly recommended.,1
Guangzhou to Amsterdam. The flight was really nice and I really enjoyed it. The crew was very polite and helped. They calmed two little kids perfectly who was crying before take off and landing. The flight was very comfortable.  A very nice feeling and enjoyable.,1
"Miami to Nassau. It has to be the worst airline in the world. You check in, wait at the gate, but no plane in sight. Suddenly all passengers run to another gate and onto the landing strip, where we wait for another airplane. No information is provided at anytime. We believed that it was just bad luck and that the return flight would be better, but it turned out even worse. I'd rather swim to the Bahamas and back than traveling with Bahamasair.",0
Bangkok to Ubon Ratchathani . On time performance. Good service and light snack. Feel comfortable during flight. Cabin Crew are smiling while they do service to passengers.,1
"Stockholm to Lisbon. Departure late for 2 hours, no announcements, gates changed twice. Airplane food is atrocious, impossible to eat. Food service took long time, preparation for landing started 40min before landing, we were advised not to use toilets.  Currently waiting for luggage for 30min. I am a frequent traveler and didn't fly anything worse then this airline so far. Hoping for my luggage will arrive.",0
"I am frustrated by this airline. They have lost my bag in a direct 1 hour flight. It was scanned in the airport and since then, missing. I've not heard back from them unless I push them aggressively to call my from live chat, and even after that I hear the same status. I have tried everything, calling, filling forms, nothing has worked. Horrible customer service and horrible airline I've ever experienced. My bag had all my essentials and it was a relatively new bag itself. They are doing nothing to help me. I feel defeated.",0
"Got a free upgrade from premium economy to business class flying Air France from Singapore to Jakarta. The fully recline 180 degree seat is worth getting 5 stars, but meal selection and cabin service not quite at that level yet. Not too many beverages selection. This is only a short haul flight but they don't give you blanket by default.",1
"Frankfurt to Bucharest on Lufthansa, and overall rating very good. I had 40 minutes between flights and I was really surprised that my luggage arrived at my final destination. In these short flights, there is no inflight entertainment. Being only a short flight of less than 2hrs, we had a small breakfast and drinks. The aircraft was very clean as well and we arrived as usual in time with no delays. Lufthansa is still great.",1
"Flew Spirit Airlines from Latrobe to Orlando. After being delayed for 2 hours for an originally 5.20 flight, the flight was cancelled due to the plane not being able to leave Orlando due to a thunderstorm. Meanwhile, many other airlines were still able to fly. When we asked the people at the counter why they'd would not be sending a plane even though the thunderstorm had subsided, we were told there was only one crew and they could only work for so long. We were given the option to fly the same time the next day, which was not an option being we only had 3 days to spend. Many people were counting on getting to Orlando for their cruise or Disney tickets. They would only refund us for the flight. We ended up having to spend hundreds more to book a flight in another airport with another airline to get to our destination on time. I am a frequent flyer and have never experienced such inconsideration for customers before. I will never fly this airline ever again.",0
"Lisbon to Funchal. Their recent modifications to catering and cabin crew now friendly disposition made me decide to review them with a good catering. Food on board is of very good quality and healthy with flight attendants particularly pleasant. Less delays and less canceled flights are something to note too. The recent administration should maintain this course. It is however very unfortunate the excessive prices for some domestic flights of less than an hour and a half where there is a near commercial monopoly of TAP, particular to and from Madeira.",1
"Upon finding out the night before I was to depart that my flight was cancelled, I called to find out my options to reschedule. I was on hold to Customer Service for over eight hours with no response. I ended up going to the airport to talk to someone directly. I will never fly American again unless I have no other option. There is no acceptable excuse for the lack of communication. There were other negative ramifications due to the lack of response from American that I will not specify due to the length, but the ramifications are permanent and cannot be corrected.",0
I'll start by saying I fly Delta for a reason. We are in the plane and ready to take off and the bathrooms don't work. They tell us it will take 30 minutes to complete the paperwork but hold your bladder. So we started watching a movie. And they decided to push commercials on the screen as we sat in the plan. Next was the credit card push with a 10 minute announcement. I'm sorry but I'll take an extra stop on Delta than deal with this mickey mouse company,0
Sharjah to Beirut via Istanbul booked for later in March 2020. Worst airline website ever. Trying to contact Pegasus Airlines the whole day with more than one hour waiting time and no response. Waste of money and time Not recommended at all,0
"Cape Town to Brussels via Doha. I love Qatar airways.The cabin crew is friendly, accomodating, genuine, helpful and professional. The food is lovely and entertainment is great! The toiletry bags have something to assist with dry lips. Qatar airways is always my first choice airline.",1
Johannesburg to Walvis Bay. Very pleasant experience with good service and comfort on board. Seats in business class are very comfortable and allow a lot of legroom in the first two rows. Boarding process in Johannesburg was a bit chaotic due to the ground staff and no bus being available.,1
"San Francisco to Helsinki. I have flown Norwegian before and both experiences are similar. So you book your ticket which is cheaper then most other airlines offer but not by that much. Especially if you get all the additional they try and charge you for. If you want a similar experience to other competent airlines you will end up paying more with Norwegian. I mean they charge for everything under the sun, run the airplane cold so you will buy the blankets they sell you. The over priced meal is a joke. But what options do you have? Not to mention staff on every end from check in to the flight staff themselves treat you badly unless you pay for these extras. Overall staff are extremely rude on any interactions of any kind I have had with this airline. This is a horribly run airline and I would recommend any other airline over it. Trust me pay the little extra for a better airline avoid these people like the plague.",0
"Amsterdam to Delhi. Bad boarding management ever. Single very long and very slow queue formed, yet people constantly allowed out of queue. No announcement for seating zones. Bus to aircraft over packed, and awaited green signal for departure to aircraft for at least 10mins after being filled up, although it was neither first nor last bus leaving. Old aircraft. Poor infotainment system with poor audio. So many people asked for feedback form on boarding that the crew requested people on PA system to visit company website to give feedback. One of my worst boarding experiences ever.",0
"This was my first time to fly this direct flight from Toronto to Manila. Although the flight was full, it was comfortable after all. The flight crew were all smiles for the 16 hrs or so flight.",1
"Tampa to Charlotte. Absolute worst airline. Had to take emergency military leave to attend my grandfathers funeral. Was told by employee on the phone to buy a later in day ticket to save money and was assured multiple times that my ticket was available to be put on stand by for earlier flights. Arrived at TPA, only to be told by multiple employees that it wasnt eligible to be placed on stand by. So yes I know this is partly on myself for being ignorant enough to buy a later ticket. However, due to the dishonesty on the part of the sales representative and refusal to listen by the airport employees I missed my own grandfathers funeral. Really appreciate that AA. If I could give you a negative 10, I would.",0
"This airline has taken unbundled pricing to such an extreme that I'd rather pay more to fly on any other airline. The idea that I couldn't know whether my family of 5 would be seated together until 24 hours before the flight nor have the other family flying with us seated next to us without paying a premium turned me off to ever using Spirit unless I have no other choice. Also there were three seats together in last row and attendants wouldn't let my two kids move back one row so their friend could join them there claiming a weight and balance issue. Furthermore my boarding pass said I was eligible for ""Fast Bag Drop."" It took us about 30 minutes online to do our ""fast bag drop."" as the attendants at the fast bag drop counters seemed to be processing people who clearly had changes to make in their travel. Then after spending all that time in line we were forced to sign waiver tags clearing Spirit of any obligation if our bags didn't make it onto the plane on time because we were ""late"". If there really was a Fast Bag Drop we wouldn't have been late. Then the representative told us that the Spirit website said we were expected to be at the airport 2 hours before our flight. I've never heard any other airline demand this for domestic travel. Also we were subject to obnoxious credit card commercials from the plane attendants at the end of every flight. Both my outbound and return flights had a stop which meant we had to listen to the same sales pitch 4 times. I'm a customer not just a spigot for Spirit to try to pull additional dollars from.",0
I flew Manchester to Las Vegas in Oct originally I booked a front row seat in economy for a little extra leg room but passengers were offered for a fee an upgrade to premium economy I decide to take the offer and moved to premium which was more comfy as the seat is wider. The cabin crew were friendly and although it was a 10 hour flight it didn't seem to bad I didn't use the entertainment system as I had my tablet with me.,1
"Dublin to Dubai. Emirates is my favourite airline. Upon boarding the aircraft, I was greeted with smiles and welcomed. On the seat is a blanket and headphones. There is plenty of legroom, inflight entertainment system is wonderful. A large range of TV shows, movies and documentaries suited for all tastes. The inflight dining is the best I have experienced with any airline. The process of connecting in Dubai was seamless with staff on hand to assist passengers.",1
"I have flown with Philippine Airlines on many occasions and found their business class service to be acceptable, while there are many other airlines that offer better business class service, I choose to fly with Philippine Airlines because of the direct flight flight from San Francisco to Manila.  On May 10, 2020, my flight to the Philippines was canceled due to the Covid lockdown and I was offer a refund, it has been over 10 months since I requested a refund and I still have not received the fund. I have contacted Philippine Airlines by phone and emails many times and their customer service has been completely unhelpful. Every time I call Philippine Airlines, I am told to wait and that the refund has been processed. It appears to me that the airline does not want to refund their passengers and are using delay tactics. So travelers be aware that if you fly with Philippines Airline and a flight disruption occurs, you will be out the cost of your airline ticket. I have had other flights canceled on me with other airlines and refunds were received within two billing cycles. This is totally unacceptable for Philippine Airlines to not return customers funds for service that they did not provide. I would not recommend flying with Philippine Airlines.",0
"Paris to Orlando via Dallas Ft Worth. Front staff members that tooks us from one side to the other without clear instructions to rearrange our delayed flight. It took us an couple of hours to resolve our issue. Rude and unpleasant flight attendants that were not helpful. My worst experience flying has been with American Airlines and I refuse to fly with them again! They keep promoting their credit card and I even thought about getting it but after this horrible experience, AA is a not go option.",0
"Miami to Nashville. I have always had a terrible experience with American Airlines. My wife has been asked to give up her seat and be left behind while we were already sitting in 2015. I am currently writing this review while waiting on a flight that has been delayed 5 different times and have been sitting here for 4 hours on a 45 minute layover. They gave us some free crackers to apologize. I have had a pleasant experience a time or two, but unfortunately this seems to be par for the course for those of us that give this airline second chances.",0
"There were no manned counters available for economy class at all. Even 2.5 hours before the flight, no staff were available to assist us and staff in Perth airport were not familiar with the self check in kiosk issues. We took a good 2 hours to resolve our check in issues as there was a long line of people waiting in line as all of us had issues checking in via the online kiosks. There were only 2 staff walking around who arrived only 2 hours before flight. We were juggling the queue, our toddler, baggage and when we finally printed our boarding pass, we had to lug everything and our toddler who was cranky at this point from all the waiting and standing and queueing and then self check in our baggage one at a time. It was the worst service ever. Also the captain announced that there will be no wifi for that flight.",0
"I am so disappointed. After several phone calls and two emails, I have yet to hear back from Spirit Airlines about an overcharge that occurred as a result of them losing part of our reservation. All that I wanted was communication and a refund for the additional fees that resulted.",0
Absolutely horrible company to fly for. Customer service at it's worse. Which to say is usually a chat bot no way to speak to a live person over the phone. You can only message them through chat. My flight was canceled twice in less then a month and they don't have another flight the same day so your choice is to fly a few days later which both times the next flight was booked from other cancellations or rent a car and you have to pay for it. If you cancel your flight 26 hours later outside of their 24 hour window you loose the ticket completely no refund and you can't get that ticket back even if that flight ends up getting canceled by them. DO NOT I REPEAT DO NOT PURCHASE the all you can fly pass. It's basically stand by even though an agent told me I could book in advance. You will be out the price of the pass and have to purchase your ticket anyways. Prices might appear to be cheap at first but not with all the add ons and expenses incurred from canceled flights and trying to get to your destination. Do not plan your vacation or trip if you're hoping to get there on time or at all.,0
"Great service and food.  Flight attendants helpful. Got my special meal with gluten free buns. Had dinner in a 2 hour flight, and 2 meals on a long 13 hour flight.",1
My wife and I flew Virgin Australia VA 149 Boeing 737 800 Auckland to Melbourne on Anzac day April 25th. Plane clean flight left on time arrived on time. Cabin crew good in Melbourne the attendant got our bags out of overhead lockers then stood in aisle holding back other passengers so we could exit our seats. Plenty of room in seats only two used out of three Second time we have flown Virgin both flights were good will use them again.,1
"Melbourne to Denpasar. Delays, cancellations, then more delays. Terrible service in the air and on the ground. Disorganized teams that were so accustomed to unhappy travelers, that they barely paid attention to our concerns. As a very experienced traveler, this was the worst experience I have endured. The first and last time I will fly Jetstar",0
Use Ryanair on the Leeds Bradford flight often find them a great service very clean and good value for money. Great timing for onward connections.,1
"Tehran to Paris CDG with Iran Air. Their new and well maintained aircraft are being being used on this route so I had a pleasant experience with them. Food was amazing, cabin crew were very professional, and the flight was extremely smooth.",1
Flight was cancelled out of Ft Lauderdale due to bad weather at our destination. Instead of rescheduling they offered a flight 2 days later with 4 layovers. Was originally a direct flight. New flight offered was 11 hours. Traveling with 2 small children this is not an option. Had to get a refund and spend an extra 500 dollars to fly a different airline. Will never fly Spirit again.,0
"Seattle to Rome via Frankfurt, and Lufthansa is an excellent airline. Friendly staff, flight attendants professional and engaging. We paid extra for extra legroom seats, and worth every cent. Regular economy seemed a bit cramped. Inflight entertainment worked perfectly and had plenty of options. Cabin clean, and newly refurbished. Food plentiful, and good, and two hot meals on the long haul sectors. ",1
"I commend the crew that was serving the business class guests on the China Southern flight from Sydney to Guangzhou. They were very friendly and helpful and willing to help. My wife and I was transiting to celebrate our honeymoon in Europe, but wanted to exit the airport briefly to meet a friend for some clothes. The air hostess was willing to help us ask ground crew if she could exit customs area then return with our clothes. She was most helpful and really made the start of our honeymoon extremely enjoyable. Thank you.",1
"Guangzhou to Adelaide on 23rd February 2019. This was the best flight I had taken. Meals was more than sufficient, individual screen with variety of entertainments. Cabim staff were very polite to passengers and provided the best service.",1
"It was our first time to fly on Japan Airlines and we were impressed with the staff. A very special ""Thank You"" to maintenance staff at the Manila airport. Long story short, my glasses went under my seat in Business Class and they found them. During the flight the flight attendants did all they could to help me find my glasses and when we did not find them, they called Manila prior to our arrival and had a maintenance staff member meet us at the gate. Unfortunately, after about 15 minutes of removing panels and searching, the glasses were not found. Maintenance staff promised he would continue to take things apart and do all that he could to find my glasses. He found them and I was able to pick them up at the JAL office in Manila prior to my flight departure the next day. ",1
Flew from Paris to Lisbon and back. I am six foot two and so the biggest gripe was space which there is very little of. Manageable on short two hour flights but anything more will be quite tough. Flight attendants were very helpful however and let me switch to an unoccupied row so I could stretch my legs a bit and on the return an emergency exit row so I had more space. Planes were new and clean flight attendants very friendly and helpful as well. Planes took off on time and landed either early or on time. Effortless journey and found them perfect for short flights would easily recommend them the next time.,1
I flew Air Canada a couple of times recently to Vancouver. It was a very enjoyable experience. The staff are very efficient at their work. In serving the meals they are very quick to serve as they have 4 people serving two for the meals and two later for the drinks. After the meal is done we didn't have to wait for long before they came to pick up the trays. I would take Air Canada for long haul flights. Air Canada's service is excellent!,1
"Newcastle to San Francisco via Paris. Really impressed. The A380 is a great aircraft and we really enjoyed our flight. The cabin was not ultra modern and maybe in need of a refresh soon but it was clean and comfortable. We loved our seats in row 93 and no one behind us so we could recline. Service was punctual we were offered an aperitif with a snack and you could have champagne, the meal service was good with plenty of food. There was snacks and soft drinks in the galley where you could help yourself. Another meal was served before landing. Entertainment was a little outdated but it served a purpose. Loved the big storage boxes on the side of our seat as we were on the upper deck. Very comfortable flight. The crew were helpful and friendly.",1
I had an 8 hour of flight from Brussel to Montreal. We were served with lunch and a snack. No refreshments were served in between. I asked for baby food and flight attendant said I had to request it in advance.  Extremely disappointed with this airline. They are charging so much for the tickets but the service in return is absolutely zero. Flight attendants were rude to me. I will try to avoid them for my next travel.,0
"Phoenix to Calgary. Worst airline ever. Every few years I decide to try them again. How could they mess up this time?. Well silly me. I booked a return flight. Then my client who I was traveling to see moved the meeting so I needed to change the inbound flight. Airline said no changes allowed. I was happy buying a new inbound ticket but they said if I didn't show up for inbound flight, the entire ticket would be cancelled.",0
"Havana to Buenos Aires. I had no trouble with the schedule departure time. Aircraft is a Russian aircraft. Uncomfortable. No entertainment.  Food was the worst I've ever seen or tasted for a premium cabin. Toilet was old, dirty. The flight attendants were ok but it doesn't make you feel you are in a premium cabin. They took the food that was left, with them. These people are hungry in their country. I would never fly with them again. Not for pleasure, not for work.",0
Lanzarote one way flight from Bristol 8th January. A handful of minutes late departing and arrived Arrecife half an hour early. Totally uneventful flight. What more do you want?,1
"Worst airline ever. Before our flight they said there is technical issues in the airline I have record of that site was showing too. Then an other issue then weather problem finally they called cancelled flight. I got rebooked again through Expedia, now I am at New York, no one knows where is my checked in luggage.",0
"Flight cancelled, never got a refund after countless mails. Absolute scam, dont fly this airline. I have flown with them before, and it was alright but if there is any problem, you lose all your money.",0
"Sydney to Brisbane. The worst airline experience I've had in my life. Inexplicable delays, constant rude and unhelpful service. I will not fly with them again after being stuck in an airport for 5 hours because they decided to cancel my flight on a day when every other airline is flying.",0
"Flight delay for 6 hours, they made us wait for 1 hour and put us on plane under the rain! Cabin crew are very rude and disrespectful. My daughter didn't have a pushchair when we landed in Amsterdam! Lost! How could such a thing happen? My daughter does not have a pushchair at the moment on holiday. I never recommend this airline!",0
Flight from Florence to Brussels total chaos.  Half the passengers were not allowed to board as according to the captain they did not have enough fuel and needed to reduce weight.  All luggage was offloaded and so none arrived in Brussels. Still waiting as there is only one flight a day.  When SABENA was alive most things went wrong but no one understood why.  With SN they tell you why but it still goes wrong.,0
Flying American is always the most painful way to travel. Customer Service is not on the list of priorities. For every one employee trying to do a good job there are three more will be unhelpful and downright rude!,0
Delhi to Bali via Ho Chi Minh City. One of the worst airlines I have seen. They ruined my trip by cancelling the flights from Delhi to Bali and was standing 6 hours inside airport just to know they are not operating because they do not have enough passengers. Is that a joke or what. Spent in lakhs for my trip and now my agent is denying to provide refund or any compensation for no show because of this.,0
We booked a very last minute flight and hotel through Jet 2 at Glasgow Airport after another travel company let us down after booking a package holiday through them and subsequently lost our holiday with them after they changed the flight details and did not notify us causing us to miss our flight and holiday. The staff at the Jet 2 desk in Glasgow Airport couldn't have been more helpful and salvaged our holiday as we were left with no alternative options through our original travel provider and extremely disappointed. Can't rate the level of helpfulness of the Jet 2 staff enough and will defiantly be booking through Jet 2 again.,1
"Geneva to London. I have flown Swiss and never had much to say, but I feel compelled to write a positive review after an experience of getting snowed in at the Geneva Airport. My original flight was cancelled a day prior which gave me time to figure alternatives. Swiss switched my flight 4 Times for me. With no extra payment, easy, no hassle and I did not pay for an insurance like other cheap airlines I have flown with. Their staff was quick on the phone, happy to work with me, and I know I will be booking them in the future. Unfortunately I needed to get to London for a conference so the next day option did not work and I had to entirely switch airlines. But for other customers, Swiss was reliable for their flexibility and consideration in flight cancellations.",1
"Indianapolis to Chicago. At a level, it feels a shame to critique airlines in the current crisis however, when one's memory is of terrible service, uncaring employees, and being metaphorically charged for just about everything except breathing, one can't have much sympathy for the American carriers. To describe this particular regional service as basic would be an exaggeration. American Airlines attitude seems to be to ""get the cattle on the truck"", and then act as if they were doing passengers a great service by providing a plastic up of ice water. Thank goodness this flight was short, and on time. Seats were incredibly uncomfortable, wifi did not work as usual. Difficult to avoid this airline, due to their relative monopoly in the USA. I wouldn't want taxpayers money to bail them out.",0
"I've flown a lot but my flight from London to New York with Virgin Atlantic was amongst my best ever. I was in economy but my seat was fine not too hard like some can be and at 6""6 I didn't struggle for leg room so that was a bonus. The plane was newish and cool, well air conditioned without being freezing, and the food was great nice touch offering an ice cream late in the flight. But what really set this flight apart was the attentive and personable service the British based crew provided, not just to me but to everyone within my ear shot. These people seem to genuinely like us and appeared to really be into our reasons for travelling to NY great to be asked but better still to be interested. They couldn't do enough for us and I was blown away. Well done, too often I get disinterested, tired or bored service and Virgin was a very welcome and refreshing exception.",1
"Auckland to Hong Kong. Worst experience with an airline.Very unhelpful and rude people at check in. The women at the check in desk asked us to show her on our ticket what the flight number was, She couldn't read her own airline ticket. On top of that she also missed that the luggage were traveling all the way to Istanbul and messed that up. We'll never fly with Hong Kong Airlines again.",0
I had a horrible experience flying with United. My Flight was delayed 19 hours total. I had to drive back home to sleep the night as my flight was rescheduled the next morning. I also missed two connecting flights that I had to reschedule due to United. I stayed at the airport for nine hours as they pushed back the departure time every half hour. I truly regret flying with United. I make sure to never make this mistake ever again.,0
"Check in at San Andres had to be done at the airport since I had a bag to drop off, the line was very long so I waited about 40 minutes. Since there are no drinks or snacks available for sale on the plane I bought some stuff at the airport to bring along on the plane. Flight back to Bogota was quite smooth, quiet and easy. I flew back on the same plane that had brought me to San Andres. Nothing to complain about. Cheap option to San Andres and very efficient.",1
"London Heathrow to Sydney return via Kuala Lumpur. Whilst the process of flying with Malaysia Airlines was satisfactory, one of my bags was delayed by 4 days on the flight out. In the first case I had no indication from the airline as to whether it was lost forever, or would arrive in a day, week, or month. This was just the beginning of the poor correspondence, and eight weeks later I am still yet to have a single email or telephone call answered by them. I've tried telephone, email, facebook, and even twitter, and still not a single person has got back to me. Probably the worst service I've ever received.",0
"Guangzhou to Tokyo in September. To my surprise, almost all restaurants inside the international terminal are closed because of the epidemic. I am very grateful that the China Southern Airlines ground staff checked my visa and took me to the China Southern Airlines lounge so that I could enjoy a wonderful breakfast.",1
"Baku to Frankfurt via Doha was very comfortable, lovely crew and the world's newest aircraft A350. That was my first time to flying with Qatar Airways, I'm student from Azerbaijan. And that was my dream to fly with A350. The ticket was so cheap, that I could buy this ticket. Thanks to Qatar Airways for unforgettable journey.",1
"Lynx Air took off on time, arrived on time, and did not lose my luggage. What more could any traveller ask.",1
"London to Montreal. Very bad service with delayed luggage. For some reason the person at london heathrow send my suitcase under someone else's name and to a different destination. I was flying from London to Montreal and my suitcase was sent to Dublin. First guy I talked on the phone, after a week of no news at all, he told me that the suitcase was found but was left there at the airport and no further action was taken. Were they waiting for me to ask them to send it or something? In theory, he sent an email asking the airport to send my suitcase to Montreal. But after another week of no further news and website still saying suitcase is missing, I decided to call them again to find out that my suitcase, was still in Dublin. A second email, was sent to get my suitcase send it to me. A couple of days after and of course, with no news at all from them, I decided to call them back again. This time my suitcase wasn't in Dublin, it was sent to London Heathrow and they lost it again at that airport. This guy, asked me to call them back, Monday morning London time, so I did. I called back again on Monday morning, and after being about 10 minutes waiting for the guy to connect to his London team, he asked me to go to the website to add description of the items in my suitcase, when I had done that same day I placed the delayed luggage report. Don't they have all this info in file?. After telling him that I did that, first day, he then asked me to call them back in 48h again. I'm tired of going behind them like if it was my fault they lost my suitcase. No compensation was mentioned to me, even that I had to buy clothes and some other items that I already had in my suitcase. Lucky enough, this happened in my final destination and at the end of my trip, otherwise they would make my vacation quiet miserable. I understand, there is a huge number of suitcases traveling around everyday but that's no reason to let you wondering and waiting forever to get what's yours. I think this whole experience would have been much more satisfying if they showed some empathy and instead of making me wait and call them all the time, I would have get a call or email from them every once in a while following up with me. After this awful experience with their missing luggage department, I hardly doubt I will use British Airways again.",0
"Flew Frontier Airlines from Portland, Maine to Orlando, Florida. Awful, Awful, Awful. Cancelled our flight. Would not help get us another flight within 4 days. Would not get us a hotel. They did nothing for us. Ruined out family vacation. Never again. I would give negative 10 if I could.",0
"Denver to Missoula. Never flying with them again. My flight has been delayed 4 times with a possible cancellation due to weather where the plane that I'm supposed to be on is coming from. They've told me if I do get a cancelation because of weather it's not their fault so they refuse to offer accommodations because as they said, ""I can just sleep at the airport."" Not only could i possibly have to pay for a hotel room and travel to and from the airport, but I'll be missing work. They dont care about their customers at all.",0
"Bangkok to Phnom Penh. The plane was old. No personal TV, so zero entertainment. The service was minimal. Cabin crew rushed through everything. One cabin crew didn't even wait for me to take a sugar for my tea.",0
"We had our tickets canceled due to COVID a year ago and we still can't get our refund back. They withdrew the money and do not want to return it. During the year they said we had to wait a little longer and they would return everything and 12 months had passed. Terrible customer service, always say the same thing and then just hang up. It is better to spend more money than to order tickets from them again",0
"Seoul to Istanbul via Almaty. I was uneasy throughout the flight. Passengers have been on board for over an hour and have not left. In the meantime, the announcement came 40 minutes later. The children's food came out as baby food. I asked stewardess the adult meals because child could not eat, but she declined firmly.",0
"Singapore to Bangkok on Thai Airways Boeing 787. The TV was so big and was touchscreen, much faster than the last time I set on it. The leg space was big, but they need to improve on the food. The cabin service was marvellous. The window had auto shade and didn't need someone to pull the shade. ",1
First time with Air France flying from Paris CDG to Dubai. What a surprise. Everything went just perfectly. Boarding has been very fast. Seat was so comfortable that I managed to sleep although I can never sleep in Economy. Awesome variety of entertainment channels and movies. Food was excellent as the drinks. Flight attendants extremely courteous and professional. Clean toilets. Only one tiny negative remark. There was no WiFi on board this flight and I needed it for work.,1
"Best domestic airline I have flown with in India. New and clean aircrafts. Amazing crew members. My flight was only 1 hour 15 minutes, and the airline served full meal course and drinks, which is very unlikely these days. All my flights were on time. Super impressed with the service. Highly recommended. They provide wifi to watch movies while onboard, amazing.",1
Not dependable airline at all booked my flight back home a month in advance and when I get to the airport the flight has been canceled with out any warning they state they sent out a. Email and I never received it. I was left stranded in a foreign country with. No help they refuse to offer any other options at the kiosk at the airport other than give me credit for their next available flight which was over a month later so I called the 1800 number and they were just as useless I had to pay 400usd with a different airline for the following day leaving me in the streets over night all because the airline could do nothing or offer any other options the supervisors were just as rude as the workers if not worst. How stressful it was to sleep in the airport floor over night and they could not give a care in the world,0
"Vancouver to Paris and back. Flight over was great plane with new interior. Food was decent and the staff very friendly. On are way back we had an older plane the individual LCD screen that was not very responsive but once the film started it worked well. My only complaint is that when there was an announcement on the intercom when you were using the entertainment ""with ear buds"" was way too loud.",1
"Orlando to Washington, D.C. Great flight with United, easy check in at MCO and nice staff all around. Plane was an older one, but the seat was comfortable and servcie was good.",1
Gold Coast to Melbourne. Zero customer service. Staff so rude. First they sell cheap tickets online later they charge money when u check in. Their staff will not help you they will not listen you. We get their on time to board our flight. We was unable to self check in system was not working . We ask for help their staff told us to process to counter where we had a few people ahead they made us wait more then 40 min. And then said sorry you came late and miss the flight.,0
"EasyJet lost my baggage and couldn't care less. After 48 hours they only sent one email saying ""sorry for any inconvenience"", but no updates to where my luggage is or when I will get it back. Should I go to the shop and buy a new wardrobe? There is no way of contacting them, no numbers are manned.",0
"Terrible customer service, absolutely no help. Contacted the airline because I could not make my first flight due to work but was getting another flight the next day. Still needed my flight to go home, no problem. They cancelled my return flight without my knowledge and have to nerve to tell me it would be another 290 charge for the flight I already paid for. They said its because I missed my first flight, but no where in there policy it states cancellation of your paid flight. They had no help to offer what so ever.",0
"The worst first class flight I have ever traveled and a waste of hard earned money. No food was offered beside a box of cheap snacks, no drinks but water, no service for both parts of flight. Small seats, no room for personal bag to stay with me. I feel so ripped off! I travel first or business class for all flights over three hours. I will not use Delta again. On trip back I paid extra for a shorter flight with minimal stops. Paid extra to have my boys sit together and Delta chanted all flights removing pre paid seats and separated our boys. The new flight added many hours to our journey. Not a pleasant experience. I had a choice between Delta and American for the trip and even though Delta was more booked it for more direct flight. So disappointed.",0
"The flight was smooth but delay in Malang about 55 minutes and to Pontianak about 2.5 hours. Ground staff was quickly pick me up to the gate because I almost miss my connection to Pontianak. The cabin staff was nice, smiling, polite and attentive to serve the passenger. MLG to CGK and CGK to PNK only me seated on business class in this flight. Food was nice and tasty. I will fly Garuda Indonesia again next time",1
"Worst service I've ever gotten with an airline. Tried to contact for about week before a flight through all of their recommended means, but they never contacted me back. Four different people tried on three separate occasions to contact via phone. When we finally got a hold of a representative, they were rude and wanted to charge basically the cost of the flight for changes. A dismal customer service representative.",0
"Guangzhou to Calgary via Vancouver. My first experience on China Southern Airlines Boeing 787. The cabin crew were very friendly, addressed me by my name and dealt with a few difficult passengers professionally. IFE has an excellent selection. The seats are comfortable with handy power sockets on every seat. Food was amazing and beef rendang cooked to perfection. ",1
"Everything was very clean, the staff were friendly and the plane was wonderful. The food was tasty. Emirates is always my first option.",1
"Prague to Singapore via Heathrow with British Airways. Not a good experience flying BA. Will never book again. Website allowed me to book a connecting flight with only 1 hour 40 minutes to spare. This is not sufficient time if you have to change terminals and especially if you have kids. We did not miss our flight but we had to run fast to make it with 2.5 year old toddler. There are no airport strollers available so be prepared to carry your child. Crew below average, food was terrible and not enough of it. At both destinations they didn't deliver our stroller.",0
"Alaska cancelled our connecting flight without notice. Added hours to our layover with a 10 month old. Staff were at best completely useless, at worst insulting with their placations. Alaska must have a lot of people with an unofficial title of ""Professional Useless Person"" given the enormous number of Alaska staff walking around. Everything seemed to be everyone else's department. It's amazing how many employees you need to tell someone to call customer service. This used to be a great airline. Now it is my last choice.",0
Rome to New York. Terrible customer service! We arrived at the airport over 2 hours before our flight was supposed to take off. It took over an hour of to get checked in since they will not let you use a kiosk. After the guy printed our tickets and took our luggage he said it was now unlikely we would make our flight because we stood in line for so long and then we had a long walk ahead of us to the gate. They also would not change our seats for my husband and I to sit together on our on honeymoon. Somehow we made the flight to find our multiple other couples around us had been separated from their family as well. Service on the flight was not amazing either. I would pay more to avoid flying with this airline in the future.,0
"Aguascalientes to Mexico City. I got a free upgrade to Clase Premier along with my travel companion. It was a nice short flight, the flight attendants were attentive and called us by our names. On time departure and arrival, Sky Priority and a snack with beer.",1
From Vientiane to Bangkok. Aircraft was a new Airbus A320. The fare was good the check in smooth the service was excellent and a tasty fresh snack was served. The flight departed on time. Overall an excellent experience with a small but good quality airline.,1
"Dubai to London. I have been flying Emirates for 34 years since they started. Recently did a return trip to London for 3 days in business. They sent an S class Mercedes to pick me at home in Dubai, I hung out in the C terminal lounge where I smoked a cigar, both flights there and back in A380s and on the Gatwick return it was 2 months old and very pleasant. Crew were attentive, friendly, food and drinks excellent, ICE was outstanding. In fact along with another S class Mercedes in London this is the only way to fly to London. I consistently rank them as one of the world's best airlines.",1
I will never fly Spirit again. I was foolish enough to give them a second chance after my first bad experience and this time they completely cancelled my flight from Atlanta to Detroit and couldn't get me home for a few days. I rented a car and drove and got a refund. The discount just isn't worth the lost time frustration and aggravation. In the future I will fly a real airline.,0
"Mumbai to Hong Kong via Delhi. I arrived 10 mins after the boarding started, and was told to queue in line to board despite being a business class passenger. Thankfully another member of staff acknowledged my business class status and allowed me to board first. Due to technical reasons the flight was delayed by 45 minutes after boarding was completed. Staff were really nice looked after the people in business class and offered drinks and food. After take off, food was served and the food was really tasty. Only thing that bothered me was that Air India doesn't serve alcohol in the domestic sector. Layover in Delhi was good and efficient, and soon we were ready for take off. Crew took our meal choices and preferred drinks after take of. This sector they had alcohol. Decided to skip the late night dinner and just had a glass of champagne and got a nice sleep of 4 hours. Overall a good airline and would recommend.",1
Never have had a good experience with Frontier. They are so cheap with every charge. Next thing they will do is add a charge to fasten your seatbelt. When you call them they direct you to their instant message chat in which the responsiveness is less than desirable. Very frustrating you can't talk to an actual human over the phone. I think they intentionally do it to screw their customers. Originally was booked to fly out of Philadelphia then ended up having to drive all the way to Cleveland to get a flight.,0
"Johannesburg to Accra via Nairobi. My luggage went missing in Nairobi. Took three days to have my bags arrive in Johannesburg. When I got my luggage zips were broken, locks removed and my some of my stuff were not inside.",0
"Malaysia Airlines are providing vouchers instead of refunding flights impacted by corona virus. Unfortunately MAS are stipulating you have to rebook by December and have completed flights by June 2021. This is less than 1 year now and getting less every day. Most airlines are offering 1 year from original flight dates, some are 2 years.",0
Vueling Airlines flight was overbooked and the leg space was terrible. They lost my luggage and there is no number to call. Had to wait on hold for 45 minutes just to talk to main office. They had no idea luggage status or where it could be. Many other passengers did not get there luggage either. Vueling Airlines lost the luggage or it never got put on the flight from Rome. Unfriendly flight crew as well.,0
14th Nov Gold Cast to Kuala Lumpur D7 207. 16th Nov Kuala Lumpur to Gold Coast D7 202. I enjoyed my flight from Kuala Lumpur to Gold Coast. The flight was very smooth and the cabin crew provided excellent service. I will definitely be flying AirAsiaX again.,1
"New York to Istanbul. Worst experience yet flying ever. The flight was delayed 3 hours and when asked about connecting flight the staff could give no information, said just to wait and maybe we would still make the connecting flight. When we missed the flight then someone would help us. When I called the online service the staff was extremely unhelpful and refused to find a manager for me, when I called back she said she was referring me to customer service but really just left me on hold for 10 minutes until I hung up. Horrendous, tickets may be cheap but reflects the service and reliability",0
My flight was supposed to leave at 12pm. I get multiple notifications that it has been delayed. It is now delayed until 1am. I try every number I could find to talk to a human and get this figured out. Every number just sent me a link to click. I click the link and it's just an automated message. I am unbelievably annoyed at this point. My flight is one hour from a sunny place to another sunny place. I can't begin to understand why it would be delayed so drastically. I honestly would rather get my money back and drive 6 hours then deal with this airline.,0
Moscow to Tivat at the end of summer. Flight was well served and food were fine. Staff was helpful. I use the loyalty program of the airline and this makes my flight even more pleasant and cheap. Don't miss a chance to fly with Aeroflot.,1
The seats are definitely not geared for Western heights and weights. My husband was tortured with no legroom for 13 hours. It was just not comfortable. Might be ok under 5 hour flights but for long distance travel its brutal. The staff were accommodating. Food was pretty bad and I actually didn't know what some of the items that were served. I left a lot. Not sure I'd fly this airline again because of the cramped uncomfortable seating. That's really all they have to offer.,0
"Mask wearing is supposedly required but certainly not enforced. Many passengers had masks down over their mouths but not noses and after some heavy turbulence, about half the passengers I saw just took their masks off or wore them under their chins. The plane was filthy and old.",0
"Horrible customer service, no representative in the France airports, 3 hours on the phone, no one answer the questions, and after missing a flight no one respond.",0
"Every time we fly there's always a delay for mechanical issues, stuck on the runway and taxied back into sit for 3 hours on a hot plane. Worst Airline possible. Yes, flights are cheap, but you get what you pay for, horrible.",0
I booked a flight only to have it cancelled days later. When I called a few weeks after to follow up on the refund they told me it would be several months as they are currently still catching up on refunds from March! Almost as if they are only selling flights for the quick cash just to cancel them? Absolutely disgusting. They have lost my trust and my business. I will never fly with them again and will encourage everyone I know to go with more respectable airlines. Do yourself a favour and save your money!,0
Last year I flew from Sydney to Hong Kong the flight was delayed 2 hours which wasn't too bad. Onboard the flight the food was good for an economy class ticket the seats where comfortable and the entertainment was excellent. The flight attendants were very nice pleasant and helpful. Overall the flight was good and pleasant and I would recommend that anyone who's deciding on an airline to fly on should consider flying Cathay Pacific Airways.,1
Newark to Mexico City. The unfriendly skies. Flew with my 3 and 5 year old boys. They were not able to seat us together despite I asked when checking in and on the plane. The plane was not full. This is the first time an airline place my kids away from me. One kids fell sleep and the other came up to me on my middle seat. The guy next to me tried to help and moved one row forward to the emergency row so my boy could be next to me. Immediately a sour purser came and threw him back as the emergency row is a premium seat on United. I understand their policy but do think the purser could have helped. Lounge food is very low quality compared to Lufthansa or BA. We are gold and silver level on SA which seems to be only reason to fly United so you can board early and bring more luggage,0
Arriving to Washington DC Dulles Airport for my flight to Croatia via Frankfurt Airport I was offered special care due to a lower back injury that severely hampered my physical movement. From the US through Frankfurt Airport and upon arrival in Zagreb Croatia I was offered friendly transit support at each and every stage. I have made this flight over 100 times and despite the pain associated with my injury I must say that this was the most satisfying travel experience I have had in over 30 years of international travel.,1
"Again Tigerair is delayed flying from Sydney to Melbourne. We had already been informed since booking that the flight had been rescheduled to 3 hours later, this was inconvenient but ok. However, to now be stuck at the airport with a further 2 hour delay on the revised flight time is ridiculous. Delays have become the norm with this airline, what a disaster.",0
"Boarding shambolic. No separate line for Business Class. Drive 20 minutes in packed stuffy bus and waited another 20 minutes in hot, stuffy bus. Then another 10 minutes to another aircraft and noticed that the crew and cleaners were just boarding. Another 20 minutes waiting liked packed sardines. No announcement, no apology, nothing.",0
"Guam to Manila with Philippine Airlines. The flight was fully booked and I checked in a little late, so I get to sit at the far back. As well, I boarded the plane last. Since all the overhead compartments are fully occupied, the flight crew told me that my carry on luggage will be placed along with the checked in baggage. I told the flight crew that I am transiting in Manila on another terminal and that if I check in my baggage, I will most likely miss my next flight. They understood my situation and made provisions for my carry on.",1
Five of us flew from Palm Springs CA to Philadelphia PA. Our flight was cancelled due to weather in our connecting city so we had to stay over an extra day but United was helpful and upgraded us to premium economy. We had a great flight friendly flight attendants and got a great deal on ticket prices. I would recommend United Airlines.,1
I booked 2 tickets on Vietjet going from Saigon to Tokyo. I had a connecting flight in Tokyo a few hours later going to Los Angeles. We had all the proper documentation to board the flight. Upon check in we were told we needed a visa to go to the Narita airport which is absolutely not the case. We flew through Narita on the way to Vietnam and had zero issues transferring flights. It also states right on the Narita airport website and the Japanese Embassy website that travel through the Narita airport is fine. Vietjet customer service is terrible. They would not look at these websites as we told them to do which had the correct information nor would they call the Narita airport in Tokyo to get the correct information. They just denied us entry. On top of this when I asked for a refund the 'manager' told me there would be no refund. I then had one other flight option that would make our connection in Tokyo so I had to book literally last minute those tickets at an enormous cost. Of course once again we had no problems transferring in Tokyo and made our connection. To date Vietjet had not responded to any of my requests for a refund or compensation for the costs I incurred because of their incompetence. I recommend never flying this airline.,0
"Frankfurt to Austin. Do not use this airline! 6 hours of delays on my first flight. They messed up my meal and the flight attendants were very unfriendly and made me feel like I was unwelcome. Once I arrived in Frankfurt I find out that due to their delays I had missed my connecting flight. I was told I had to go over to their ticket counter and get rebooked and the when I arrived the lady said they had already rebooked me as if I had any way of knowing. Return flight was also delayed 2hrs. No meal again, had to buy a snack. Was starving after 13hr flight. I arrive in Texas and find out my luggage was lost. It has been a week and Condor is refusing to help me. I have followed all their instructions with no results. If you call them they are rude, if you email them you get a auto reply. This airline is not the fastest route due to their  delays. It is not worth the money and it could end up costing you money of they lose your bag.",0
"Ft Myers to Key West with Silver Airways. Sitting and waiting due to mechanical problems. Same thing happened a year ago and ended up driving to Key West. I will never take this flight again. They provide no information on what is happening, when or if we will ever leave. Avoid at all costs.",0
"Chicago to Vienna. The worst experience I  had. I was traveling with 11 month old baby, just 2 of us. It was really hard but the stuff weren't that helpful.  My baby really active and I put tray with food on floor, so he doesn't mess with it and When time came to clean I asked the steward to clean it and he roll his eyes on me and said "" Are you serious put it on floor what I suppose to clean your mess after you now"".",0
"I use to fly between Germany and Spain about 20 roundtrips a year, usually on Ryanair. I consider Ryanair's product to be well suited for my needs. Just a seat, no frills, low price, easy way to get from A to B. Nevertheless within the last weeks Ryanair has started to arbitrarily cancel flights due to a low load factor. Somehow I understand this, when there is a sudden change in government rules and people just stop buying tickets. But now Ryanair just cancels whatever flight, that was offered a few weeks ago, just because their load factor is too low for their needs. This happened about two weeks ago and I had to rearrange my travelling, throwing away a couple of tickets from the 8 flights I had already booked with Ryanair. Now they do the same thing once again and my travel plans are totally screwed. From the few flights Ryanair offers, they just cancel whatever flight they want to, obviously without compensation. Therefore I strongly advice to NOT book any Ryanair flight, unless there is normal travelling available maybe in spring 2022. Until then, stick to the serious companies that do fly, when they offer flights.",0
I would like to take the time to sincerely thank the staff of China Southern Airlines. When I arrived at the airport too early on flight CZ391 and the staff of the quarantine department didn't go to work. I was very confused and didn't know what to do.  She contacted the staff of the quarantine department and volunteered to help me fill in the customs declaration form correctly. Her professional service saved me from long waiting times.,1
"London to Tokyo Narita. Had a fantastic flight in the new BA First cabin on the Boeing 787. On both journeys the crew were outstanding as was the food and the service. The food was of high end restaurant standard, the seat comfortable.",1
"Well, my friend and I were flying from Calgary to Toronto. Our flight was scheduled to depart at around 7 and we reached the airport very early at around 5. To our astonishment the Lynx check in services told us that our flight got cancelled with zero explanation why, no cancellation email as well. Lynx did not even take the effort to rebook us on to another flight and their customer service was not available. My friend and I had to scramble to find another flight ourselves to Kitchener airport spending an extra 628 dollars in all and not to mention the extra Uber cost that we may incur later. Totally frustrated with this airline, they have zero sense of accountability or professionalism and I will never take this airline again. I wish there was a way to give a negative score to this airline. Absolutely horrendous.",0
"Paris to Cagliari via Rome. A new aircraft I believe with nice seats and very clean. Staff nice and smiling. Service has changed with a small sandwich and choice of drinks. Arrival at Rome and bus to the terminal, however faster than before. Gate for connecting flight to CAG reached in 5 minutes. Flight from Rome to Cagliari was pleasant, no snack only drinks.",1
July 31st stuck at airport. Flight has been delayed. From all the reviews I have read this is apparently a reoccurring issue with this airline. Allegiant need to get their act together. They charge for everything so don't think you are saving money because you are not. You can fly better airlines and save yourself the stress.,0
"Qsuites on the A350 on Qatar are incredible. The privacy, inflight entertainment, and the most importantly the service afforded by the flight attendants are second to none.",1
"Flew Brussels Airlines, flight 551 from Brussels to Toronto on the 21st Feb 2017. Excellent inflight service. Cabin crew were helpful and friendly. Food was very good and following after another long flight the crew went out of their way to make me feel comfortable. Keep up the good work.",1
"After today's experience I will never fly Frontier again. Staff was rude in the way they spoke to and ordered passengers around from entry gate thru flight. The attendant sat near back bathroom door and when passenger asked if that lavatory was free she said yes, but use the other one. Sat on tarmac waiting for another plane to leave our gate, then another delay before we could exit plane. Girl crying at baggage claim because they lost her bag. Big delay waiting for our checked bag. For a customer oriented service, experience pretty well sucked. Only a cup of water was free on flight if requested. Never again.",0
"Good from LAX to Houston but Houston to Atlanta a complete nightmare. Seats are small had no space with a north face bookbag legs were very uncomfortable seat has almost no cushioning like a race car bucket seat. Had a 7hr layover in Houston which I will never do  again. Once on the plane nothing is complimentary you have to pay for everything, even for water. Once I landed in Atlanta had to walk across the airport because the train was not working or under construction I don't know why it wasn't running but once at baggage claim had to wait 45 mins for my bag will never fly this awful airline again.",0
"Arrived at airport in a timely manner and was told that we were moved up on standby by list. Got told I was number one for 945 flight, didn't make the flight however my better half did. Was put on the 1030 standby list, still number 1 on list, and the agent sends three people ahead of me that were on vacation and worked for Southwest. Unbelievable is all I can say. 1230 flight she puts a guy ahead of me that said he would pay extra. ",0
Chicago to Dublin return in Economy. Orderly boarding in Chicago for a full flight. Friendly and efficient cabin crew who were nicely presented. A lot of babies and small children on this flight but it was nice to see they helped families get settled quickly. Food good quality and lots of water runs during the night. Seatback entertainment very good. Immigration and baggage all fast at Dublin.,1
"Used to be a great airline but they left my husband and an entire plane of people stranded in Juneau, for 2 days, over Thanksgiving. Didn't give him a hotel voucher, won't upgrade seats now that we're traveling back home, nothing. They're ""not responsible"", and their desk agents suck in terms of customer service. I've had better flights and customer service on Spirit.",0
Split to Manchester. Yet another delay from EasyJet and unnecessary lie and misinformation. Flight delay for two hours informed technical problem when technical problem was in the morning. The airline knew all day that it will be late so it was no reason to lie and misinform making everyone wait in overfilled airport.,0
"I had a ticket for this flight to fly to Dubai to join a cruise so it was imperative that I fly in time for the cruise departure. On checking their web site I noticed the flight was no longer listed. I then called their office in Istanbul and they informed me the flight was cancelled. I then sent an email to flydubai in Dubai and they assured me that my flight will depart on that date. I explained to them that I must depart on that particular date because of the cruise. They again assured me the flight will depart, A week before departure I received a message the flight was cancelled and after some correspondence they agreed to give me a refund. Well that was a year ago and I am still waiting for that refund. I have written to then on a number of occasions and every time I am told they are working on my refund. flydubai is nothing but a bunch of thieves and liars, a very dishonest company. How is it possible for airline like this to get accreditation with IATA?",0
"Las Vegas to Oakland. This airline was delayed on both routes, and had horrible service. The flight out was delayed 2 hours prior to boarding, then another hour once boarded due to issues ""getting the plane started"". The flight back was delayed due to another delayed flight ""taking our plane"". We had to wait for another flight to land and send us back to our destination. Despite what appears to be a cheap ticket, it's not worth the ridiculous fees or the travel disruption.",0
"London to Washington. Great flight left on time and arrived early. Pleasant and helpful staff who seemed to enjoy their work, excellent food options and hot and cold drinks offered frequently with nice alcohol options if required. Very comfortable seats with adequate leg room. Overall a fantastic experience.",1
Flight TS 535 July 26th Gatwick to Toronto and returned on flight TS222 August 13th Toronto to Gatwick. Staff very helpful and polite. Great comfortable flight. Wish Air Transat flew to other countries we would use them every time.,1
Flew Delta Air Lines from Los Angeles to Phoenix. Terrible judgement. They had half the plane gate check their bags when there was room in the overhead bins. This cost me 30 minutes on the destination side and caused me to miss my evening plans. Whoever came up with such a short sighted policy or made the decision should be punished. On top of this the seats are tightly spaced my knees heavily abutt the seat in front of me. This airline is very poorly run in my opinion.,0
"It was a scary flight under the pandemic, flight attendants couldn't keep control of certain passengers that kept taking off their masks. Also, we had an incident where a flight attendant was blocking seats for another passenger and would not let us sit in the last row of economy to allow a young lady sleep the long 17 hour flight, and my wife was asked to change seats also to accommodate another young lady. It was reported to the supervisor and head of stewardess, it was not a good experience. Deplaning was disorderly, I have experienced how carriers do disembarking by rows and requesting passengers not to get up until their row is called, in this flight everyone was just pushing to get out, like there was no pandemic. Reported to Emirate, but it seems they did not take the complaint seriously.",0
Melbourne to Phuket via Kuala Lumpur. Just want to say we were pleasantly surprised. We had not flown Air Asia before but the cabin crew and a special mention to Joyce who was very friendly consistently smiling throughout the 8 hour flight and helpful.,1
"Amarillo to Edmonton via Denver. Worst airline I've ever flown. Extremely bad on time performance. My flight from AMA to DEN was delayed for over 3 hours which would have resulted in me missing my connection in Denver. I had to reroute through Houston and ended up over 5 hours late. Every airline has delays but I have had more flight delays due to mechanical issues on United than any other airline by a large margin, both in total number and percentage. I bring an extra change of cloth when flying United because i can never trust it will get me to my destination on the same day. Only reason I still occasionally fly United is due to limited selection of airline to several smaller airports I have to fly into for work. I would never fly United for any personal trips nor would I recommend this airline to anyone else. To me, if i can't get there by another way, it is not worth going. Even for work, I am seriously considering flying into other airports up to 5 hours away on Delta and drive from there. It is that bad.",0
I wouldn't recommend the airline at all. We experienced a delay of more than 6 hours without notification and without giving regular updates. Also the airline lack basic service that you would normally find even in the low cost companies. We have booked through SATA because it has a monopoly for now of direct flight from Paris to Azores.,0
"Munich to Rome. I have been rescheduled to the flight of Eurowing on 22rd March from Munich to Rome, as my LH flight on 21st Mar in the evening left Munich without us, due to delay. But our plane took off exactly on time, I discovered that the space between the rows was even little bit more vs regular LH planes I fly. The service was perfect, the cabin crew was very polite and attentive. So my message is that there are also many positive experiences with Eurowings and the low rating here can be in a way misleading.",1
"Mumbai to Delhi. Vistara had been my preferred domestic airline for the past two years since I flew it for the first time. It's on time performance, new and clean aircraft, fantastic service, good food, etc has made it my favourite. The website and app is simple and user friendly. I am impressed with its frequent flyer programme where the points accrued seem to be more than other airlines. Staff are courteous and the systematic boarding gives a feel good factor right from the beginning of the journey. Food served is nice and hot. Leg space is good and arguably the best among domestic airlines. I hope that Vistara is able to increase its fleet size and fly to more number of sectors other than increasing the flights in the current sectors. Also hope that they continue with this wonderful service !",1
"Berlin to Bucharest. They were late and the staff was agitated because of it. They boarded priority travellers first without checking their tickets, so that half of the travellers profited and skipped the line without having the right to do so. We didn't want to ruin our evening, so we didn't object, we just wanted to get home smoothly. After boarding the aircraft and after having found a small space in the cabin storage compartment to store our coats, two late passengers arrived, each of them carrying a rather large suitcase. Without saying anything, the flight attendant took our coats out of the storage compartment from above our heads and into my wife's lap. She then pushed one of the suitcases inside and left. No explanation, no intention of helping us store our coats somewhere else. My wife stood up and tried to store the coats somewhere else. This got the staff angry, because they were keen on making up lost time and wanted to depart as soon as possible. They started shouting through the microphone, urging everybody to take their seats and saying that taking your seat is really easy to do. Not only were we denied our minimal confort, decency and respect, but they were now also offending us in public. When I asked them, during the flight, if their attitude seemed normal to them, they started shouting again and they immediately joined the one I was adressing as to create pressure and intimidate us. It was unbelievably rude and hostile.",0
Hong Kong to London Heathrow. The flight left a little late but the new business class on this 777 was truly exceptional and I enjoyed every moment of the 12 hour flight. I even managed to get 6 hours sleep on what I think is a very comfortable bed. The food was very good with a nice selection the lamb shoulder confit was superb as was the pork which was served as dinner before landing. The wines were good again a good choice. The cabin staff were very professional and helpful always there. Overall a great journey and my new favourite airline for business class.,1
"Booked a flight from London to Paris 2020. Trip was cancelled due to Covid lockdowns. We asked BA staff for refund, told cannot do but will issue vouchers. We stated no good for two elderly people from Australia as would not know when we can travel. Informed no other option and silly vouchers sent. Now they are running out of date and unusable! Have been asking for two years for refund! Many many emails. They keep saying we took vouchers! Had no choice. Does anyone have any other options re complaints! We would be most grateful. Really not fair to just take our money!",0
Feb 16 2014 I am in Las Vegas stranded. Flight was scheduled for noon. Got here 2 hours early as recommended my flight was delayed due to mechanical issues until 4.41 now looking at 5.41. No email was sent to advise me of the delay. No help at all. I will have been here 8 hours with nobody to help us. They cannot even tell me if the plane is in the sky. Can't wait to see what happens. They have me stuck here and nobody wants to tell me anything or even apologize.,0
"Flew Delhi to Almaty with Air Astana. Excellent service, the aircraft was well maintained and they exceed our expectations on ground too. Even though we had a technical glitch with the aircraft they were super fast to resolve it.",1
Today I was on a connecting flight with Air Canada from Boston to Vancouver through Toronto. The flight to Toronto was delayed and I asked whether I would be able to make the connection which I was assured I would. On landing in Toronto I made it to my connecting gate 20 minutes before takeoff and they had already removed me from the flight. Colleagues who arrived at the gate behind me were not removed from the flight. The explanation from customer service was that they were in business class and I was flying economy. Needless to say the flight I was on and made the connection to was now full as was the next flight making me late for a meeting this evening.,0
"Terrible service in the Qantas Lounge and also had to suffer poorly managed flight cancellations. Lodged a complaint about this matter. Eight weeks later, no response to my complaint. Seems to me that Qantas is happy to provide a lousy service whilst totally ignoring the complaints of its customers. Obviously, this airline feels it can get away with this due to lack of competition in the domestic market. If only there were more competition in the domestic market as this airline would deservedly go out of business.",0
"Montreal to Puerto Plate via Toronto. The airline cancelled my trip the very next day I booked it to postpone it from May till June. Now, they postponed it till July. The worst part is that you can't get a refund so we can look into other airlines. Totally unacceptable.",0
"The airport is relatively quiet. Many stores are still closed. My airline had a good service. The staff on board were in a good mood, smiling, and service minded. Economy seat is comfortable enough for me.",1
"The customer service is awful, they charge you even the water, the suitcases at a ridiculous price, the seats are the most uncomfortable that I have tried in my life. The worst of all is that they always make mistakes and their excuse is ""the new agents are not well prepared, it's their fault"" buying a ""cheap"" ticket can be very expensive. I do not recommend it at all!",0
"I flew China Southern Airlines to Zhengzhou from Melbourne via Guangzhou on Valentine's Day. The cabin was full of holiday atmosphere. Flight attendants were handing out gifts to the kids. When we got Guangzhou, there were too many people trapped in the customs and way too many time I had wasted. I really hope they can divert those crowd under similar circumstances in the future. Thus people who has connecting flights can have more time to transit.",1
"Perth to London via Doha with Qatar Airways, and cannot fault them. It was a great experience to fly with them. The seats have so much room and comfort, the food is amazing, inflight entertainment with so many options! Our luggage all arrived safe and sound after the stopover. Don't have anything bad to say about our experience.",1
"Philly Atlanta Sarasota and back. Out was an MD88 and MD90. Had a bad ankle. Gate agents allowed early boarding on both flights. FAs all friendly. Basic service no complaints. All flights all on time aircraft clean and plenty of room at 5' 10"". Return was MD90 and a 757. Again friendly gate agents and FAs flights all on time and overall good service. As an AE platinum card holder got free checked bag each way.",1
Very bad. They don't even have baggage counters. Arrived airport 4 hrs prior to departure time and we had to wait till 1.5 hrs before departure time. They did baggage and quick check in at the last minute in a hurried manner. Had to run with wife,0
"Third class airline. My Boarding card showed Gate no. 27, When I reached, I saw no one, Then I asked a crew member they sent me to D4 Terminal, When I reached there, they again sent me to D11 gate and said because of the system they are changing the gate. When I reached, they closed the gate and the flight was gone by that time. I had to catch another flight. I went to American airline counter, The lady was so rude on D Terminal. When I requested for help she stopped me in a conversation and said ""if you use one more word I am not going to help you, then said why didn't you choose another airline and finally she totally damaged my whole route. I was in Miami with no help, No hotels no food they gave me. Then Qatar airways helped me and said American airlines cancelled my whole route when they were reissuing my ticket. I had so much trouble that I never faced. I have travelled many countries with different airlines. I think American Airlines crews learn from any Asian countries airlines how to deal with customer, behavior and hospitability. Never forget, We pay for the service, not granted.",0
"Was supposed to leave Vegas at 8.03 and have a quick 2 hour flight. Opted out of paying to check a bag so I just paid the 9 dollars to take a carry on bag. Flight left as scheduled, flew for 30 minutes and then a Gauge stopped working, so they turned around and went back to Vegas. Said they would either have it fixed or an answer in 30 minutes. Finally at 9.30 they said they would be working on it to repair and print food ticket vouchers for everyone at 10 if it still wasn't fixed. 10 am and went 10.30 came and went with still no word. 11 they finally said wait 30 minutes and they would start loading the plane. 11.30 loaded half the plane and then unloaded it as something still wasn't right. At 12 12 they gave food vouchers, good for a whole 8 dollars. The whole time the flight crew were rude, no explanation, nothing. Finally got word that the new plane would be in at 1.30 and we would be on it. Finally at 2.30 we leave. They did give 50 dollar voucher, good for one year on an Allegiant flight. I'll never fly with them again so that's a waste. ",0
"Wizz Air is a Hungarian airline, and Hungarian websites have some catching up to do in terms of navigability, functionality, etc. Wizz Air's website has a penchant for resetting certain selections unexpectedly. When my boarding pass emerged with the wrong flight time on it within minutes of booking it, it took an hour on the phone and 40 Euros to fix the problem. There was no opportunity for escalation or to avoid these charges to correct a problem caused by their website. Do yourself a favor and use another carrier.",0
"Gatwick to Reykjavik. Yesterday travelling with WOW air with a backpack of 30 litres which usually fit as hand luggage, this time the lady on the desk made me pay 74GBP for my luggage, being rude to me and saying that if I ask again, why I have been charged, I won't travel. She send me to put my backpack on the sizer, which I did. Then it stuck with one of the straps, I just went put it in again because obviously this is not a hard case and it doesn't fit in the same way in the sizer, but she told me that should fit without pushing, obviously I wasn't pushing, but she didn't want to listen and said that I had to pay for my backpack. I'm very dissapointed with this company, and this is the first time that happen to me. I don't think I will fly with this company again, it was a very bad experience.",0
"Travel through Qatar has been very smooth and it was extra special during these times. Very clean airport and aircraft, super courteous staff. Good food and nice choices of meals. The Qatar app is an added bonus. I really like the baggage notifications that reassures the status of your baggage.",1
"I will keep it short. Delays, delays. Cancellations. Zero customer service. Hour and a half on hold. If I can't afford to fly in a real airline, I won't travel. Worst airline ever.",0
Moscow to St Petersburgh. A new A350 plane with business class suites. They have a bad pillow which I do not find comfortable and a a bad blanket.,0
6th May from LHR flight VN50. Return flight on 19th May from Hanoi flight VN55. I was very dissatisfied from the moment we entered the plane cabin staff were very unhelpful bordering on rude the plane on our outward trip was almost empty so the crew had little to do. I was expecting to have regular water or juices offered but this did not happen and on such a long flight it was needed. Delivery of food was an interruption into their rest time and the lack of English language was not good so communication was very difficult the plane was quite old and the seats very uncomfortable with very little leg room. The return flight was full so it was even more uncomfortable the service was just as bad and the screen on my seat was broken and just flashed throughout the flight. I asked the crew member for help and got a shrug and she put the magazine over the seat and that was it! I will never choose this airline again unless they improve their planes and train staff to a reasonable standard. I have never heard so many complaints by passengers on a flight before.,0
Oklahoma City to Orlando. This airline is horrible they canceled my flight all day to Florida and then my flight back to OKC was delayed 3 hours. I sat and watched other flights go out but the one my family and I were going to be on. Will not fly with them again. They had us board in MCO and sat there for a while and then deplaned us for 45 mins.,0
Worst airline in India. Always late unapologetic staff. Consistent terrible experience. Not sure why they are allowed to operate at all. Will never fly this airline again,0
Riyadh to Istanbul. They rescheduled my flight with the short notice and I had to stay at the airport for four hours waiting for my flight and I had to pay extra money. On top of that I arrived four hours later then my expected arrival where I had to take a taxi instead of my brother picking me up. In the airplane I wanted to charge my phone but there was no outlet nor USB port.,0
"Alaska Airlines is the best, they provide complimentary drinks, including beer and wine. Service is offered a couple of times even on a short 1.5 hour flight.  The flight attendants are friendly, courteous, and professional.",1
"Frankfurt to Banjul, Our flight got cancelled and the airline didn't provide any help and it took two days till we were back home. The airline should seriously think about their service level and how they treat their customers. It was awful. I would never recommend this airline!",0
"I was on an Air Canada Rouge flight from Venice to Toronto May 2014. The plane had no TV's and customers are expected to download an air Canada app in advance to their own smart phones i pads etc. They rent ipads for those without their own. The stewardess spent much of of the trip trying to trouble shoot problems with access to the system. Most people gave up and spent 10 hours with nothing to watch. That makes for a very long flight and makes the assumption that everyone is travelling with such a mobile device and wants to watch tv on their phone screen. This is not good customer service for such long flights. Also unless you had accessed the app before your flight it would not run movies or TV shows. Despite over an hour delay taking off in Venice to Toronto no Air Canada rep bother to advise travellers to download it in advance from the Venice airport internet service. Also there are no ""new releases"" in the movie options. The movies are ""classics"" and as old as the ruins in Rome. The flight was late back into Toronto and we were given incorrect info from the crew as to the gate for our flight connection in Toronto and we had to complete our journey standby.",0
"The A321neo was fully booked, I got an emergency exit row seat, cabin crew was professional and very cordial, the aircraft was well cleaned and new. Can't really say anything bad this time.",1
"The quality of food offered was quite satisfactory but the amount of it left me hungry. After using a Business Class washroom and walking the length of the plane to stretch  my legs, I was followed by a male flight attendant who stated that I was not entitled to use this washroom. He never inquired where I was seated. The purser had to intervene on my behalf and call that flight attendant to order.",0
"Zurich to Venice. This airline has no customer service. It is a fine airline if nothing goes wrong. Once something goes wrong the airline will not help you. They lost my luggage and began pointing fingers at the airport I arrived in and United because my flight got rebooked. However, it is stated on the Swiss website that they claim responsibility for your luggage once you check it. I have been in Italy for 6 days and have no clothes!",0
"Just one stop from Las Vegas to Los Angeles. It got delayed for 3 hours. I could have driven easily. No proper update. No back up flight. I've faced delays with American Airlines, but they somehow managed to arrange an alternate flight without much delay! I won't fly Spirit anymore.",0
Flight EK225. Dubai to San Francisco. Airbus 380. Pathetic and Rude Infight service. Basic reply there are 400 plus passengers and 8 crew members only. If crew are short staffed is it a passenger problem? Terrible service at baggage claim more than 2 hours. Reason short staff.,0
"Terrible airline. Would not recommend to anyone. Every single flight was delayed, causing us to miss connections. No food or vouchers were offered, sometimes having to wait in the airport for 10 hours without food. One of our flights randomly landed in Azerbaijan to refuel, adding an additional two hours to the flight time. The flight itself was uncomfortable, no entertainment, one meal served in 9 hours which was bland. Only water available as a drink. Seats dated and uncomfortable. Staff were generally rude and unhelpful, both at the airport and on the flight itself. Additionally, for some reason the plane that was used was small and we felt every small bit of turbulence. Would never fly with Ukraine International again. I don't have one good thing to say about them.",0
Omaha to Los Angeles. I wanted to thank the American Airlines staff. I face many health issues and fly with my emotional support dog and in many cases they have went above and beyond to help me. Today they kindly asked someone to switch seats with me as they had more leg room for my dog. This is something I was not expecting as my dog and I make it work each time. The person was not very happy but I appreciated it more than they both will ever know. I always choose American Airlines and this is an example of why they stand out.,1
Very good meal on a regular 1 hour flight. Cabin members very polite and nicely dressed. Legroom is okay. Aircraft is regular not brand new. More expensive then other companies.,1
"I can't believe what a dissapointment this company has became, I had a flight from NYC to Memphis, on Friday 12th, my flight was cancelled at the last minute without any explanation. I catch a early flight in the morning of the 13th, then I have my return flight from Memphis to NYC on the 14TH June. When I got to DCA my flight was delayed and as always at the last minute they cancelled my flight, they didn't even give us a hotel room., I slept at the airport thinking I would leave the airport first thing in the morning, to my surprise I didn't, they put me on another flight with US Airways which was the same, as I was waiting for my flight, they cancelled again, then they put me on an AA flight leaving at 9.47 am and now is leaving at 10.",0
"Flight was canceled just hours before with no explanation. We were supposed to have a layover in Zurich for 20 hours where we booked accommodations and had to forfeit the cost because we were rerouted to Singapore for a later flight. This meant we now had to wait at the Male Airport for 12 hours before our next flight! I tried to call Swiss Airlines multiple time, but waited for 2 hours and still no answer. Since a phone call was useless, I wrote at least 4 different complaints on their site and only received 1 email a month later which basically said you're out of luck.",0
"Melbourne to London via Dubai. On the 6th January 2016 we missed our flight from Melbourne to London. We were served by a very helpful lady at the Qantas sales desk in Melbourne, who after a period of time was able to get us on another flight to London. We are very thankful to this lady, as without her excellent customer service we would not have been able to return to the UK. Thank you very much.",1
"On November 6 2014 flew from West Palm Beach to Las Vegas via Atlanta in Business Select. Had not flow SW in years but it is apparent the service has deteriorated. The open seating is a joke and as well as the Business Select status. Pre Boards get the best seats which are clearly exit rows and the first row. I was traveling with someone who is 6'3"" and 275lbs. and it was torture for them to sit in a very small seat with no leg room to elbow room and hard seats. Staff are rude and have poor attitudes.",0
"Booked Edinburgh to Barcelona return flights in August 2016 for my family to travel in July 2017. In October 2016 I receive an email saying flight has been changed, not only to a very late flight but on completely different day. Completely unworkable for a family with young kids. I phoned customer services to cancel, they offered a refund which I accepted. Six weeks later still no sign of my refund and despite three calls I've been unable to get through to their customer service department. I was flying out with other parties who also booked with them, and have had similar refund issues. Apparently they 'forgot' to issue the refund. They've now been sitting with my money now for 7 months on the false promise of flights that didn't even exist. Meanwhile I've had the extra expense of booking flights else where.",0
Flying constantly from Regina to Vancouver I have never had any problems. I make that flight maybe every 5 weeks or so and I have yet to be disappointed. My last flight was from Chicago into Calgary and even at my lowest moment when I thought I was going to miss my flight the WestJet agents were so helpful that I made it to my flight with time remaining still.,1
"Worst Customer service I have experienced, ever. Its been more than 6 months and still not been able to fully recover refund for cancelled flight back in March 2020. Every time you call, you get told different information, no reply to emails. Eventually received some funds, but not the full amount due to their error, It takes another 14 to 20 working days apparently to receive funds, so after waiting long again, its quite disappointing to find out only tiny amount has been refunded again, another error. Why do I have to beg for money that I am entitled to? Avoid if you can",0
"Malaga to Nis via Weeze. Nice flight as usual with FR. I usually have no problem with low cost airlines, as I do not expect much, as the price I usually pay for my flights are less then 100 eur. In particular this flight coast me 60 eur. I really hate that FA goes around and try to sell whatever they can. I usually get some snack, this time I tried their ham and cheese sandwich as I was hungry and was not that bed, except they heat it with the paper so the paper got glued to sandwich. Otherwise from 40 flights I had with them none of them was canceled or delayed.",1
I traveled from Minneapolis to New York and didn't have to check my suitcase at all. Then on my way back to Minneapolis I had to check my bag at LaGuardia airport in NY. I don't understand why I have to check my bag on the way back but not on the way there. The baggage people were not the nicest and it definitely wasn't an ideal situation. I had to pay a fee that I wasn't planning on paying and I shouldn't have had to pay it. From this experience I would not fly United Airlines again.,0
"Manchester to Lanzorote. We booked our flight with TUI but they changed to Privilege because of an issue. I had a 1 year old and 6 year old with me. The staff on board were amazing! They were friendly, great with my children and when my 1 year old was crying before take off they came to play with her distracting her. My 1 year old went to the front to play with the staff at one point of the flight. I found the seat comfort fine, it was clean and just what I expected. If I knew the names of these staff I would have contacted the airline direct and thanked them personally.",1
"I do not recommend Frontier Airlines. They cancelled our flight a couple of hours before boarding. They had no explanation as to why either. When we attempted to rebook with another airline using their booking system the booking system confirmed 3 out of the 4 tickets only. There was no customer service number to call to try to confirm my minor child's seat in the new flight. So we had to spend over an hour at the Southwest ticket counter to try to get my young child the same flight as us. We then had to take a later flight and pay for the new airline tickets out of pocket. We are hoping they will reimburse us for it, but I have no faith in that company.",0
First time with KLM. KL to Amsterdam on B777 Amsterdam To Abu Dhabi on A330. Both flights were full. The seats were typical economy so nothing flash. The cabin crew were really friendly and proactive throughout both flights. Water and or juice was offered quite frequently a courtesy bar area was available with drinks and snacks ie help yourself not that you needed it because staff were very attentive to requests. Food was ok with staff working well as a team when some options were short on supply. All flights were right on time. I flew on with them to and out and of Norwich. Anyone travelling into England might chose this to avoid Heathrow. I was in my hire car 15 minutes after arriving in Norwich. I would fly with KLM again.,1
"Singapore to Seoul via Kuala Lumpur. Flight from Singapore to Kuala Lumpur delayed by 2.5hrs. Passengers who had connecting flights, or meetings begged the staff at the MH transit counter to put them on a Singapore Airlines code sharing flight which was refused. I was lucky enough that I had 4hr layover in Kuala Lumpur. Flight to KL was on a rather tired looking Boeing 737. FA's were rather robotic and not overly friendly. Golden Lounge in KL was still under renovation despite different information given on the MH website claiming that it opened on the 20th  February. Replacement lounge shockingly basic. Service on the long flight was similar as on the short flight. Food and seat was decent. Flight arrived on time, IFE poor. MH has been constantly on the decline over the last few years, but this was the new low point due to the handling with the delay, and the not very friendly staff.",0
Lisbon to Washington via Paris. Absolutely terrible service. Was stuck in Paris and was repeatedly lied to. We were told that we were going to be bussed to an airport hotel because of the storm. They sent us to a hotel at Disney more than 45 kilometers from the airport. They provided no transportation back to the airport which ended up being very expensive. My baggage was lost. Customer service was terrible throughout. Not an ounce of compassion or even a hint of an apology. Just poor and arrogant customer service.,0
"Philadelphia to Denver, and this is my first time flying with American Airlines and I will never fly with them again. I had to have my name changed on my ticket going to to my initial flight and I was in the customer service line. I was yelled at by three different employees in the Denver airport to go print my boarding pass at a kiosk, which I had already done. Then, with my departing flight from Philadelphia, I had to pay for my checked bag with cash. A very nice employee directed me to the correct line. I was standing there for a little while and then a woman behind the desk starts staring at me, yelling at me to go print my boarding pass at a kiosk. I have never ever been treated this way when I am just trying to get on to my flight.  I understand that the kiosks make things easier for everyone, but employees should be trained in being polite to customers to find out what they are in line for before shouting at them. Or at least hire friendlier people if it's that difficult.",0
Horrible customer service. After being on hold for hours on end not a single agent was able to assist in changing my flight time. Completely incompetent and unhelpful staff who cannot process a single email. Will never recommend this airlines and never use it again.,0
"At the right gate. No information about riding a bus 50 before departure. That was not the case when leaving Slc to Seattle. Missed the flight because of the extra time for boarding added on that was not disclosed. Also the announcements are really hard to understand. Talk as fast as you can with mush in your mouth is the norm. Plus echoing makes it hard to hear announcements Let's upgrade the speaker system. They got us on another flight and it was much appreciated. Lost four hours of life waiting. However, agent never bothered to tell us second flight moved to a different gate and this change was not on the ticket he printed. Luckily we asked another agent. Had to book it to the other side of the Seattle Airport to make it to Medford.",0
"I had flight from Palma de Mallorca to Larnaca with transfer in Budapest. Wizz air changed the time of the flight from Palma to Budapest with few hours, so I was gonna lose the flight from Budapest to Larnaca. I tried to contact them, but no answer on the phone, no email of them, so I called to the airport of Larnaca and they told me that the only option I have is to change my flight from Budapest to Larnaca with 12 hours, for the next day and pay the fee 35 euro. So I had to stay all night on the airport and wait for my flight. I had important meeting in the morning in larnaca, so I couldn't wait for it. I decided to buy another ticket, of course with another company. Well Wizz air didnt refund me money, couldn't change the date of the ticket for free, even though was theirs fault and I paid more money for my new ticket. I will never fly with Wizz Air again, the worst company ever. There is no way you can contact them every change u want to make on your ticket u have to pay 35 euro, even if u want to cancel it. This cheap ticket with wizz air became so expensive.",0
"Mary and Ann on flight from Calgary to Toronto in October 2019, delayed but such great personality! Great communication and outstanding customer service. Thank you for keeping me smiling during an extended boarding delay.",1
"A long time since I have traveled with Monarch and I have to say very impressed. Nice roomy, clean modern aircraft, friendly and attentive crew on both journeys, and on time departures. Aircraft back from Malaga had the new slimline seats, again very impressed and you didn't feel cramped. They have taken the ridiculous and pointless seat reclining buttons out as with the ergonomic design of the new seat it makes you feel reclined anyway. Only gripe is boarding process a bit long winded, special assistance first, then frequent flyers and priority boarding, then adults with children under 5 then finally a free for all to the gate. When are airlines going to start using both front and rear doors even if they are using airbridges? I have seen it done at Faro airport and it works really well and stops the long winded fracas of everybody getting on one entrance and causing chaos in the cabin. ",1
"Connecting flight from KUL to CMB. Boarding started ahead of scheduled time, something that we don't see normally. As we boarded, we were greeted and directed to our seats. The cabin crew were very friendly and helpful. Captain did a great job welcoming the passengers and briefing. Inflight service was excellent and a range of movies and TV shows to choose from. Meals were amazing. Departed on time and arrived on time. ",1
"This was the worst flying experience I have ever had. They were short staffed with pilots so they cancelled the Austin leg of our flight because of the time constraints we were forced to spend 24 hours at the airport and after three failed attempts to put on standby flights and showing no empathy I finally got on a flight to Vegas with my wife and two kids one of them 6 years old. He is emotionally scared now from the frustration, also when we arrived in Vegas they switched our baggage claim 3 times.",0
Flight from London to Delhi via Moscow was cancelled on the day of departure. They put me on an alternate flight on the same route that departed several hours later and included a 12 hour stop in Moscow rather than a 3 hour one. I requested a Vegetarian meal and had this verified prior to the initial cancellation of my flight. No one at Aeroflot bothered to transfer this request to the replacement flight and that flight didn't carry any vegetarian meals. I received some meal tokens to spend in the airport however the value of the tokens was pathetic by any measure. The only eatery open was TGI Fridays and the only vegetarian option there was soup which I ordered with a glass of orange juice. These two meagre items not only came to more than the amount I had in tokens but required me to pay several Euros too! The level of English of Aeroflot staff is terrible for an international airline.,0
Krakow to Frankfurt. Very good airline with excellent service. Everything was on time and well organized. All of the employees I came in contact were great to deal with. Definitely will fly with them again.,1
"Guangzhou to San Francisco.  Boarding was smooth, and they provided drinks while waiting in front of gates. The flight departed on time. It was a long flight but it was comfortable. The flight attendants smile and answer questions patiently. The director of the flight attendants saw we two old people traveling alone. She showed special care to us, asked if we are comfortable, and helped us with any questions regarding the travel, and especially with those questions on the custom forms. The SFO people guided us to the right direction and there are people organizing at the baggage claim. They are helping in Chinese, provided huge help for us who do not speak English.",1
"Not heeding the advice of all the bad reviews for this airline, we purchased tickets given the good price. We were notified the day prior to the departure that the flight was cancelled. No explanation and just told a refund would be issued.",0
Tarom is better than expected and they offer a business class. The contract lounge in Munich is very nice. The flight was on time and the crew was friendly. The airplane was empty and the flight was on time. The seat is a standard economy class seat with the middle seat kept free. Food and seat good. Nothing to complain. I would fly them again  considering the value for a business class ticket.,1
"I'm so happy to chose Garuda as my airlines from Tokyo to Bali, the plane was a new one, the seat was comfortable and a lot of space even in economy class. They gave me really good service, the cabin crew was really nice, they are always smiling and always gonna be there really fast if you need something.",1
Merimbula to Sydney. This was my first trip with this airline and overall the experience was a positive one. Check in at Merimbula was efficient and polite. Boarding was on time and the hostess for our trip was extremely charming  smiling and chatting to passengers throughout the flight. Once in Sydney we were quickly bussed to the terminal and there was a very short wait for bags. Also found their fares quite reasonable if you book far enough ahead.,1
I was traveling with my fiance and mother from NZ to Manchester in April 2014. On the SYD to AUH flight I had a live crawling beetle in my salad. I alerted cabin crew who attempted to remove it and return my salad to me! After following up the whole flight she finally said she had submitted an incident report. On the AUH to MAN flight the cabin staff gave our vegetarian meal to the family behind us. They started eating it and then the staff realised they had made a mistake so they removed the meal from the family behind us and gave it straight to us. The staff never returned when we requested water and it usually took 3 or 4 times until we got water. When I laid a complaint to the head office they offered my free guest miles and we stand by our great service and are offering you these guest miles. And that was it.,0
"New York to Tel Aviv via Istanbul was on time, as were 4 segments of my itinerary. Cabin staff solicitous ,helpful and polite. Catering out of JFK was particularly good, the onboard ""chefs"" a nice touch even if they really aren't preparing much fresh food. We were seated on the side, 2 abreast, which was good as the center section of 3 across does not look appealing. The seats are relatively open, not affording much privacy, but the amount of storage is more than very sufficient, and the seat comfort when in the flat position, including the ""bedpad"", comforter and pillow more than adequate. The lounge in Istanbul was quite good, being on two levels with many interesting and well prepared food stations. We were also given two private sleeping rooms in the lounge for our 5 hour transit, a very nice touch. All in all, Turkish seems to offer a solid business class product, superior to US airlines in staff attitude, on time performance, speed of baggage delivery and overall efficiency.",1
This was the first time we had flown with Ryanair flying from Leeds Bradford to Corfu. We had heard so many negative comments about this airline but we speak as we find and everything about this airline was excellent. We pre booked our seats and when we approached the seats they had reserved on them. We have never had so much leg room we also found the seats to be comfy. The aircraft left on time and arrived in Corfu early. When we landed we had a trumpet played to us apparently this is always done when a flight arrives on time or is early. The plane was spotlessly clean and to be quite honest looked brand new. The people working on the plane were extremely courteous and very very smart. I would not hesitate in recommending Ryanair to anyone.,1
"Kona to Phoenix. Awful experience on an aging, dirty poorly equipped plane. Seat had almost no room, very narrow. The legroom even though I paid for extra was awful and inadequate. The graphic showed when you select your seat was inaccurate and did not represent the leg room available on the plane. I got no satisfaction when I complained to AA. I'm even an AA Advantage credit card member, have a frequent flyer account as well and that meant nothing to them.",0
Travelled from Sydney to Seoul to London return and was impressed. London legs were on clean new B777s with large touchscreens and lots of movies. Added bonus of comfortable seats and space. 777 on the Sydney legs were also clean but very old and ptvs were small and grainy. Seats were still comfortable for 10 hours but substandard entertainment made it feel longer. Asiana should realise their Sydney route is just as much a competitive and long haul route as their European and US flights and worthy of the same standard of new planes. Service food and amenities were outstanding on all flights and the crew were a standout.,1
"Edinburgh to Tenerife. Excellent flight out and back for a week's winter sunshine in Tenerife. Flight was on time on the way out and early on the way back. The outbound flight was a very new looking plane, smart interior, clean and very comfortable. The free WiFi is an amazing plus, made the time go past quickly. Cabin crew were friendly and efficient. Sadly the stock of items for sale from the food section was very limited or non existent. Must try harder on this score. On the way home the crew was slightly frosty with no welcome when embarking. However it didn't really detract from an excellent, comfortable, on time flight. Will definitely fly with them again.",1
"Absolutely horrible experience. I booked a ticket from Expedia for a British Airways Operated flight from Madrid to Belfast with a changeover at London Heathrow. The whole itinerary was listed as BA although the Madrid to London flight was Iberia. On Jan 22nd, London was experiencing cold and fog. The Iberian flight sat on the tarmac for 2 hours in Madrid because of the London weather. Upon landing in Terminal 3, I had to take a bus to Terminal 5. The flight was the last flight to Belfast for the evening and it had already taken off. The BA desk was swamped with people as many people had to spend the night due to the weather. The British Airways staff said that we could go book any hotel up to 200 pounds and we would be reimbursed. I was barely able to find a room and had to take an expensive cab. However when trying to get the reimbursement, BA said it wasn't their problem and that it was Iberia's problem. Iberia said they do not reimburse due to the weather. When complaining to BA, they said they only market the flight as BA and that they refuse to reimburse. Absolutely disgusting behavior by the airline to not take any responsibility for a flight that they were using their name to sell it to people but don't want to take responsibility for it. Did they expect me to take the bus back to Terminal 3? Their people gave out false information.",0
"Los Angeles to Cairns via Sydney. During a 3 week trip to Australia and New Zealand we took at least 9 trips on different Qantas aircraft. We always had wonderful service, friendly staff, good food including yummy ice cream and chocolates, clean bathrooms, and modern aircraft including the A380 and Boeing 737. We especially loved the A380 which was roomy and did not feel crowded even with 482 souls onboard. Boarding and deplaning was seamless. Puts American legacy airlines to shame. Best airline we've flown!",1
" via Dubai with flydubai. All 4 flights delayed. They lost my stroller. I was assured that the stroller will be sent to my hotel. Nothing happened. The stroller was on the Airport 4 hours after my arrival, but after 6 days flydubai wrote me, that they will start to look for it. I had to go to the airport on my own. I asked for any compensation, but without any answer.",0
"Me and my wife requested a Vegetarian meal but I was shocked to see the first and second meal for myself and my wife are the same. We asked to change the second meal, but they claimed they are out of any extra meal. The flight attendant gave us the white cover to put on our table.",0
"Madrid to Paris. A few days before the flight, when I tried to check in online, I realised my tickets had ""0 pieces of luggage"" included. I went to check in at the airport and my suitcase was only 14 kgs but I had to pay 40EUR and my credit card didn't work. Staff at the counter offered no help or support.  The Air France staff at the Madrid Airport was just bad people to tell it like it is.",0
"Athens to Catania. Direct excellent flight, everything was on schedule, departure, flight time and arrival at Catania Airport. Service was excellent though not enough space in the aircraft. This is why the airplane was fully booked from Italian tourists. I would fly again. I saved valuable time instead of flying via Rome.",1
Our trip was uncomfortable as there was no spacing in between the seats. No one was wearing their mask and there was no social distancing. I would never recommend this flight. This was the worst flight we ever had.,0
"Shanghai to Sydney via Guangzhou. This is the first time I took China Southern Airlines, and I found it very comfortable. The staff on the flight were so helpful and sweet and the space was big enough. The complimentary food on China southern was so tasty.",1
Sydney to Gold Coast on 1st April. Flight delayed 1hr 30 mins. Very disappointing this is my 3 out 4 flights delayed. Terrible time schedule. Very disappointed.,0
"Atlanta to Los Angeles. Frontier Airline is the most disgusting and unprofessional airline of them all I'm convinced. After having our flight delayed minutes before we were scheduled to board and after waiting 2 hours, we learned our flight has been canceled. Their refund policies are horrible and cover little to nothing when it comes to booking another flight. If I were you, I'd stay far away from Frontier as my family and I are not the only ones to have endured this. Also their staff is extremely unprofessional and don't even pretend to be interested in helping you figure out your issue. As I stated before, please avoid this airline. It'll save you a lot of time, money and energy.",0
I took the Manila to Hong Kong route on 19 May 2015 and return leg on 21 May 2015. This flight is a 90 minute flight per leg. The first leg was delayed by 40 mins while the second leg was delayed by 3 hours. Service is normal. Overall I'd give it a fail for the kind of delay I faced.,0
"Athens to Munich. We boarded almost an hour late from Athens to Munich. Once arrived to Munich, we had to run to our gate as they were calling Last call to Washington while we were in passport control. That flight leaves almost 30 minutes late not even because they were waiting for people from the previous flight. My bag didn't make it to Washington, it was still in Athens, two days later still calling about my bag.",0
I took flight from San Jose to Denver on June 2 in frontier 594. Flight attendant blame that weather is bad but it was not. Flight attendants was not helpful at all. Very disappointed with Frontier and never fly again. Flight is canceled and they were giving other flight after 1 week.,0
Newark to Buffalo with United Airlines. Very rude staff at the boarding gate. This is not the first time. Very disappointed. I would never recommend any of my friends and family to this airlines. No respect for customers. They have to teach their staff to respect customers first.,0
"I was flying from Moscow during these hard times, and the Russian Authorities made it complicated for the airline to depart. The plane was about 5hrs late and everybody missed their connection. Air Serbia gave us a hotel, restaurant access and a packed breakfast for those leaving early. They really went out of their way.",1
Bangkok to Singapore. I boarded this beautiful new A350 to a warm welcome from smiling crew and settled into seat 14K. I love the reverse herringbone business class layout on this aircraft. Very private and comfortable seat. Refill of champagne was offered prior to our punctual takeoff. On this short sector the crew did a fantastic job of performing a full lunch service in the limited time frame with a friendly and professional attitude. The food was delicious and I could not fault any aspect of the flight. I can happily recommmend Cathay based on this flight experience.,1
"My wife and I flew Melbourne to Kuala Lumpur with Air Asia X on an Airbus A330. We were in Premier Flex which includes what is called a hot seat in the front row of the child free quiet zone, priority check in, boarding and exiting, 20kg baggage, one hot meal and a bottle of water. Any thing else you pay for. Left and arrived on time, crew fine. Great value for money.",1
"The service was good and the flight attendant was excellent. If memory serves, her name is Eman. She was an amazing flight attendant and she helped me a lot with my aunt, because my aunt needed some extra assistance and Eman was the one who helped her. Her service left a great impression on us which reflected on Qatar Airways in the end and made it as one of the best airways in the world.",1
"Outbound flight was really average. Food is not good, the flight attendants are sluggish and quite rude with customers if you dare asking too many questions, cabin and toilets cleanliness was also quite low. Inbound flight never happened. They have never reimbursed my cancelled return flights since last March. Customer service is non existent and they are refusing to refund flights which were cancelled by them for operational reasons, while in reality it was just a lack of passengers for this flight.",0
"Dublin to Izmir. Spent two hours queuing to check in. Staff at the check in desks were extremely slow and gave no apologies to anyone for the two hour queuing times. The check in staff seemed to be on a go slow and speed was beyond their ability. We all experienced this type of long waits, ten years ago not in 2019. It is embarrassing to see that an Irish company, such as Aer Lingus has not upskilled their staff in many years. We will now try and avoid flying with Aer Lingus.",0
"Absolutely horrendous customer service in Orlando and JetBlue shame on you for allowing your paying customers to sit in the airport for 8hours due to delay after delay, and for what you all said was due to the air planes being used to many time.  Why would you book if you cannot manage that many flights!",0
"This airline should be banned. 3 flights back to back all are delayed. 4 hours, next one 2 hours and last one 2 hours again. Came to Orlando at 1.30 am after 2 hour delay and waiting for luggage another 45 mins. They penny pinch you for everything. Stay away from this airline. Disgusted.",0
"This is the first time we have flown Virgin America and we were really impressed. We usually fly business class on another airline. It was a new plane and we were main cabin select right behind first class. There was not a wall but a colored glass partition. Plenty of room, free food and drinks. Everyone had their own computer for music, movies, tv and to order food and drinks. Food and drinks were free in main cabin select as well as internet until March of next year. Good food, good service, plenty of room. Similar plane on the way home.",1
"Bangalore to Mangalore. This is the worst airline I have seen. no responsibility. They dont care of the customer at all. They changed the schedule of flight departures 6 times in 2 months, and at last cancelled the flight. And they are not even responding to calls and mails. Never recommend this airline.",0
Flew May 2nd from Vancouver to Manchester! I was really pleased with the airline and staff. I have paid a lot more in the past and not received as good a service! My personal TV screen froze halfway through the flight so I couldn't use it but that didn't really bother me as I just went to sleep and no one else seemed to be experiencing the same problem. I am flying back on May 23rd with my dog so that is going to be the worrying part but hopefully everything will go smoothly! I also got option plus would recommend to anyone! Is not that much extra and jut the priority baggage made my trip a lot easier!,1
"Changsha to Seoul via Guangzhou. This is my first time to choose China Southern Airlines. In the flight, they offered breakfast and dinner for me. The options are noodles and rice, also small cookies and nuts. The foods and drinks are free. Inflight entertainment are new movies and musics, but the quality of earphones are not that good. And WiFi was not stable during the flight. In all, when I arrived Korea, I think the whole journey was comfortable. So I will choose China Southern Airlines again in the future.",1
"They had no staff at the front counter when we arrived. After about an hour 2 reps showed up and then one of them left with no explanation and a whole line up of people. When I boarded the plane there was garbage on the seats. We then didn't leave until 20 minutes after our scheduled time because they allowed someone to board the plane with a large stroller and when it wouldn't fit in the carry on cabin, we had to be delayed so they could store it. We only had an hour transfer in Barcelona after this delay so I tried to talk to the attendants about possibly getting off the plane before the others so we could make our flight. They were extremely rude. Luckily we caught our flight but our baggage got lost somewhere en route. ",0
Amsterdam to Naples with Vueling. Way too expensive for the comfort and service that we received. Extremely little space in the aircraft and a 2 hour delay. Staff was unfriendly and customer service is terrible. I've tried to contact them several times but all I got was information coming from a robotic voice. I won't fly with Vueling ever again.,0
"Sao Paulo to Barcelona via Zurich. Perfectly clean cabin, amazing food, I loved the chocolate at the end of the service, the Swiss wine was great as well. During the short flight from Zurich To Barcelona the cheese sandwich was great as well. The staff was very attentive and smiley. Very clear English and even Portuguese some of them. Very professional. To be honest I can say is the best airline I flew with.",1
"Travelled today on a short flight into Gatwick form Verona. Crew first class, courteous and offered good inflight service. For a so called low cost carrier Monarch reigns supreme in all aspects of customer care. It is a pity they do not operate on some longer flights. Keep up the good work.",1
"Baltimore to Miami. I had an issue with American Airlines canceling my flight for November 2018 without my acknowledgement. Was very upset when I called, the agent Nina helped me right away. Fixed my flight and was very helpful. Customer service was great. Handled my issue right away. Thank you Nina for all your help through my stressful moment!",1
"New York JFK to Tokyo via Shanghai. I had a great experience with China Eastern. My flight was cancelled together with other flights on the night of blizzard in NYC, and the airport was in chaos the next day many people were on the standby and I almost could not be rescheduled to the next flight that allows me to be in Tokyo before important meetings and my friend's wedding. They put us into the flight with different airport from our original flight that is closer to the city for no additional charge. I originally had 7hr layover but it was also gone. They were quick and efficient with attitude to not make us worry. I sincerely appreciated their effort.",1
"I have had a very bad experience with Air Canada. I was flying round trip from London to Toronto late last year and they completely destroyed my luggage. After a rude encounter with the Air Canada lady at Toronto airport I had to go through months of unanswered emails and calls to try and sort out the situation. Eventually they agreed to refund me for my damaged baggage 3 months later. However, they would only send me a compensation in a Canadian bank account, which of course I don't have as I am a tourist. I explained this over multiple emails and calls, but nothing happened. I was told repeatedly to just be patient and they would contact me when they could find the time! That never happened. The voucher for the compensation expired and they never answered my demands for an alternative payment type. It has now been over 6 months and I have lost all faith. I believe they never intended to compensate me or indeed any other foreigner. I am convinced that if I was a Canadian they would have compensated me ages ago.",0
"I want to strongly recommend the Disabled Persons Services employee, Kevin, who helped transport me across three terminals at LAX this week. He is personable, efficient, and highly competent at his job. We really needed someone like him that morning.",1
I was flying with Norwegian on October 15th 2018 from Helsinki to Malaga. It was the most horrible flight in my life! The cabin crew was extremely unfriendly. Not even hello or goodbye. I asked two of the flight attendants if it was possible to change my window seat because im a little bit aerophobic and feel dizzy when I sit next to the window but they just ignored me! Horrible service. Would never recommend to fly with them.,0
Flew LIS to GIG economy 23 December. Long wait on bus at gate before long drive to plane and long wait on bus again before boarding. At first it looked like there was adequate space in seat but then seat in front of me was fully reclined for 9 hours squashing me into my seat unable to use tray table or watch the IFE. It is a very primitive system anyway with only a few channels on a cycle. Cabin service was woeful and finished up dehydrated because drinks only offered once. I have been Star Gold for all of the last 10 years. This was my first and will be last flight with TAP.,0
Salt Lake City to Portland. Arrived within the rescheduled time frame. Seat was already given away. Extremely disappointed. Will not recommend for future flights. Southwest personnel were not willing to recognize mistakes within notification system. Conscience of Southwest not worth the unconvincing of flight reschedule.,0
Flew MED to SGN and return in Business Class. Staff Service Food and Flight were excellent. We have flown Singapore Malaysian and Thai Business class prior to this and the whole experience with Vietnam Airlines was up there with them. We will definitely travel Vietnam Business Class again. Highly Recommended.,1
Horrible service. The only flight was delayed today. No timely intimation for delay. Staff at Jammu airport especially check in staff is unprofessional. Please don't for this airline.,0
Fort Lauderdale to Houston. This was our first time flying Spirit Airlines and it was absolutely a pleasant experience. The seats on the plane provided ample space and our flight attendants were absolutely amazing.  They were very nice and accommodating of any request we made. It seemed as though they truly enjoyed their jobs and serving others. We were so pleased with the service that we applied for the rewards Mastercard as we definitely plan on flying with Spirit Airlines again. We just hope we bump into these guys again. The level of customer service they provided definitely stood out.,1
"Singapore to Reunion via Mauritius. I've flown with Air Mauritius for more then 30 times but this was the worst experience. First there was no connecting flight from Singapore to Reunion, I was told to book a hotel in Mauritius and stay over night. Bad experience, the flight was delayed for 30mins, then an announcement was made that more information will be announced at 11am. My flight scheduled for 10am was cancelled but only at 1pm the announcement was made. How can one spend so much more money in Mauritius than the flight ticket itself.",0
Mumbai to Kolkata. Worst response I have faced from Spicejet. I have been trying to contact them for 4 days but no one picking up my phone. Every time it shows busy. In my case  i have booked my ticket for Kolkata for my unicef conference but owing to corona virus issue that conference has been cancelled. Because of that reason either i would like to reschedule my flight or cancel it. I have also put the request of rescheduling of my flight but no use.,0
"My daughter was flying from Rochester to Orlando for a cheer competition in Disney with her team and coach. When she arrived in Orlando she realized she had lost her wallet. I want to compliment the honesty, integrity, and helpfulness of the Southwest employees involved in getting the wallet returned in tact including the cash and gift cards that were inside. Her wallet ended up in Birmingham, Alabama where I was assisted by two extremely helpful staff. They were as extremely helpful in instructing me how to get the wallet mailed back and gave me the good news that the cash and gift cards were still inside. I don't know if a passenger found it and turned it in or if it was one of the crew that found it on the airplane. All I know is I am impressed how this scary experience for my daughter turned out so well because of the quick and honest actions of the Southwest employees. We fly Southwest frequently and will continue to because of the great customer service, affordable fares, and now, the amazing experience of a lost and found item! Thank you Southwest!",1
"Cancun to Veracruz. The airline does not let clients change their flight due to the pandemic of Coronavirus. This is a shame, no humanity. I would never take a flight with them, they only care about money. I had other airlines changing my flight with NO fees, such as InterJet or American Airlines.",0
"Ottawa to Newark via Toronto. Received an alert two days prior to the flight that due to weather flight would be delayed or cancelled and that I could rebook free of charge. They only gave options for the same day of the original flight. Thus, I booked after the storm would have passed. Less than 12 hrs before the rebooked flight Porter cancelled my flight and then rebooked me on a different flight that would have missed my connection, landing me back in NYC seven hours later than planned and with a layover of five hrs. Tried to call customer service only to be disconnected after hr and a half wait with no call back. Called back only for another hour expected wait time.  Ended up booking AirCanada same route, same time with zero hassle or delay.",0
"Becoming one of the worst airlines you could fly with, late to everything! We have flown Southwest for years now and they are more worried about getting the most amount of flight tickets bought and not about proper customer service.",0
"Flight from San Diego to San Jose was delayed only 15 minutes then given no notification by anyone until 15 minutes before our flight that it was delayed. No explanation, no help, no offer of a refund or trying to find us another flight. My husband and I can't miss our jobs early the next day. Customer service is absolutely horrendous at both bag check in and ticket counter. Will never fly Delta Air Lines again.",0
"March 14th from Beijing to Calgary. The flight was on time and it was a nice experience. Can't complain. Everything was smooth and delightful. The entertainment system was easy to use and with lot of selections. I took some other airlines before such as Air Canada, Air China, but Hainan Airlines is the best! Thanks for all the crew members. Highly recommended.",1
"Vancouver to Calgary. My son and I flew with Flair on July 31st returning August 3rd, 2018. Flair lost my sons car seat on the way to Calgary. Did not give us a car seat to use in Calgary. Had to find one ourselves to rent. No custom service line to call and no answer to emails. Got back to Vancouver expecting to find my car seat because the agent in Calgary said it was there. No Car seat! They gave me a booster seat. My son is 2 and a half. Legally can not seat in a car seat. They called me this week. They have found my car seat and I can now go and pick it up. But they can not guarantee that nothing happen to my car seat. It would be unsafe for me to use it. I have asked them to replace my car seat and I have had to answer. They will not pass the message on to the manager. Im not sure if a manager exists. Extremely poor custom service. Not with the cheap prices. Do not fly with Flair.",0
"Westjet cancelled our vacation on day of the flight during Christmas, AFTER we waited at the airport for four hours. They would not provide a refund and insist on giving us credit only, which expires in one year, and cannot be applied to taxes and fees. The credit includes the taxes and fees we paid for the original vacation. You cannot have it both ways.",0
Flight attendant was very rude while serving water and only bought this after a second reminder. I am very disappointed with the quality of service especially inflight where it was delayed more than an hour to take off. I certainly don't recommend this airline to anyone with,0
"Gold Coast to Manila via Singapore. Booked early to have it all sorted and quick flight. They changed the flight with 24hr stopover, then we can't change flight, so asked for money back. They will only give part back taking 300 dollars of our money now, they are doing it again for other flight.",0
"New York to Lisbon, returning Dublin to new York. The price, despite being in summer season, was excellent, especially in comparison to most other options. The level of service was the best we've experienced in many years of travel. It begins with the cockpit crew and attendants greeting passengers on entrance to and departure from the flights. They seemed more personable and enthusiastic than is common, and communicated pride and pleasure in their work. The food was surprisingly good and plentiful, free beverages were varied and frequent. We counted two passes with hot towels and four involving beverages. The entertainment options were fresh and divergent.Finally, we were forced to return due to a member of family's medical emergency. Delta could not have been more supportive and considerate related to this circumstance. Delta has announced in this past week, the upcoming utilization of a system involving in flight wifi free of charges will be initiated in the near future.",1
"The worst airline on planet earth. That changed the gates over 5 times from one side of the terminal to other, flight was delayed numerous times. Customer service non existent, in fact very rude. Business class was a ripoff. The worst experience by far. Never again.",0
"London to Shanghai via Helsinki. Considering the excellent cost, I thought Finnair Business class was fabulous. Condition of plane, quality of the staff, the lounges and the food, were all great. Admittedly, the entertainment system could be better. The bed was flat, but narrow with little lower leg room, but I slept a bit, and I reckon if you're really tired, so will you!",1
Horrible experience. I took four flights in one weekend to go to Colorado. Each one was over an hour delayed with barely any announcements or updates. Bad customer service and delays.,0
"Hong Kong to Berlin via Frankfurt. Very friendly staff at check in, flight good, the food and seat were good, transit good, and very friendly cabin crew. I slept 8 hours on this 12 hour flight to Frankfurt and felt good when I arrived. The thing I would personally like, if the seats in business class would have a bit more privacy.",1
"Worst experience. Flight delayed for 15 hours from Delhi to Chicago. Food is very bad in International flight. No Entertainment. Most of the screens are not working. Alcohol served is very low quality. Not clean and Most of remotes doesn't work , and those are old like 1947. Never travel Air India.",0
Bangkok to Chang Rai. Better than European low cost airlines. Good leg room and food provided on a short distance flight. Enough space for cabin baggage and friendly approach of the staff.,1
Flew from AGP to MAN no problem at all left early arriving 25 min ahead of schedule. Flight deck very informative during flight cabin crew very professional. Overall better experience than the flight out with Ryanair in what felt like a shoebox even thought booked extra legroom seat. Would always use Monarch.,1
"Dallas to Milwaukee. When we arrived at the gate, we were told that we had to check our bag. In fact, they did not let anyone in basic economy bring on their bag. Then when we boarded we found that there was plenty of overhead room. 2 minutes after boarding, I went to fetch my bag, with my bag tag in hand, and they refused to give me my bag it was right in front of me! I am outraged at their obstinance. I pack so that I never have to check my luggage because I loathe waiting to pick it up. I am a very dissatisfied customer.",0
This is the worst airline I have ever had the displeasure of being involved with. Not only do they charge your for any carry on bags but the in flight snack as well.  Worst customer service.  I will never fly with them again.,0
"Flight on April 22 2014 was delayed and then cancelled. After sitting and being told the takeoff was being delayed 3x they finally cancelled the flight. Announcing casually that it was cancelled and everyone needed to go to Customer Service. No warning. No ""We are really sorry."" No approaching the customer to help us out.",0
"Tokyo to Kuala Lumpur. MH89 from Tokyo to KL connecting to Singapore was delayed, once we arrived in Kuala Lumpur we only had 15 Mins to run and transfer to our connecting gate only to be told that our flight has been changed to midnight, there were so many things wrong with the airline.  There was no one waiting for us at the arrival gate to inform us about the transfer process and the staff at the transfer counter did not apologize and give attitude. The meal coupon is only 7 dollars!!!",0
"Absolutely appalling airline. Would definetly not recommend. Flew Rome to London Heathrow. Compared to the likes of Qatar, Emirates and Qantas they do not come close. I will never travel with British Airways again. Flights delayed from London to Rome by over 1hr, between 2 captains they could neither take off or land smoothly in perfect conditions. The food is shocking and over priced. The planes are out dated. There stewards and stewardesses are rude and unprofessional compared with the professionalism of other airline staff.",0
Flew Manchester to Sanford 19th July 2013 and returned 2nd August. Both flights were excellent departing on time good cabin crew and selection of films.,1
On return flight from Toronto to Vancouver both legs were 3 hours late due to 'the aircraft from the Caribbean flight being late'. Myself and other passengers inquired about the 'Champagne flight' as advertised but was told by the attendant that it only on the international flights that champagne is served. Well many of us were mistaken about that. I will not travel Sunwing again and I told them so but I don't think they care enough to respond.,0
"This was my first flight with Cubana Airlines and wasn't sure what to expect. I was pleasantly surprised at the flight and service. The plane to Holguin was a bit dirty and dated, but left a bit early and the leg and elbow room was great. Coming home we left about an hour late and never found out why. This plane seemed newer and cleaner. Both ways the cabin service was friendly and attentive. While other airlines are cutting service and staff, Cubana Airlines seemed like the old days.  A nice lunch was served and very good coffee. Also we were allowed 2 checked bags of up to 50lbs each and a 20lb carry on. The package price we got was a steal. I will fly Cubana Airlines again",1
"Budapest to Gatwick. Appalling, they charge you for normal sized hand baggage! We had to pay 25 euro at the gate. No other airline does this. They also charge you 60 euro for checking in at the airport. Absolutely shocking. Will never use again!",0
"A small gift provided on boarding the aircraft was a pleasant addition to the warm welcome for all the women travelling on IWD, a gesture which set the tone for a very pleasant return trip from Heathrow to Pavlodar. Each and everyone of the flight staff were friendly and helpful and very good representatives for the airline. There was more than ample space, I could stretch out on three seats and actually managed to sleep. The inflight entertainment was great and the safety notice really slick so I actually watched it in three languages. The catering and hospitality was super and I will look forward to flying with them once more.",1
"Nice to Barcelona. After waiting 3 hours in Nice, with no official delay announced anywhere and no employee knowing why we had to wait, we finally got into the plane but no take off. Thirty minutes later, the flight was cancelled and we all had to leave. We've only been told that some ""strikes were happening somewhere and people didn't want to work extra hours"". Only 10 seats available on the next flight, first arrived first served. I strongly don't recommend Vueling Airlines.",0
Chicago to Washington. Horrible experience! I had 2 small bags first customer service said it was ok. Went to board the plane they pulled me out of line called me a liar and then charged me double for a bag the size of my brief case. Will never fly again on this horrible airline that doesn't care about their customers.,0
We had a trip from Kochi to Ho chi Minh with 1 stop to Kuala Lumpur. Both of our flights were delayed. The first one for over 1 hour and the second for over 3 hours. The seats inside the aircraft are small. We ordered something to eat inflight and most things on the catalogue were missing and the food was very little for one person and the cabin staff didn't have enough change to give you back. I will not travel with this airline again for sure.,0
"I recently had the ""pleasure"" of flying with TAAG, the Angolan airline that makes you wonder if time actually exists. Seriously, their flights are so delayed that you could have time to write a novel or learn a new language while waiting for your plane to finally take off. And don't even get me started on their customer service. When my return flight was delayed by more than 7 hours, I knew I would miss my connecting flight in Luanda. But did TAAG care? Not one bit. They wouldn't refund my ticket even though I didn't even take the flight to Luanda because I knew I would be stranded there without a visa to enter the country. But hey, at least their ticket prices are high enough to make you think you're flying with a premium airline, right? Wrong. In fact, after flying with TAAG even Ryanair would feel like a premium airline. In all seriousness, if you're looking for an airline that doesn't value your time or money, then go ahead and fly with TAAG. Otherwise, save yourself the hassle and choose a different airline for your next trip.",0
"I flew with EVA Air during the summer and was a pretty pleasant experience. The staff behind the front desk were polite and helpful. The seats themselves feel bigger than your average premium economy. The inflight system had a great choice of Movies, music and games. The staff are really attentive, food was good too, there was a Taiwanese and Western option. Really well done. ",1
This is the worst experience I've had I understand it's New Years and its busy which is why I think they should be a little more organized. I will never fly Air Canada and would never recommend it. We came at 3 am to check in for our 6am flight yes we don't get served. Still waiting while they take the Toronto flight. We have been standing and still standing here to check in our luggage. They have no customer services. We have a big group with boxes and carts. We have been told to go in 3 different lines since 2 hrs ago yet still waiting. I would never fly this airline ever again.,0
"Mumbai to Bangalore. I had come to expect quality from Jet Airways, but had a really bad experience with this flight. It started with extremely long queues for baggage drop. Worst was that the flight was delayed by 2.5 hours, because of which all my further planning got completely thrown off schedule. Jet Airways service is veering towards pathetic.",0
"Saskatoon to Edmonton. Turned back to Saskatoon due to technical difficulties with the plane. Following a business call with employer, I was incredibly asked while inquiring about status of the delay, ""if I had been drinking"". What is this? The problem is not customer service, it's the choice of aircraft. I'll never intentionally fly Westjet again.",0
"Flew Sunwing Airlines on Feb 12 to the 19th from Ottawa to Santa Clara, Cuba. Elite plus, good leg room. Food was fine both ways breakfast sandwich on way down, smoked meat or cheese panini way back. Crew were very good, friendly, funny and helpful. Both flights on time, had no issues.",1
"My wife and I flew this route on May 1st to Singapore, and then Singapore to Christchurch on May 16th. Good flights, great crew, attentive, approachable, Meals great, drinks plentiful, alcoholic and juices, water, tea, coffee etc, A bit rough flying over Australia, captain had seat belt sign on several times, as well as announcements from cabin crew, Very safety conscience. Clean toilets, rubbish removed promptly. A great experience, would fly this top rating airline again.",1
Doncaster to Dalaman. We went on a flight to Turkey on Onur Air and I have to say the flight was like a Ryanair plane but Turkish. The plane has the worst leg room your could imagine. My farther had to stand up for the whole flight as the leg room was uncomfortable to sit in. The attitude of the crew was very bad as they were rude and looked like they had a sour face at the passengers. Although on the way back to Doncaster the crew were not as bad and were polite. The captain never said anything to the passengers like saying thank you for flying or coming out at the end of the flight to say in person. In conclusion I would not recommend this flight to anybody especially tall people!,0
"Completely unimpressed with British Airways. They lost my luggage on a  flight from Dublin to London. When I informed them, they did not apologise but assured me I would have my bag by that afternoon. I was lucky my air BnB provided me with a towel and toiletries. I had not heard from them by 6pm and was told to wait until they contacted me. I then got a message at 8pm at night to say they had found my bag and the courier was picking it up at 10pm and then it would be delivered. So I specifically stayed home that night And finally decided at midnight they were not going to deliver it so went to sleep. I woke up and called British Airways at 9am to ask when it was going to arrive and where was it as I got a message saying it was being picked up at 10pm the night before so had stayed home. They said to call the courier company. I then called the courier company and they said that it was a mistake and they would never deliver a bag that Late at night. They then said the driver had a late night so wouldn't arrive until lunch time that day. so I went out for the morning and returned to my apartment at lunch. I then received a message at lunch time that said they would actually not arrive until sometime between 3 and 5pm that afternoon. I called to see if I could get a more specific time or they could tell me when they were on the way. They said no, and that I would have to wait at my apartment for two hours and to call at 6pm if my bag had not arrived. This was ridiculous. I am so lucky my air BnB hosts supplied me with towels and a toothbrush and that I had money to go out and buy clothes for the day. So unimpressed with British Airways and their disorganisation with my bag.  I understand bags are lost but to be told that it was coming at three different times and also the fact that British Airways decided it had nothing to do with them anymore and to contact the courier company was a joke. They were the ones who lost the bag in the first place on a 50 minute flight with no transfers.",0
We have been at our destination now for 5 days and still have not received our bags. I have been calling for the last 5 days and have left numerous messages. No one has called back and no one answers the phone. You have to pay for everything and it seems no one has any manners in customer service. I will never fly spirit again in my life.,0
The flight got delayed for 2 hours without any reasons. Staff are very unorganized and rude. People are waiting in lines and the flight is not open. The price is as expensive as the other flight.,0
"I want to thank the staff from the Information desk in Istanbul Airport. I was flying to New York from Athens on 22 December 2016 and we had a transfer in Istanbul. Unfortunately I forgot my bag with all my money, ID and all the credits cards in the airplane we flew from Athens and I discovered this when we checked in to fly to New York. I was really shocked and fortunately I find staff in Information desk to help and return my bag with everything inside. Without their help I can't go on holiday and I didn't have any money to turn back to Athens. We was really lucky to find this amazing people who were running so quickly to get my bag and helps me to not miss the flight to New York. Turkish Airlines offers safe, great service and the airplane is new.",1
"They cancelled our flight without sending any notice, drove to airport for them to say flight cancelled no explanations. Really bad service, and have only refunded partial amount!",0
"I recently had a trip to Dubai on the 10th of July 2022, it was a Linking flight from Cameroon passing through Bangui to Nairobi Kenya then to Dubai. Honestly speaking it's my worst experience so far, it's been almost two weeks since I arrived Dubai but am yet to receive my luggage. Before leaving the airport on arrival I placed a complain with Dnata baggage services regarding my baggage and I was assured that I would get my luggage in less than 48 hours which have turn into two weeks have finished every penny I had on me for mobile top up and when I even call no 1 picks no get back to me, have sent emails and gotten no reply. Maybe next time you inform customers in advance that their luggage aren't safe or secured so they would know what to do with their luggage. Would never recommend this airline to anyone unless they wish to have a similar experience. what a waste of my money.",0
Naxos to Athens. Loved the ease that our luggage was checked weighed and checked in without any hassles. It is a small airport but the staff knew what they were doing as well as assisting passengers who were not sure of what to do. A very big thank you and I will definitely flying with you again next summer.,1
"BA is still charging premium airlines fares however delivering nothing better than what a low cost offers. Seat does not recline, legroom is minimal causing anyone taller than 1.60m a torture to fly as being in a sardine can. Good old times of being a glamour flying BA has far gone. Ground force almost reduced to 0, only a very cheap pack of crispy and water. The only positive side is the cabin crew always there for you and happy, or well pretending at least. For the price they charge I advise every passenger to fly any other low cost airline as an alternative. You pay extra for absolutely nothing.",0
"Santiago to Buenos Aires. Excellent. No problems at all. Will fly again. Great staff at both airport and plane crew, clean aircraft, comfortable seat for economy class flight departed on schedule and arrived 10 minutes before.",1
"Prague to Madrid. Everything about Ryanair is bad. Bad support staff at the airport. No information on that you have to pay additional at the airport for the ticket. Rude staff, not at all seamless.",0
"Liverpool to Dublin with Aer Lingus. Can't express enough my thanks and appreciation for making my first ever flight such a wonderful experience. The cabin crew were excellent and once they found out it was my first flight at the age of 71, they went out of their way to offer me reassurance. They even offered me a local newspaper and provided me with a glass of proseco. I would highly recommend the cabin crew and Aer Lingus for their professionalism and making my journey pleasurable.",1
"Bangkok Don Mueang to Osaka with AirAsiaX. Delay after constant delay. Even boarding the plane is delayed by half an hour. The motto of this company should be ""never on time"". Horrible experience, not even counting the nickle and diming.",0
"Vienna to Lusaka via Addis Ababa, Worst travel experience. Firstly got bumped off my connection flight to Lusaka from Addis apparently the flight was overbooked. This happened just before boarding and staff were extremely unhelpful and gave conflicting statements. Waited about 4 hours after missing the flight to be given an alternative flight for the following day. Was then informed that my bags had already left and I would find them in Lusaka. When I finally got to Lusaka my bags were not there! No explanation provided.",0
London to Hong Kong. Lucky enough to win a Virgin Online Bid for Upper Class on outward Leg. Outbound was excellent in all areas. Lounge at Heathrow amazing and flight and facilities brilliant. Returned on Economy with Extra Leg Room and was never going to be as good but was ok. Leg Room good and cabin crew and food very good.,1
"Edinburgh to Miami via Dublin. Had our tickets changed twice at short notice ending up with a whole day sitting in Dublin Airport with young children. No apology, just get on with it. Try emailing guest relations which is a joke as they are simply not bothered, I presume due to the extremely high number of complaints. Yes its cheap but without a doubt at a high price when it comes to service.",0
"London to Addis Ababa on Ethiopian Airlines A350. Their 787 and 777s are great too but the A350 is quicker. I have used it twice to Addis this year, January it was only 6 hrs 30 mins flying time, this time 6 hrs 45 minutes. Have flown London to Addis many times on BMI. KLM, Luthansa, Emirates and the old East African Airways in the 70s. Ethiopian Airlines current service and the A350 beats them all. Even LHR Terminal 2, of which I am not fond, was smooth this time with very helpful staff at bag drop. This overnight flight to Addis is at 9pm in UK summer and 8.00pm UK winter. We rolled back in an almost full plane at 9.30 pm. The dinner served about 11 pm was great, on the box it said chicken curry but it was a lovely chicken tika masala and other items on the tray were also excellent. They serve Habesha, one of several excellent Ethiopian lagers but unfortunately do not yet do Ethiopia's first class Rift Valley wines. Arrived Addis 06.30 and visas on arrival was also extremely efficient and quick despite a queue of around 30 people. I fly London to Addis return on average three times a year and right now would not consider any other airline for it. In the past 2 years have also flown Addis Bangkok return, Addis to Capetown, Joburg to Addis. All excellent flights with no problems. Be aware that Ethiopian Airlines satisfied customers do not mostly write on here.",1
"Most convenient connection between the two cities.As I needed to go from Bydgoszcz to Warsaw in certain time frame I found this connection to be more convenient than railway as it was way shorter but only small bit more expensive but for time concious people like me it was best connection between two towns. As Bydgoszcz is a small airport we boarded by stairs and had to walk only a small bit to the aircraft but weather was not bad so it was not an issue, again as on every LOT flight as we enter we get a sanitizing wipes, which was good. The flight was very short under 40 mins the cabin crew did a very good job providing complimentary pastry and cup of water. In my opinion one of the best LOT domestic connection as it was relatively cheap and the good service despite very short flight but makes it very fast journey between cities, would highly recommend anyone traveling between Bydgoszcz and Warsaw to consider this connection.",1
"Had to fly to Honolulu for a business trip and usually have to layover in Dallas. Since I had an early morning flight, the first leg of the journey was fine. The second leg of the journey was not as bad as previous experiences with American but the service was deplorable.  The flight attendants don't seem to care about  providing a sufficient level of service for those of us paying for their benefits. During the 7 hour flight from Dallas to Honolulu, the flight attendants walk the aisles maybe 3 times. If they pass you the first time, you will just have to wait until the second round.",0
"Inconsistent, rude staff at the counter in San Jose Costa Rica who told me I could not take the flight because I don't have vaccine to access Spain. I had to stop there because my final destination was Dubai and it is not necessary to have vaccine just to transit through Spain. Dubai is open for tourist or residents and is not necessary to be vaccinated. After some time of having a hard time with this guy at the counter who was ""saying is the supervisor"", because i showed my Dubai Visa on my passport he was taking me into consideration to get to the flight after he made a call saying yes, she will fly because she has Dubai Visa, but he did not let me travel with my suitcase when i was just in transit in Spain.",0
Eugene to Jacksonville. Delta has pushed my luggage to a different aircraft 3 different times one one of my luggage and 4 with another. I finally received one. But the other still says it's in transit on a flight that was supposed to land almost 6 hours ago. No one will answer a call either to to answer any questions or help me try and find my luggage audit determine where it might be at.,0
Whatever you do do not subscribe to the Al Jazeera Airways newsletter. It is impossible to unsubscribe. I would not travel with an airline that cannot comply with standard legislation around the word on email marketing.,0
"I took my family on vacation to Punta Cana in the Dominican Republic. Flying via Paris to Punta Cana. The flight from Paris to Punta Cana was really dissapointing. The overall quality and comfort has decreased. The plane seems to be worn down. The Entertaiment system was not up to date and malfunctioned a number of times. On long haul flights you will normally have a drink served before the meal, but here was no drinks. There was no choice of meals. On the return flight to Paris overnight they served a breakfast meal, but it was really minimal. Three slices of fruit, a tiny roll and a piece of cake. The comfort of the seats were bad. The absolut minimum seat pitch. It is the last we are flying long haul with Air France.",0
Glasgow to Luton. I would like to say a special thank you to cabin crew Lisa who was unbelievably helpful during our flight back home. I get terrible anxiety when flying and was having a hard time calming down. Lisa went above and beyond to reassure me and help me get through the flight and even allowed myself and my husband to move closer to the front of the aircraft to ease the motion sickness. Hats off to the pilot for flying so well in windy weather. Would definitely recommend easyjet to friends and family.,1
"Barcelona to Vienna. The plane was very comfortable, and thankfully we had a great flight round trip. The Crew on the other hand were horrific. Languages, although the flight was from Barcelona they did not speak Spanish. My friend made the mistake of speaking to the stewardess in Spanish, and she got scolded to speak English! Since my friend didn't speak English, and it is my first language I translated for her. The stewardess that demanded to be spoken to in English had a below average level of it.  I would recommend they improve their English, or find new employees. The same stewardess started moving and arranging bags and coats without letting the owner of the things she was moving were she was moving it to. When we arrived in Vienna people were looking for their belongings. On our way back, I asked a stewardess if she could put my coat in the overhead bin after everyone was on the plane since I was sitting on a window seat, and didn't want to take up space. She grabbed my folded coat, than stuffed it like a rag in the overhead, The same stewardess sold me a chocolate croissant and made me get it warm or she wouldn't sell it to me. When I got it after paying 2.50 euros, it tasted like a soggy piece of bread with chocolate.",0
"Islamabad to Melbourne via Abu Dhabi. Not very good experience for long flight economy class passenger. Very small aircraft for long flight of more than 13 hours, over packed flight. Abu Dhabi airport very disappointing in terms of longer transit, pathetic duty free. Food on flight was below average. However flight crew was active and kind. Have travelled from Islamabad to Melbourne then back from Sydney to Islamabad. Although from Sydney it was A380,but again overbooked flight! Economy class not very comfortable. Will never fly with Etihad again, very small aircraft, poor food, no free internet on flight and unimpressive duty free!",0
"I flew China Southern Airlines from Hohhot City to Guangzhou.  As that was international Mother's Day, the crew prepared presents for mothers on the flight. After meal service, my wife was chosen to be the lucky one, my son and my wife received delicate gifts. As a special memory to keep, the crew agreed me to take some photos. We really appreciate their service and surprise for us. ",1
"United Airlines allows their customers to be trapped at customs baggage claims for more than two and half hours with minimal information. We were told that it simply would take longer due to weather twice in that entire time. No information about missing flights was given. Due to the nature of customs people are told to not get in their bags or be on their phones. It also means we are without access to any food you may have packed. Unless it was less than 3.4 ounces, we have no access to drinks. If you want to not feel like a trapped animal, pick any other airline.",0
"Very pleasant Flight Auckland to Munich via Dubai with Emirates, Cabin Crew was friendly and the food fantastic. Every one of my 5 Flights was on time and the aircraft was not too crowded. The plane was clean and the Inflight entertainment has good a very good and wide selection of movies. All in all I would definitly fly again with them.",1
"Travelled to Ercan on 6th Oct. After reading the reviews I was very nervous about travelling with this airline but had no choice in the matter as it was a package holiday booked through Cyprus Paradise. The flight out was fine we left on time and arrived on time no problems there apart from the cramped legroom space but to be honest it wasn't any worse than EasyJet or Pegasus. The crew were a different matter a more surly indifferent bunch you could not wish to meet. One of the toilets was a problem and smelt absolutely awful especially for those sitting near to it. Nothing was done about it until we reached Antalya and the cabin crew changed over then some air fresher was finally sprayed about. The return trip left on time and all seemed to go well until leaving Antalya when the pilot informed us that we were now going to divert to another airport before going onto Stansted for ""operational reasons"". Fortunately it was not too long a wait on the ground and we arrived at Stansted just 2 hrs late. As a nervous flyer taking off and landing 3 times was a bit stressful but I have to say the cabin crew on this flight were a lot nicer and approachable. Would I travel with this airline again? No I think I would avoid it at all costs.",0
"Orlando to Amsterdam via Reykjavik. Like many people here, we booked several months in advanced and our flight got cancelled few weeks before departure. Without any reason. Wow Air offered an alternative flying two weeks later or fly from New York rather than Orlando. Both weren't realistic and the customer services agent agreed. We had our hotels, rental car, events, etc. already booked. Since it was in the beginning of January, it cost us an additional 600 euro to fly home with another airline. Hours later than we originally planned.",0
Larnaca to Budapest. Our cabin bags were checked by WizzAir staff on checkin as well as check in bags. They confirmed our cabin bags were suitable weight and size. When we're about to board they told us they weren't suitable and had to pay 60 Euro cash or we couldn't board. Emailed WizzAir to complain and they take an unacceptable amount of time to respond. By packing so many people into the plane the legroom is uncomfortable and there isn't enough space for each persons cabin luggage to go into the overhead compartment. Works out 5 bags for each 9 seats. A cheap flight ends up being expensive when you add in the bags for checkin and the payment charges as well as the booking charges. Save your money and go a proper airline.,0
Would avoid using this airline again. Bristol to Dalaman flight OK plenty of leg room with no extra charge however Dalaman to Bristol was a nightmare  flight was put forward to 3 o'clock instead of 5'clock and whilst checking in the board said Bristol and Newcastle so we had to ask what was going on. Without any notice we had to fly to Newcastle and then to Bristol which extended our flying time to 6 hours. I think this is appalling considering they didn't give us any free refreshments or an apology! You get what you pay for.,0
"Toronto to London sleeper service means you can have a buffet dinner in the lounge rather than onboard the plane to maximise rest time. Excellent flight, LHR fast track system allowed for speedy connection onto my flight to Berlin. Heathrow to Berlin a pleasant flight with excellent service. The negative issue is that British Airways business class seat selection costs extra if done in advance.",1
I really was disappointed. Leaving Milwaukee no flight crew. One and a half hours late leaving stand in line for two hours to get connecting flight changed airplane waiting for me to board. This was leaving Milwaukee for Houston. Coming home leave Florida great. Get to Chicago no crew finally board plane wrong crew and asked us to get off the plane. Wait for right crew to get there held up in Milwaukee. Get on plane 1.5 hours late taxi back to terminal plane over heating. Get this fixed so we have no air conditioning in plane sweat and over heat to go to Milwaukee. What is the problem. Don't think I ever want to fly United again if this is the normal procedure.,0
"The flight attendant woke me up 4 hours into the flight to tell me I didn't have the right mask and I have to wear a different one, she gave me one then came back every 10 minutes to check on my and give me hassle about not wearing it properly and I can't eat or drink and I get a final warning. I had earbuds in and didn't hear what she said till the ""final warning"" never use this airline.",0
This was my first time and will be my last time to ever fly on this airline because the seats are uncomfortable and my butt was feeling sore when I was sitting on the seat. The only positive thing about that is that there was a flight attendant that told me that she liked my shirt that I was wearing that was nice.,0
"Denver to Washington. Great airline, their flight attendants were friendly, service was fast, beautiful airplane, clean, and not run down. Great disability service.",1
"Cape Town to Durban. But from the get go upon checking in how awful of me with the pain I was already in, the attendant that assisted me in CT International was the best, like a godsend at that time of morning and his willingness to assist me and make my check in such a breeze. Also inflight, the cabin crew were the best, i also had the best tasting cappuccino. Extremely helpful and courteous staff. Our flight arrived 20mins ahead of schedule. Now that for me was the cherry on top. To Flysafair crew and ground team thank you so much for the best experience especially with having to have had to fly with my medical condition.",1
Flight canceled and require to book other airline by paying double charge. Never book Go First flight as they canceled their without any reason. It's worst and third class flight.,0
I accidentally booked the wrong flight. Alaska was able to switch me from a Sunday return to a Monday return on short notice. Great customer service and helpful support. Recommend to everyone.,1
"East Midlands to Arrecife, EMA check in staff very helpful. Flight left on time and arrived early, staff onboard helpful and pleasant, good information from flight deck. Plenty of leg room but seats tend to be on the hard side, but alright for up to four hours duration. Food of good quality. Return departure delayed three hours because of French Air traffic Controllers. Onboard the Captain gave a full explanation of the delay. Cabin crew again very helpful and pleasant and food was of a good standard, arrived into EMA fifteen minutes early.",1
"Ho Chi Minh to Hanoi. 3 hours delay, no information given. The Flyone crews operated the flight, no greeting, no smiling, not allowing us to use bathroom during waiting for last minute passengers. We highly recommend that fellow travelers avoid this airline.",0
"My partner and I booked a flight with Sun Country last year. The flight had to be cancelled a couple months later due to COVID. Sun Country told us that, because of the pandemic, they couldn't offer us a refund and would have to give us a flight credit instead. We were not told about an expiration date, and were not given any extra confirmation or verification for this credit. I called customer service recently to look up my credit, and it had supposedly expired a month prior. I was told there was nothing I could do about this. Sun Country took our money, cancelled our flight, refused to give a refund, and is now refusing to let us reschedule. Reading other reviews, I see I am not the only one having this experience. Sun Country needs to make this right.",0
"I booked a flight on 23 October 2020 however, I did not get a confirmation email so I called to find out why that was so. I called the first time but I ran out of airtime after waiting for 11 minutes. I called the second time and this one guy asked for my email and assured me that he would send the booking confirmation but that did not happen. I had to call again and was asked to email my bank statement because apparently I had not paid, mind you, my account had been debited! I checked my flight status after a week but it still said ""Not paid""! So I emailed to find out what was happening but they never replied. Had to call again, not once, twice but three times! You have to literally wait 11 minutes or more for an agent to take your call, it is frustrating really! I would not in my wildest dreams recommend this airline to anybody. Yes, they have cheap flights but you will go through hell, I promise you. Their customer service is beyond poor! This was my first time flying with Mango and it certainly is the last!",0
Venice to Stansted. Absolutely would not recommend. 5 hour delay on the flight and the most unhelpful staff. Didn't even bring us food throughout our entire wait when we were held in the flight for 3 hours. Didn't reimburse us because the held us in the flight not the terminal.,0
I was a little surprised to read the negative reviews of Alaska. I have always flown them and almost always satisfied and comfortable. Most recently I went Juneau to Kona and back with no complaints. I have found them better than other American carriers I have flown. Also of note due to flying in bad weather in Alaska most of their planes have cutting edge navigation technology in the cockpits.,1
"Both my routes had long delays, and I am talking about 5 hour and 6 hour delays. There is no consideration for the people who want to fly to their destination. And on top of that the people in charge are rude and very defensive",0
A most uncomfortable experience. Flew from Maui to Sky Harbor Phoenix. The crew cabin crew were inattentive and disinterested. For a five and a half hour flight thru the night they had one beverage run. Did not return after some 4 hours to offer even water. We traveled with two 13 year old granddaughters who were in a different part of the cabin. My wife attempted to alert a flight attendant that they were alone and to let us know if the needed anything and was bruskly brushed off. There was no announcement about the impending landing until the last moment. There was overall a very uncaring attitude which make me feel like a worthless commodity. I am an experienced traveler but this stands out as the worst flight I have experienced.,0
Airport staff is not trained well. Everyone was giving me the different information. Do not know what is the next step. Taking hours for work should be done within minutes. Took double the amount of fee for one baggage. Trying to contact customer service and agents are saying they cannot do anything and I should speak to Delhi airport wow is that even possible. What are they working for?,0
Premium economy Manchester to Dominican Republic return. On both flights we found cabin staff very friendly and helpful. Inflight entertainment provided was excellent. Comfort was good seats comfy and plenty of legroom. The pamper packs provided proved to be most useful. Inflight meals of the highest standard and drinks service regular. All in all a very enjoyable experience and can't wait to fly Thomson premium again!,1
"Was disappointed to learn that Qatar Airways was partnering with American Airlines since previous experience with American Airlines was mediocre. But my return trip turned horrendous with the worst customer service possible at my SFO connection. Qatar was delayed, so I missed my connection but the worst part was American Airlines customer service. Although mid afternoon she began by saying to take my big bag and come back in the morning. When I began to explain my situation, she angrily said ""I do not want to talk to you! I reminded her that Qatar was their partner and her service would prevent customers from using American Airlines in the future, and she snapped ""I don't care!"" Never again will I fly on American Airlines. It's customer service is horrible.",0
"Our flight was suppose to leave London Ontario, flight WS 3504 at 0700 on July 5th to fly to Toronto. Then home to Thunderbay the same day. The Toronto to thunderbay flight was still ago. But when we went online to present board our flight from London to Toronto was cancelled. They didn't notify us earlier of the cancellation. Therefore we could not make alternate arrangements. When we talked to an agent she said we will not be compensated for this error on their behalf. They said we could fly out 4 days later which is un acceptable. Never again would I fly with them.",0
"Dubai to Melbourne via Singapore, and a fantastic flight. The flights departed on time, the cabin crew were polite, and the IFE was up to date with the latest box office movies. I have noticed an improvement in the Singapore Airlines inflight meals, which was a welcome surprise.",1
"Sucre to La Paz. Only one hour flight but gave us a nice chicken sandwich and when asked for more they kindly gave me as much as I wanted. Staff was friendly, aircraft on time and checking happened quick in sucre, although not so high tech. Plane was a Boeing, looked well maintained.",1
"Dhaka to Singapore. They have the worst possible online support staff. Standard of food, cabin crew or cleaning in the aircraft were terrible. AC inside the aircraft did not work properly.",0
"I have flown 3 return trips with this airline this month. One trip was a business meeting in Jakarta, my 8am outbound was moved to 10amwhilst I was in the air the return was brought forward 2hrs from 16.30 to 14.30. Terrible customer service. When I tried to bring flight 6 forward to return early they attempted to charge me full price to downgrade from business to economy.",0
I had a direct flight from Adelaide to KUL with Malaysian airline. For checkin the staff had a rude and impolite behavior with us.  When I was in Malaysia I saw that all cabin crew and staff were very nice and friendly. But in Adelaide the staff that did the check in was very impolite and she also fined me more than 2 hundred AUD without any reasonable reason. She knew that we are in rash so she did not care our request and she just want to fined us. I think a bad behavior from a staff can affect the popularity of an airline and I have never forgotten this behavior.,0
This airline is the biggest scam ever. Terrible customer service. Well actually no customer service. Flight was delayed and we were not informed by email nor text. It was not even on the app! The app stated it was on time. They charge for any little thing. You end up paying the same if not more as other airlines. There is also no customer service number. I will never fly Frontier again. First and last time I will make that mistake!,0
"I flew China Southern Airline with my family from Harbin  to Adelaide via Guangzhou. It was very pleasant experience, the ground staff were very helpful and friendly. Cabin crew were very efficient and friendly. Inflight meals  tasty especially from Guangzhou to Adelaide. Seats onboard were comfy. Overall, I was very happy with China Southern Airline and services were getting better and better.",1
"By far one of the worst airlines I have taken so far. First, it took so long to check in my baggage. The line was long and a lot of passengers brought overweight baggage. Most passengers do not want to pay extra for the excess baggage so they had to rearrange the baggage. Why don't these passengers do this before checking in? Ground service staff showed patience to me. On the flight, I was dissatisfied with the seat and in flight food. I tried to get some rest on this 8 hour flight but these tight seats were punishing me. The food was  bland and pathetic. I had a few bites and did not finish the whole meal. The flight attendants were attentive, yet I can only give a pass on their service.",0
Flew American Airlines from Miami to Atlanta. When boarding the plane the lady checking my bag said she wanted me to check and see if it would fit and if not I would have to check it. I was able to fit it in and she rudely told me I still had to check it even after me telling her I was going to miss my shuttle from Atlanta to Chattanooga. I also told her I was pregnant and really needed to make the shuttle. I had no trouble on the way there and didn't purchase anything this trip so the bag size did not change. Customer service was absolutely horrible. I've never felt so disrespected while traveling. No wonder they have had such horrible reviews lately. They need to work on their employee training so that customers are treated with respect.,0
"Milan to Montreal via Paris with Air France. Rapid access to the airplane and very fast lanes. In the plane the food wasn't that good, but was okay. The seats were comfortable and the cabin staff is very good. You have a very large collection of films in a lot of languages. The plane wasn't very clean. I think Air France is a good airline, and it is certainly better than Alitalia.",1
"Purchasing experience was good. Then ce check in time. Checking in from Edmonton to Vancouver was ok, had to try a few times on the app to get it through. Plane was ok. Tight seats and expensive snacks. The real headache was the online check in from Vancouver to Edmonton. Tried several times with no success. Tells me my seats are in two very different rows when my purchase agreement shows I paid for seats 5e and 5f. Can't contact anyone via chat. Can't contact anyone on the phone. Horrible Custer service. Will never fly with them again.",0
"Vancouver to Gatwick and the aircraft is cramped. When the seat in front reclines you are jammed into the seat with very little room to move.  The food beggers belief, portions are fit for a 5 year old and the salad was frozen! They only serve 1 meal  and a slice of banana bread during the 9.5 hour flight. The price paid was extortionate for what we got. The entertainment could really do with an upgrade. In the middle of January they were still playing Christmas movies. Choice is very limited and in music there really is no choice. Very disappointed and won't waste my money on them again.",0
"Worst airways ever, after booked I called them they said don't need PCR test for Dhaka to London. So I went for check in,  gave them my vaccine certificate and locator form but they refused me check in for a PCR test. Tried to call customer service but they were closed that time. Later contacted them by phone and email,  sent them all proof but now they saying I went there without a vaccine certificate and locator form which is not true. I had a print copy and digital copy too.",0
"Flew with Thomson purely because I had to as it was part of the holiday package from Birmingham to Tenerife, would not select them out of choice. Aircraft dirty both ways, tray tables especially poor with food residue from previous flights. Crew very varied some very pleasant and smart but others look very miserable, scruffy and unkept. One crew member thought it was funny to make faces behind an elderly passengers back because they didn't know where to store their baggage, so childish and unprofessional. Inflight service painfully slow both ways and crew only started serving drinks an hour into the flight. Make sure you take your own food as there is only over priced rubbish to buy which looked greasy and rubbery on my neighbours tray table. Whole flight seem very disorganised compared to Easyjet or Jet2, Thomson crew seem very disorganised and just want to rush everything to hide away in the galley. They only seem to have a passion for shutting the curtain so they can't see their passengers. One toilet in the forward of the plane was sealed off for ""crew use only"" never seen this before and caused long queues. Would personally avoid Thomson in the future as the flights are more of an ordeal than an experience. Thomson resort staff are wonderful however polite and efficient. Wherever possible would prefer to use Easyjet as they are always consistent and the crew are always polite, smart and organised. Avoid Thomson and don't forget your anti bacterial gel as the planes are filthy.",0
"If you want to have a smooth travel do not travel with American Airlines. Each of my flights were 2hr delayed, lost my luggage, terrible customer service. They lost me as a customer.",0
"Orlando to Chicago. This is positively the worst airline I've ever flown, and I've travelled all over the world. No customer service to speak of, rude attendants, questionable safety practices, just bad all around. They now fly in and out of the International terminal in Chicago, a ""small fact"" they neglect to inform you about until you find you are in the wrong place and cannot easily get to your destination in time. I can't say enough bad things about Frontier Airlines. I'm surprised the FAA allows them to operate like this.",0
"New York JFK to Dublin return. We always enjoyed flying Aer Lingus to Dublin almost once a year, and went out of our way to book it. We paid an extra USD240 round trip to get extra leg room. They had reconfigured the seating and I could not straighten my legs out and the seats were narrower. The cabin crew was rude and sounded like a bunch of teenagers when hanging out in the galley after lights went out. I complained to Aer Lingus on 16 October and received a confirmation number. I have not heard anything since. Next year's trip will not be booked on Aer Lingus.",0
"Chicago to Cebu via Shanghai. I had knee replacement 13 weeks prior to this trip so I ordered and paid extra money for bulkhead seats. Upon arrival in China my knee was sore and swollen so I asked for a wheelchair. I was promptly told no, you don't need a wheelchair. On the return flight we did not get the bulkhead seats I paid for. I asked for an upgrade or a refund for the last leg of the flight. I was told the plane is full and that to get a refund I need to call this number. I took pictures on the plane of 12 empty business class seats. I called the number and gave them the confirmation receipt and was I ordered the upgrade too long ago and their is nothing they can do now. They are rude, unprofessional and liars.",0
HKIA to Chiang Mai in Thailand in tourist class. Service was excellent staff spoke excellent English and mandarin Chinese. Though the flight was short food was delicious both ways much better that transatlantic flights to South America in Iberia business class. I sat in the front rows seats were quite spacious and leg room was abundant being 1.88 tall I could appreciate the difference with other airlines. I will definitely fly again Dragonair for short medium flights in south east Asia. Ticket was not cheap compared to European flights or Air Asia. But it was not expensive either if compared to similar length flights in the region.,1
"East Midlands to Dublin. We had no expectations, but what a great surprise! It's a simple airline and you get what you pay for. Please don't expect a luxury first class for a little money. It's a company that transports you from point A to point B and that's it. They fares and fees are simple and very clear. I think some people are just ignorant and they don't read what is included in the flight ticket and expect luxury travel for cheap. Want more comfort? Pay for it, it's so simple. Our flight from EMA to DUB and return flight from DUB to EMA was on time, very simple and crew on board friendly. We paid a little more for priority boarding for both flights for two people and we are still alive for that a little fee. Brilliant airline for cheap travel across Europe!",1
"The direct flight was changed to one stop flight and no apologies no food for kids, and after that baggage were not even handled property. The baggages were Made to recheck in at Kochi and missed because of belt issues. 3 days and still counting, there is no info on where the bags are. These kind of airlines should be shut down completely.",0
Flew Beijing direct to JFK. A 13.5 hour flight with 2 terrible meals no personal television screens and just a few screens dotted around. Unfortunately Air China use videotapes to show films and so the picture was crackly. Very little room and a most uncomfortable experience. Additionally flight attendants spend most of the flight behind a curtain trying to get some sleep. On the return flight there was a 4 hour delay. No apology or explanation. On our arrival in Beijing we were kept waiting for 1.5 hours for our baggage while employees were standing around laughing and joking amongst themselves.,0
"An extraordinary trip from Istanbul to Casablanca with the Royal Air Maroc, a very professional staff and the cabin well equipped with all amenities to make you forget the 5 hours of travel.",1
"Flights are never on time and they take no accountability for their mistakes. In January I got stuck in Charlotte for 24 hours. They wouldn't pay for the hotel. And right now, I am sitting on a plane delayed of course. But there is no pilot for this plane. A nice gentleman got on the intercom and informed us that they ""think we have a pilot"" but aren't sure. And will ""update us as soon as he figures out whats going on."" I'm about to miss my connecting flight in Charlotte again because of their incompetence. Worst airline, and one of the worst company's ever. Zero regard for their paying customers, it borders on consumer abuse.",0
We are currently onboard Spirit Flight 710 that landed at LaGuardia airport on time on Sunday October 19. Upon arrival the pilot announced that another aircraft was loading passengers at our gate and we would be at the gate within 15 minutes. It is now over an hour later and we are still not at our gate no further announcements. The pilot has announced that the FAA is completing the log book and the flight attendants should provide us complimentary snacks and drinks. Only one gate for this flight and no plan B is on of their continued problem and the lack of customer service is another major issues. Any consideration for sending a bus and have us deplane? The plane is freezing cold! We were doing fine until we finally landed and after not flying Spirit for a while owing to the poor and consistently horrific customer service my return has been met with another horror ending. Spirit do us a favour and do not expand until you improve your existing services.,0
"They don't serve bottled waters on the plane. I took Cathay years ago and the service was exceptional, legroom was great. Now if you are on economy, the legroom is tiny. They squeeze an unhealthy amount of people on the plane and expect people to check their carry on as they have now run out of space. My tray table was not clean and their crew looked exhausted. They did not respond to the call bell throughout the flight. Pillows and blankets were provided upon request.",0
Malta to Frankfurt. I called Lufthansa Malta customer care 8 times and no one wants to take the phone call. The generic Lufthansa email is not accepting any more emails. A process where the company decides to cancel the booking then I believe that an email informing about a refund is received rather than trying to call them myself multiple times and no email contact.,0
"Absolutely horrible! I received a credit for a cancelled flight that I attempted to use to fly my son out for his military leave during Christmas. American Airlines wouldn't let me use the credit due to the fact that his name wasn't on the original ticket. It shouldn't matter who is on the original ticket, it shouldn't matter who paid for the ticket. I will never fly American Airlines again!",0
I booked my Delta Air Lines flight in July for myself and my three children. I was just informed that it wasn't possible to book our seats together. Why in the world would I want my three young children to sit separately from me next to people I don't know. When I booked for one adult and three children it should be clear that they will need to sit by their parent. My gosh! One son is slated about 20 rows ahead of the remaining three of us.,0
Flew from Gatwick to Sharm el Sheikh in August. Outbound flight 4.45 hrs very cramped no in flight entertainment expensive drinks pilot kept us informed. Return flight was 5 hours 20 mins very hot lack of in flight entertainment really let's Thomson down on longer flights very cramped seats. Plus side both flights took off on time and cabin crew were good.,0
Bag accidently routed to the wrong destination. Problem was handled professionally and promptly! Delivered to my home the next day with everything intact. All good. Great to have an airline service small cities. Staff very friendly and very smooth flight!,1
"Shenzhen to Moscow.The economy class on this flight was very full, however the crew were friendly and professional. Because there is no inflight entertainment onboard they provide portable electronics. I will be very happy to take China Southern Airlines again in future.",1
Short flight Shanghai to Narita. Very well done. 777 Business Elite has an odd layout can't see out window even in window seat without craning neck. Other than that comfortable nice breakfast and excellent professional crew. Bring that style to domestic flights and Delta will succeed.,1
"Flew Lufthansa from Frankfurt to Prague. The aircraft was a slightly older machine, but in good condition. The departure and the arrival were on time. The aircraft was in a clean state and the flight attendants were extremely friendly. The small board catering and the drinks according to the circumstances. Overall, a good experience.",1
Flying from Faro last Saturday we are caught up in the flight control situation. Our Captain was excellent he stood just outside the flight deck and explained exactly the situation and our options he was calm lucid and just about as helpful as it was possible to be. 3 times during our delay he broadcast updates so that we knew what was going on. The cabin crew did everything possible to keep all of us comfortable. Overall a brilliant customer service experience.,1
Frontier Airlines is the worst airline I have ever had to deal with. After we booked our flight they changed the first flight so we had to rearrange our work event to accommodate and then they changed our flight home from a direct flight to a flight that left at 1 AM and arrived in Denver at 4AM with a connecting flight to Seattle. We are trying to cancel our return flight booking. What a mess.,0
"I just returned August 3, 2015 on Allegiant Air where I experienced a 22 hour delay due to mechanical issues. Our flight was supposed to leave Kalispell at 9pm on Sunday, August 2nd. We were told that the plane was delayed so we sat in the airport and waited. We were finally told after 2 hours that the flight was cancelled and we would have to get a hotel for the night. We were instructed to come back to the airport in the morning. This was a joke because they had to fly in the part they needed to fix the plane. We finally arrived at our hotel at 1 am and then returned to the airport at 8 am. We had to wait for Allegiant staff to arrive at the airport. By 11 am we were informed that the flight was again delayed until 6 pm. The staff were unapologetic about the entire situation. We finally departed at 7pm, 22 hours after our original departure time. ",0
"Melbourne to Adelaide. My partner and I were running late due to standard Melbourne roadworks and traffic, yet the Virgin Australia team were seamlessly able to get our bags checked in and get us through to our gate in time. This is the best experience I have had with an airline and am confident in choosing Virgin as my preferred airline in the future. Thanks to the Melbourne team for being awesome and we hope to fly with you again soon!",1
Worst airline. All connections missed because of their incompetence. I will never fly AA again. I would rather not travel than be on this airline. Ruined going and coming back on my vacation. Truly unreal how bad they are. Pay more if you must.,0
Flew from Pakse to Luang Prabang in February 2013. Flight was on time with a snack provided. Friendly FAs and spotless cabin on an ATR72. Interesting mountain views as we approached L.P. Small but service superior to that of major airlines. Flying used to be like this.,1
Flew from Austin to New York. This is the third time I have had problems with American Airlines. I am done giving them chances. They are constantly delaying and canceling flights and they do a horrible job with accommodations. I strongly advise you to choose a different airline unless you feel like sleeping in the airport waiting for a flight 15 hours later.,0
"We got here 2.5 hrs early to buy our bags. But they wouldn't take payments over the phone and we couldn't buy them online without having to call customer service. We've been on hold with them for 1.5 hrs and still haven't been connected. A lot of flights have been cancelled due to 'weather', and they only tell the passengers when they go to get their boarding pass. They don't email or call them to let them know.",0
SV 038 on November 15 SV 560 on November 16 2014. Great service food and all around experience. The check in staff at Dulles Airport were very nice and moved me to a better seat. There were ample blankets and pillows. The food was far superior to other airlines. I really appreciated the lotions and skin fresheners in the bathrooms.,1
"Fort Lauderdale to Havana. I try to not use this airline when possible due to the rude staff, but this flight was the worst. I was in the bathroom when the attendants decided to serve drinks and they would not let me pass to my seat. I had to stand in the back of the plane the entire time they were serving approx 30 min. I will never fly Jetblue again nor will ever recommend them. And on top of it the staff were very rude.",0
"My boyfriend and I are regular traveller's and always use this airline. I'm deeply disappointed by this company's outrageous policy regarding their ""by piece"" luggage requirements. My additional bag weighed 14kgs, however I had to pay an additional R250 for a small 4kg bag, even though the combined weight of both bags were 5 kgs below the maximum weight. Is this the way to treat your regular and loyal customers, who are required to have one bag big enough to meet the maximum weight requirements?",0
"Our flight Vancouver to Honolulu was delayed and almost didn't make it to our scheduled tour. I thought maybe just this one time only. Then when when we go back home, our flight were cancelled. Hotels and taxis were compensated , we ended up stranded in a hotel. Never again we will fly with Air Canada. The delays and cancellation is not worth the money you spend. I won't recommend.",0
"Amsterdam to New York. Our flight got canceled. More than 300 people were lined up to re book the flights. It was a chaotic experience. Not organized for something like that. We could not get our luggage in case we want to fly on our own. Took us 4 hours to wait in line to re book the flight. Finally we got a flight that will be the next day and with transfer. I think KLM is a big company and may stand and help their customers to have better easier experience. Send us to a motel where we were given the worse food ever. And that after waiting for shuttle bus for another 2 hours. I never complain, but here we definitely should have been treated better. Such companies must be better organized. Allow people to choose the options of flying on their own. Be able to get out luggage. Be able to let people have choices. I would leave on my own if my luggage would be available to me. Hopefully someone will read that and help improve for others to have better experience in such situations.",0
I traveled by Go air flight G8194 from Leh to Delhi on 8th July 2018. My checked bags disappeared when I arrived in Delhi. I had a connecting flight and the airline staff promised to contact my as soon as possible. He said my bags would be sent to Bangkok on the next day. But Go air never contact me. I sent them several emails and they replied without update. I still do not know what happen to my bag. They never try to help and do not show any responsibility.,0
"It was enjoyable flight, except for delay because we was waiting for the aircraft to arrive from Bengkulu. Then, we were informed changing the waiting room from F5 to F6, because the aircraft arrived at the different gate. Quite messy, but the information was clear by ground staff. The inflight services were good.",1
"So I flew yesterday, 8 November 2017. Venice to Cologne. Went to the airport at 19.30 as the flight was scheduled at 21.30. After spending 2 hours to check my luggage in, confusion all around as no one was saying anything and we were all just standing. The staff notifies us that there was a problem with ""computers"" from the German side and hence the delay. No apologies given. So after another hour, finally checked my luggage in, had some extra weight, went and paid 50 euro for extra 4 kgs and that is fine but the staff member was a really a bad host. Not a smile, not an apology, more interested in making you pay. Good thing I booked extra leg room, drinks and snacks included, guess what? A cup of lukewarm coffee was all I got. The flight crew never apologized for the delay, no one from Eurowings did. Never again with this company.",0
"Terrible customer service. Will choose to never fly with them again. The aircraft entry staff is predatory, will make demands on charging for carry on and laptop bag even when items bought are only from duty free and within reasonable amounts of weight. The flights are always overbooked and staff at the doors are unhelpful if any queries are raised.",0
"The crew was warm and accommodating and so pleasant to be around. My wife and I brought our two young kids with us, our 2 year old was not thrilled about being forced to sit for take off and landing. The crew went above and beyond and had more patience for our kids than we expected. We loved our experience with PLAY and we would certainly fly with them again.",1
"Everything about this trip went like clockwork. The fare was only slightly more than coach with a checked bag. We arrived in SFO to be immediately checked in by a counter agent. We had a pet traveling in the cabin with us and there were no issues. It took only a couple of minutes. When we got to PreCheck security line there were only a couple of people ahead of us. After going through security we headed to the Alaska Air Lounge. The lounge was not that crowded, large, and spotless. There were plenty choices of food on offer, including an automatic pancake machine. At the gate, we were promptly boarded and greeted by the agent by our first names. The plane was a typical EM175 and the seats were very comfortable. Left on time and service was great, including the protein plate. We were able to see the larger peaks, such as Shasta, Hood, and Reiner. Landing at Everett was interested with all the Boeing wide bodies waiting to be painted. Deplaning was quick and picked up our bags in a couple of minutes. Could not have asked for better service!",1
I travelled from Heathrow to Melbourne assisted travel stopping at Dubai and Brunei. on 9th Dec and back on 4th Jan. The plane was comfortable the service excellent the staff were helpful and always cheerful the food was good and legroom was better than other airlines. I was not looking forward to the journey on my own but I couldn't fault anything including the excellent assisted service.,1
"Bratislava to Dublin. I fly with Ryanair quite often and I've always been happy with the airline until we were coming back from Bratislava. My husband had booked rows 33a and 33b at the back of the the plane, we used the back entrance and saw that people were in our seats, we mentioned this to the air hostess and she said 'oh sorry, special assistance are sat there now so you have to go to the front of the plane to row 2'. We had to go to the front of the plane trying to pass by passengers going into their own seats, I felt so stupid saying sorry repeatedly to people and explaining to them that our back seats were taken and we didn't know till now. We dont have a problem giving up our seats to those who needed it but it's worse when you are not told before you start to board the plane. Passengers, don't book the last seats on Ryanair because they dont understand how to communicate to each other, all they had to to was make an announcement and let us know.",0
"Pullman to Seattle. Absolutely the worst customer service I've had with an airline. I highly recommend not flying out of the Pullman Airport in Washington. The customer service left the check in desk and would not check me in, making me miss my flight. I arrived at the airport over 40 minutes early and others got there even earlier than that. All employees left the counter and would not check us in and made over 6 of us miss the flight. I'm never been treated worse by an airline in my entire life.",0
I recently flew Aer Lingus from Malaga to Dublin and then on to San Francisco again with Aer Lingus from Dublin the following day. I have never flown with Aer Lingus before but cannot fault either the flights or their customer service. We booked the enhanced meals on our return flights from Dublin to San Francisco and my only comment would be that although the outgoing meals were superb the incoming meals appeared to have been a little overcooked. Without exception all flights left on time and arrived early.,1
Norwegian was great to fly with. The Boeing 787 seats were very comfortable. The staff were friendly. My flights were all on time and check in was a breeze. The best part is that it was a direct flight from London to USA and return and extremely reasonably priced.,1
"I had a flight into Edmonton for a few meetings, and was scheduled to fly out immediately the next day. Somehow, I managed to join the same flight attendant crew on both flights. The Service Director, Dimitry, recognized me on the second flight and gave me a handwritten card expressing the crew's appreciation for little old me, economy class passenger, who was rushing to get home. What a nice touch! I showed it to my colleague who does the flight bookings for everyone in our office who's said she's never seen anything like that before. I really appreciated that kind gesture and excellent attention to detail! Air Canada is lucky to have such incredible and thoughtful staff.",1
"27 June 2014 flight LH454. I flew Lufthansa from Frankfurt to San Francisco on an A380 and it is not an experience I would like to repeat. I know flying economy is supposed to be uncomfortable and unpleasant on any airline but adding hundreds of passengers to what most other airplanes carry only compounds the misery. Space tight seats very narrow and food bland as usual for economy. What made this flight ""memorable"" were the long boarding lines and the length of time it took to get off the airplane after an 11 hour flight. I hope the A340 and the A330 airplanes stick around for a long time to come.",0
"Our flight to Rio de Janeiro from Frankfurt was delayed from 2200 in the evening to 0900 in the morning. Lufthansa couldn't provide a hotel because there are no hotels in the transit zone of Frankfurt airport, we had to sleep in the airport in the couches because we had no Schengen visa. The staff from Lufthansa sent us to zone B saying there is some sleeping area there, but there is nothing similar to that. He said that restaurants are open whole night there but that wasn't true and only 1 shop was working. On the flight back a flight attendant was rude, another one forgot we asked for tea. Food was poor, vegetarian pasta or chicken is not what I expect on a long flight. Sandwiches on the flight from Frankfurt to London were okay. We bought tickets well in advance and they were cheaper than others.",0
"Amsterdam to Mexico City. This is the worst airline ever. The seats are tiny and you cant move at all and really hard. The good is awful and you get two small meals on a ten hour flight, and one glass of water. The staff is rude, unfriendly.",0
I am extremely dissatisfied with the service I received on the evening of 26th Sep in Wroclaw airport related to a Ryanair flight. I paid extra for priority boarding both to and from Wroclaw. We departed from Cork last Sunday night and all was fine apart from minor delays at the final door prior to leaving the airport to make our way to the plane. On the other hand the service that we received in Wroclaw was an absolute disgrace. Both myself and my friend were the third and fourth in the queue went through the first check in gates to go down to the foyer leading to the Tarmac and plane. The other q passengers then went through their check in procedure. We all were massed in this small foyer for approx 20 mins and then they decided to open the gates and push approx 6 different families with buggies on top of us. Needless to say it was absolute bedlam by the time the doors were finally opened. There was an elderly Polish lady who had also paid for priority boarding who was pushed out of the way with the stampede to get to the plane. They really need to look at your procedures around check in and boarding as I have never experienced anything like this before. I would suggest that people with buggies should be checked in first and that these then should be placed in the foyer. The next passengers to be checked in should be priority passengers as after all they have paid for the privilege of this service! Finally the passengers who are in the alternative queue should then be checked in. The door should be manned to ensure that priority passengers are treated fairly.,0
"Last year's trip was okay. Air Transat failed us by bumping us out of Club Class at the last second. This year's trip rom Edmonton to Cancun that was to take place 6 weeks from now has been a nightmare. We booked 6 months in advanced and four months later were told that they had booked us into the middle of a major construction zone. Then 24 hours after paying off the balance of out trip they inform us that they were cancelling our direct flights and sending us through Calgary. Then they let us know that we were being bumped out of Club Class seats again after they were paid for. Strike, one, two and three. Never again will I give them a chance to screw up our vacation.",0
"This was the first time I had flown with ANZ and impressed by the service. I was originally supposed to fly from Auckland to Paraparaumu, got to the airport and the flight was cancelled. Air New Zealand had automatically booked me on the Wellington flight and arranged a car from Wellington Airport to Paraparaumu. Flight was smooth, inflight service was great, crew friendly and professional. Highly recommended.",1
"Booked my flight to Madrid and back on British Airways. Going to Madrid was on an A321, very nice seats and comfortable. The return leg from Madrid was a Boeing 767, the aircraft is old but the seats were very spacious and comfortable. The cabin crew were fantastic in their job, you only get snack for a short haul 2 hour flight, for the price and what is offered by British Airways it's worth it. Overall both journey was excellent, departed and arrived both legs on time.",1
"Best airline to fly for a family with an infant. Safety measures were as we expected, the crew was amazing with us and our baby. Due to corona they are not longer allow to take the baby stroller in transit in DOH but for us was ok because it was a short stop. I will always choose this airline for long journey!",1
"My appreciation goes to Capt Hendricks who piloted the plane from Portland to Boston. There were mechanical issues that delayed the plane for a little over 2 hours. The Captain Hendricks the issues to the passengers in a friendly, concise and comforting manner. He kept us updated throughout the repair process. His reassuring manner relaxed me and helped to keep everyone calm and in good spirits even though we had to disembark the plane for a time period. I want to also thank Alaska Airlines for the food voucher and for the voucher for a future flight. A great airline with wonderful employees. ",1
"BA used to be my go to carrier and I am a silver member. However their service seems to have gone hugely downhill. Flights get cancelled, the best alternative flights are offered and whilst in theory you can cancel or amend bookings online or on the app, invariably this is not possible. You cannot contact them by email and you may find yourself sitting on a phone for 40 plus minutes to speak to someone. If they are busy due to cancelled flights they need to employ people to answer calls and emails promptly. I was stunned by the recent cancellation to my Catania flight two weeks before I was due to travel.",0
"Macon to Gulfport. Excellent flight, excellent pilots and excellent stewardess. We were an hour late departing but safety comes first. We really enjoyed the flight in both directions and would recommend the airline to others easily. Thank you Sun Country, we look forward to our next flight with you!",1
"Kuala Lumpur to Labuan. Flight was delay over 2 hour. Little to none information was given until everybody was aboard the flight. Boarding was choas with ground staff not using the PA system.  Sudden change of gate, having to run from one gate to other due to limited seats at gate. Very hard on hand carry baggagge that even a small extra bag was sent away.",0
"Guangzhou to Sydney. I experienced a slight delay due to bad weather, had to spend around two hours wait before the weather condition back to normal. Cabin crew friendly and helpful. I cannot complain their onboard service much. Lovely smile, politeness and professional food service made the flying great. Last but not least, their seat is comfy and toilet is clean. China Southern is one of the best I flew on this route.",1
QF1 Sydney to London. The seats are very good a little hard after 14 hours and recline fully though I slept better slightly upright. Downside is that they are built in pairs and you feel the movement of a fidgety neighbour. The A380 seems short of toilets and they're tiny not great when so many people are using them to change to and from pyjamas. Crew very pleasant and efficient food excellent. Best was a smoked salmon and scrambled egg breakfast beautifully cooked. A very good experience.,1
"Manila to Cebu, and I recommend not to fly with Cebu Pecific. It is totally unreliable. I had a massive delay without any information whatsoever. The staff was hiding, the ground crew gave no information on the nature and the time of the delay. I recommend to use other local carriers for domestic flights.",0
We had a great flight going to Rome Friday evening. This is my first time using American airlines. The flight was full and the boarding was orderly. I found the seats very comfortable. I sat in the back of the plane. The flight was uneventful and we landed on time. The flight attendants were very friendly and helpful. I am happy to recommend flying American airlines and hope my return flight is just as successful as the first one.,1
"I do not think good customer services is provided to customers who travel with this selfish, in it for the profit and the profit, not concerned with people airline. During a national pandemic, this greedy airline has chosen to not give refunds. You could not pay me to ride or booked a flight with Spirit every in life again. Cheap is right!",0
"We booked a flight with British Airways, but it was actually American airlines that we travelled with. I have flown with quite a few airlines in the past and never came across such rude staff. The staff in Manchester Airport were lovely but the American Airlines flight attendants were extremely rude. On the return flight a smile never crossed their faces. Sullen, miserable and very very rude, flown with them once and would never fly with them again.",0
Rome to Istanbul. The original flight was initially delayed but we were given little information. Eventually we were told another aircraft would be coming from Istanbul and we would be given a meal. There were so many restrictions and inconsistencies with the meal provided. Information on the flight was not available despite several requests. Inaccurate information was given regarding the need to change boarding passes. The ground staff were next to useless and when the supervisor eventually arrived he was boarding of downright aggressive and would not rectify our problem with boarding passes. The flight was underwhelming. Inflight entertainment system was not working and my requested special meal was not available. On landing passengers were walking around the aircraft as it was moving. The cabin crew did nothing and even laughed at the child running up and down the aisle as the aircraft was moving.,0
My first and last time with Sunwings. The delays are terrible. The flight from Toronto to Vancouver on Dec 20th 2013 delayed almost 3 hours. My return flight on Jan 4 2014 most likely will be another 3 hours late.,0
The worst airline I ever experienced. Nothing deserves above 2 stars and no words to describe. I regret I did not read feedback before I booked my tickets.,0
"Melbourne to Guangzhou. I really recommend this airline, everything is wonderful. Staff are kind and patiently meet our demands timely. The entertainment equipment includes some TV series I am very interested in, so it is useful to kill time onboard.",1
Toronto to Amritsar via Delhi. The worst flight I have ever had. Screens were not working. Arm rest was falling apart. Usb port not working at all. Washroom was not even clean. Recommendation to other passengers this flight does not value your money or satisfaction,0
Dubai to Jeddah in November on an A380. New plane and great staff. The seat and IFE as expected. The only problem I had was not really fault of Emirates. Boarding was not a very pleasant experience as most of the passengers were pushing each other and were somewhat loud in their communication. Same story while disembarking. In JED we had to board a bus and it took forever to get to the terminal.,1
"Alitalia is a joke airline. My flight was delayed by 6 hours due to a fault in one of the engines. In London the ground crew did eventually try to find passage on other carriers, however some of the passengers were told that the plane had been fixed just as we got to the ticket counter of Lufthansa, so we had to go back through security which was a bit of a pain. There was no inflight entertainment and the inflight meals were very poor.  The staff on the flight also seemed a bit stressy. We had delays at Rome also. I tried to get a change of carrier for the return trip from my agent, but the cost of doing so would have been excessive. The return flight was similarly poor although there were no delays. However when I arrived at Heathrow I found that they had managed to break my suitcase lock.  When I went to the service desk they gave me a form and a claim number. I was tod to submit the form by email to their customer relations department. I sent my claim form as requested, however I was told that I had to download another form, fill it in, sign it and send a scan of this form and of my passport. I did this, but in error sent the unfilled form back instead of the signed scan. Any reasonable customer care department would realise that this was an error. I was told that I am no longer eligible for the compensation for my bag even though I subsequently sent the correct file. All in all I would say if you want a reasonable flight do not choose this shoddy airline.",0
"Toronto to Beijing. Feeling very good, airline staff often come to offer service. Toilets are clean. The buffet at the back of the cabin it is also good. Meals are also very fine. Many details are good, such as the introduction of the meal card, very fine.",1
SGN to Colombo and return. Smiling staff and friendly service. A pretty good meal on a fairly short flight with beer and wine included. Clean spiffy if not new Airbus equipment on both legs. Highly recommended.,1
"Didn't even get to use the flight, paid extra for a changeable fare and when my sister was ill I tried to change the flight to later in the year so that I could still use it and found out that they only post flights 2 months or so in advance so there is no way to use the flight. Waste of JPY 61,063.00. First time I flew with them when I was on the plane I discovered that they didn't provide water and they also would take a debit card so I had to do an 8hr flight with no water. Disgraceful.",0
"Albany to Charlotte. Was talked to like a dog from lady at the gate and then made me check a bag when I was carrying a book bag. Will never fly American again,  I asked why and she responded with none of my business. I was not asked if I would like a drink or snack anything, very dissatisfied with everything!",0
MAN to Orlando. Left early. Great seats upstairs on 747. Vera entertainment system fantastic food and drinks ok. Had friends in economy who also thought it was good. Cabin crew so friendly and attentive.,1
"I booked a flight to return from Basel to Amsterdam. This flight was cancelled and EasyJet made no effort to notify me. When I checked in to my departing flight, I saw on the app that the flight was cancelled. I called to have my flight rebooked to an earlier flight and explained my frustration at the fact that no one had contacted me in advance. I was told that my seats would be rebooked for the new flight to the extra legroom seats I had before. The next day I called again to explain that the reservation does not have me in an extra legroom seat as I paid for and asked this to be corrected. The person on the line was not willing to refund my fee as I that would mean I would also have to give up the cabin baggage allowance I also paid for. I explained to him how frustrated this was for me as a customer, and at the end of the call he asked me to hang up on me before he hung up on me himself. This is a poor example of customer service, and if the trip wasn't so last minute, I would ask for a refund and take my business elsewhere. I am not responsible for the flight being cancelled last minute and I made all the arrangements in advance to ensure a smooth trip. I am beyond disappointed in the service I've received and will consider this when making future reservations.",0
Bangkok to Frankfurt. Flawless flight experience. Cabin during night slightly too warm. In the rest nothing to complain and what I would expect from a first class service. Recommendable!,1
"Flew from Cape Town to Johannesburg. Check in at Cape Town unable to check luggage through to Sydney. Plane left 50 minutes late and had to wait 35 minutes for luggage in Johannesburg causing me to miss flight to Sydney. Ground staff and SAA help desk at Jo'burg all offered a ""I do not care attitude"". No help received or even offered. Last time I fly South African Airways.",0
"Colombo to London in February 2017. SriLankan Airlines has a car to door facility at business class check in at Colombo airport, and you sit down whilst a staff member checks in your bag and hands you a boarding card. Lounge is generic but was restful at 01.00 with polite staff. Priority boarding via separate gate. A warm and smiling welcome on board by cabin crew, greeted at seat and offered help with bag and coat storage. CSD adds a personal welcome. Usual drinks, hot towels and menu. After take off beverage delivered and a fast supper service offered. Full flat bed and slept 6 hours. When I awoke, crew offers me coffee using a silver tray, a sandwich and a hot towel. All with a warm smile and with a nothing is too much trouble approach. Wonderful breakfast menu. On time arrival. Bags waiting as I arrive at carousel. I did not use the inflight entertainment system as a night flight but the range and quality seemed excellent. Limousine driver waiting at arrivals. Home 2 hours after landing. I thought they were excellent.",1
"Bengaluru to Kolkata. On this early morning flight, I had arrived at the airport much ahead of schedule and despite that, I still managed to check in and print the boarding pass selecting my seat which saves on the money if one were to check online. Baggage drop was easily done and the agent at the desk was with a pleasant demeanor. Boarding started ahead if schedule on this flight and was warmly greeted by the flight attendants. As it was during the Christmas time, the background music was related to the holidays which was a nice touch. Departure was on time and the rest of the flight passed off uneventfully. Arrival was on time and was able to collect my baggage as well. Only thing I observed was that the key chain of my bag was missing even though the contents of the bag appear to be intact. And I am not sure if the airline or any of the baggage handlers might be responsible for the loss of the keychain. But it could quite easily have resulted in the loss of any other items so I am not sure. This aspect has the only negative over what was by and large a flawless flight.",1
"Flew with Air Serbia from Belgrade to Milan and back a couple of days after. Online check in with hand luggage only. Both flights were on time, cabin clean and neat, cabin service immaculate, friendly and well groomed cabin crew. Food served was sandwich and selection of drinks. Overall, great and professional service, well maintained and cleaned aircraft cabin, friendly and very informative announcments by both captains on both journey legs.",1
Flew from Luton to Ercan Northern Cyprus via Istanbul on the whole a poor experience. On the outbound flight our tickets said the flight was 12.20 but it was in fact displayed as 12.00. Check in staff were unfriendly put the wrong seat numbers on our boarding cards which we spotted otherwise our family would have been separated. Boarding was called 20 minutes before the inbound aircraft arrived and the aircraft left late resulting in standing in line for over an hour to board as there was minimal seating in the boarding area. The interior of the aircraft was dark and gloomy cabin lights were left off. The seating was cramped which meant the passenger in front could not recline his seat. The cabin service was shambolic the crew attempted to serve food and drinks from the same trolley and were constantly running our of things and were going up and down the aisles for more items constantly took over an hour to serve the meal. The meal was disgusting and was stone cold and my drink was half a glass of flat diet coke the crew had run out and didn't want to get another bottle. Staff were not friendly and continually forgot to serve people due to the distraction of running out of food. For most of the flight the aisles were blocked with crew with trolleys and food trays were not collected for a long time. Combined with turbulence it was not possible to visit the two economy class toilets for some time and it was not allowed to use them on the ground in Istanbul. On a positive note baggage collection and immigration in Ercan was fast and efficient. The return flight was slightly better boarding was more ordered cabin service more organised and cabin light switched on. Check in however was shambolic. When we landed at Istanbul most passengers had to change seats but had not been advised resulting in chaos and families being split up. Overall a very unpleasant journey I have flown on over 40 airlines and this was one of the worst.,0
"I recently completed my journey on Qatar Airways to Dubai via Doha from London and back. On the way out the aircraft was an A380 which was fantastic. The staff were polite and the comfort level for economy was very good. On my return journey the stewardess attending to us ensured a high level of service, she was always smiling and ready to help.",1
"Flew with two relatives for a couple of days in Chiang Mai, from Bangkok. Thai Smile are an absolute joy to fly. They might be the low cost branch of Thai Air but there is nothing cut price about their service. Online check in with free choice of seats, 20 kilo baggage allowance. We ended up checking four bags in even though there was only three of us without any problem at all. The seats were comfortable with plenty leg room. Flights took off on time. Return leg landed a little behind schedule but that was down to air trafficcontrol in Bangkok. Cabin crew were brilliant. Happy and living up to the brand name, smiling throughout. Sandwich provided, which is something a well known high price British airline is unable or unwilling to provide these days. Will have no hesitation in booking Thai Smiles again.",1
"This was my first time Etihad Airways, flying from New York to Abu Dhabi. Things seemed fine for the first couple of hours then about 6 hours into the flight, the person sitting next to my daughter got sick and threw up all over. My daughter had it on her blanket which saved her clothes, the armrest and seat she was sitting in. The smell was horrible. We rang for the stewardess from 3 different places and no one showed until the gentleman in front of us went to get someone. A stewardess came and tried to clean it up but she too was getting sick, so she said I will put a blanket over the seat and then you can sit. We refused to sit on vomit. She told me to go find another seat. I looked but most of the plane was asleep and you could not see where there were any empty seats. I told her people were asleep and she said ""wake them up"". I said no, you wake them up it is your job. This was a very special trip my daughter and I, planned as we never had the opportunity to do a mother daughter trip before. Now we could not even sit near each other for the remainder of the trip. It was a nightmare.",0
Milan to Buenos Aires for the second time in this month. Arrived at the airport checked in and ground agents never told me the flight was delayed. I spoke with a lady who told me that she knew it before checking in. I could have called and change my ticket. Crew only spoke Portuguese no English. Very poor service. Landed in Sao Paulo and connecting to a flight that would take me to Buenos Aires. Impossible. Flight cancelled. Agents said we would be taken to a hotel because other flights were full. I asked an agent who spoke Italian a ground agent who made me fly with GOL airlines and land in a small city airport in Buenos Aires. Will ask my company to change my return. Not flying a Brazilian airline anymore.,0
Checked in on line with no problem. Get to the airport with plenty of time to spare to find the flight has been cancelled with no explanation as to why. Put on a Thai Airways later flight making our transfer in Bangkok too tight to be comfortable. We made it with minutes to spare with extra assistance from Bangkok ground staff. This made what should have been two simple flights with ample time in between very stressful and tiring. Staff at Luang Prabang were very helpful and did their best but I wouldn't book Bangkok Airways again.,0
"I had flown with this airline on numerous occasions on the same route. Never had any major issues. I bought a ticket for my mom. I always do check in at home at least 12 hours before flight. But unfortunately the app and website didn't let me check in. We arrive at the airport 2 hours before take off and the woman at the counter asks us where we're flying and we tell her. Her response is you're not flying tonight. I'm like what do you mean? She says airline policy is you to arrive 3 hours before. I explained what happened with the error message and she rolls her eyes and calls another employee. He says the same thing. I ask well what about the ticket we purchased, with insurance. He says not our problem and gives us the 800 number to try to resolve the issue. So we start calling at the airport. Then a guy came up to us and said to do the checkin in the app because he had just done it. So clearly the flight was not closed. I tried in the app again but no luck. No one answered after an hour waiting. We left the airport because her flight left. At home I kept calling and another 50 minutes without any answer. So I had to buy my mom another flight because she had to be there the next day for her brother's funeral. I called early morning to try to get help with the refund. And i asked about their policy about flight closing, she stated it closes 1 hour before. When I asked the insurance they said the reason for missed flight was not under the 27 clauses and that I should of called an hour before take off. I said I did but they didn't answer. I called the 800 line at the same time another day and no answer. When I spoke to a supervisor I asked him ""how am i at fault if their employees don't answer or do their job"" he rudely said they always answer the line. So we bought insurance for nothing and forced to pay for an emergency flight. When I went to pick up my mom at the airport days later I went to the departures floor for the airline. I asked an employee about the flight closing policy and she again stated it closes 1 hour before. I asked to speak with a supervisor and she said he was ""busy"". So I left my name and phone number. It's been a week and no answer. This airline has the worst employees who don't do their job and aren't held accountable. Avoid at all costs!",0
AC1851 Toronto to Las Vegas April 17th. Wifi kept on cutting out and finally never worked. The service was very slow no one passing in the alleys. The flight attendant call button on all seats was non functional until I complained about it and then it was turned on 2.5 hrs into the flight. Bathrooms are dated and not very clean ran out of paper towels halfway through the flight and never replaced. Price is similar to Air Canada flights yet Air Canada Rouge is like a third world airline. I had to ask 3 times for decaf coffee over a period of 2 hours. Very poor customer service. It is unacceptable that on a long flight both the entertainment system and service are terrible.,0
My daughter flew with Sunwing return  Vancouver to Toronto. Flights were delayed in both directions so they would leave after midnight. I have been advised this is done intentionally to pay lower airport departure fees. We flew with Sunwing a number of years ago and they were doing the same thing.,0
They delayed my flight by 3 days and were incredibly rude and unapologetic. I was supposed to fly from Sydney to Buenos Aires via Auckland and Santiago. I turned up at the check in counter in Sydney and was told the flight would be delayed because the plane hadn't arrived yet from Auckland but it would only be a couple of hours. When I returned they said the plane would not be arriving after all and that we would not leave Sydney for another two days. Staff were rude and unhelpful and once we were taken to the accommodation we didn't hear from them again except for a piece of paper under the hotel door telling us to be ready at 5am. After two days we went back to airport there was no staff member there and we had to go from counter to counter trying to find out which flight we were on. After finally checking in and going through immigration we were at the boarding gate when we were told that we would not be flying out after all as there was no plane to meet us in Auckland. No staff representative. I ended up changing to LAN Chile who were excellent.,0
"Barcelona to San francisco via Montreal with Air Canada rouge. I'm a frequent traveller and this airline has been one of the worst ones I've tried. From customer service to plane. I'm a Star Alliance gold member and on both flights, I was seated completely separated from my wife and we were on the same booking. It doesn't help the staff were impolite and we were delayed. No seatback entertainment either and even if you download the app, the movie selection is old. It's sad really, I heard a lot of bad things but expected the staff service to be good so I wanted to give them a proper shot. I was wrong. Believe the reviews. It's a budget airline for a reason. This was the only airline arriving at the time I needed in SFO, if there were other options, I definitely would've gone the other way.",0
"Dublin to Manchester. Awful. Usually fly on alternative airline on this route but booked late and this was cheaper. You get what you pay for! Cabin dirty and unacceptable. Flight was 1 hour late and not a single employee, not ground staff, cabin or cockpit crew apologised for the delay which I'm sure comes from senior management. Manners cost nothing. Never again",0
"We were flying from Tirana to Male, Maldives for honeymoon. Our baggage didn't arrive and then they said we will check they answer very late in emails or don't answer at all. We were having a very difficult time in Maldives because we don't have any clothes with us. And two days remaining to our vacation now, still no baggage still, no information. I wouldn't recommend this airline.",0
"I thought I had seen everything in Aeromexico, but this airline keeps surprising me. This time we boarded 30 minutes late, they had us 2 hours on the plane without actual notice from the staff that was what happened, while maintenance personnel entered and left the plane several times. And lie after lie from the staff which gave reason for the passengers who wanted to get off the plane, and the staff did not let him down. Finally, after more than 2 hours, the Aeromexico plane took off and we don't know if the plane was broken. Casually Aeromexico has not commanded a satisfaction survey from that flight.",0
Beware you are not going to get what you expect. Took a flight from TX to Charlotte. Awful experience. As the misery grew on my overnight layover so did the displeasure. People lying all over the airport due to miss connections. I saw a family of 8 sleeping on the floor due to flights delays and all American agents had to offer was I'm sorry. No empathy at all. Trailer at your own risk.,0
"The absolute worst customer service I have ever experienced in my over 60 years on this earth. My wife and I were held hostage under the ruse my 7.30 pm flight would eventually take off. After over nine hours and several false explanations, our flight was ultimately canceled sometime after 2 am. Jetblue was completely uncaring, incompetent and uncooperative in offering any assistance.",0
"Los Angeles to Taipei. I was impressed with the service and leg room. The flight attendance made rounds frequently to offer water and juice and sometimes snacks. There was plenty of leg room very comfortable for me at 5' 9"". I chose EVA because it was the best rate at the time.",1
"Had a delay with United which meant we missed our connection to Delhi. Lufthansa was prompt in rebooking us with BA via LHR and got us the only 3 business class seats remaining on the connecting Lufthansa flight from Frankfurt to Heathrow. Due credit be given to Lufthansa ground staff for their quick and efficient handling of the issue. A320 was slightly old, seats narrow and no entertainment system on this short flight. However, we were still given a special meal despite being rebooked only about an hour and a half prior to departure. Saw one of the most beautiful sunsets arriving at Heathrow.",1
"I am a flyer on Southwest. Perhaps not as much as most people, but a number of flights per year. I have a Southwest Rapid Rewards number. I was flying to Portland from Ontario, CA, with a stop in Sacramento. I was going to see my Mother in Salem, her health had deteriorated rapidly after falling and breaking her hip. She was sent home under hospice care with as little as a week to live. I was determined to see her. We landed in Sacramento which showed a 4 hour layover. I didn't want to delay and needed to get to Salem. I checked Alaska and they had a flight that would arrive 2 hours earlier. I booked the flight and flew Portland. After arriving in Portland drove to Salem to see my Mother. That afternoon I received an email from Southwest informing me that the rest of my itinerary had been canceled and all payments forfeited. I called and the support person said because I didn't cancel the flight, and didn't inform them, that my return trip was canceled and money forfeited. I guess I forgot to read the fine print. Because of this policy, even though I felt it more important to get to my Mother's side, I now didn't have a return flight. I used to fly Southwest. But with that uncaring, insensitive response to stand by their rules. I am no longer a Southwest flyer. I will tell everyone I can my story, and encourage them NOT to fly Southwest.",0
"Dublin to Kuala Lumpur via Dubai. Emirates website has a fixed character to insert your name as per passport when booking flights. As my name was too long i could not insert the whole thing. I had the same problem before and I was told to book my flight and ring the help line after. I did the same this time and was charged an extra 30 dollars to add characters to my name. It is absolutely ridiculous, I would understand if the mistake was on my part. But this is solely due to the lack of characters available when booking.",0
They rebooked my connection for no reason. Had to wait 8 hours for a new flight. Staff are extremely unhelpful and rude. One of the worst customer service experiences I've had.,0
First time flying Allegiant Air from New Orleans to Pittsburgh. Was pretty skeptical at first reading all the bad reviews but I didn't have a moments trouble and will definitely be flying with them again soon.,1
We caught a flight going from Houston to Newark in December of 2020 they put us on the plane flew us over Maryland and turned us around because of weather once back in Houston we had to wait on this long line to be told you can't get a refund only a credit and they had no more flights for about over a week. Since it was covid I couldn't travel like I usually did then got sick in 2021 where I called them to explain the rep said no problem if you can't travel by the expiration date call us and they will extend your credit. After calling them I was told that I just lost my money. I will never fly them again because if it was their fault they should have first off given us our money back but them in the end took our money.,0
Truly a 5 star airline. The staff on board were so professional and attentive. I had the best filet mignon ever at 40000ft. The champagne and wine are so well chosen. We flew from LAX to ICN and then ICN to SGN. Both flights were fantastic. Great cabin crew and looking forward to fling them again.,1
"I was flown down for an interview in Houston. The flight leaving Denver was delayed at last 2 hours making me late for my interview. The flight was pretty uneventful except there is a charge for everything. The flight back to Denver was delayed 4 hours with lots of excuses from the gate staff. At the same time they are telling us this rarely happens, I was looking online and finding that every flight for the last two was signigicantly late. There was another flight at the same gate that was 4 hours late also. There was almost a riot at the gate because it was night and people were tired and so angry. ",0
"Today my group of 23 people booked a trip with Tigerair TT229 Sydney to Melbourne, the flight was cancelled. Staff Tigerair at the airport did not take care of the customers. Lack of responsibility, and would not help us book other flight. Please do not fly with Tigerair.",0
"We travelled Spirit flight scheduled to reach Cleveland has reached at approx 12.35 pm. Not able to explain the reasons our family during that odd hour at Cleveland. Again today board and deboarding had happened. Authorities do not know when the flight will leave, maybe at 8pm now 9 pm. They do not provide water much less food. They have scant respect towards passengers Covid announcement but appears to be ritual. Not at all serious. Entire family is in airport since 10 am. Prakash",0
The absolute worst airline I have ever flown. They canceled my flight yesterday and rescheduled for today. They have no agreements with other airlines to get a flight home. Then they did not board rescheduled flight until 2 hours later then scheduled time. No one was at the desk to provide information. Only after everyone on the plane did they announce the direct flight to Los Angeles was being directed to Tampa Florida where we would have to change planes because the plane we were on was missing a part? Do not fly this airline!,0
Overall a horrible experience. Booked a vacation to Cancun through this company. I can understand delays due to weather and safety. My wife and I both seated in different sections for both directions of our trip. We requested seats together but this seems to be too complicated of a task for this company. Found that there were many other couples and families that this happened to as well. Seats extremely cramped on plane. Mine was broken did not recline. Also when we arrived in Cancun and boarded our bus for our transfer to resort we waited for approx 70 mins after getting on bus to leave airport. We landed at 1.30 pm and were told it was approx 45 mins to our resort. Problem was that this bus carried many other Sunwing customers going to other resorts and the bus was to stop at each one. Ours was the last. We did not arrive to our resort until 6.30 pm! Approx 4 hours later! Will never use Sunwing again.,0
Dublin to Keflavik with WOW air. Very misleading from the start. They charge 38 euro each way for each bag when the carry on luggage is bigger than a small backpack. How can anyone travel that light? Such a waste of money. They also pick and choose who they charge as there were people ahead of me let through with the same size baggage. A terrible experience from a frequent flyer.,0
"Delhi to Bali via Kuala Lumpur. My flight was late and the staff is not empathetic. They do not care about the consumer and are only worried about passing on the work to someone else. Food is horrendous. Connecting flights a big no no, since original flights gets delayed all the time one tends to miss connecting flight as well. Then one had to pay additional to book another flight. Inflight entertainment is one of the worst I have seen on international planes. No new movies or TV shows.",0
Toronto to Las Vegas during March Break 2013. We got in early on the way to Vegas. I chose Sunwing for the daytime flights. All other airlines have overnight flights to Vegas. Plane was a bit delayed on the way back coming in but the actual flights were great considering the time of year. Yes it's cramped in the plane but that's what charter is all about. I don't know any other airline nowadays that gives you free checked luggage food drinks twice plus snacks for a 4 hour flight.,1
Boston to New York JFK. A very unprofessional airline. If you don't want to be frustrated dont travel with American Airlines. Today 28 March I boarded on time to go to JFK and at the last minute they announced that the flight is cancelled. No reason. I was suposed to connect to an international flight from JFK but I missed it. They gave me a late flight via LGA instead of JFK. they didn pay for my hotel and worse still they even didn't apologise.,0
"Bangkok to Delhi. Added Spicemax to our ticket and it was worth it. Had a complimentary Glenfiddich with my free meal. Food was good, if a bit bland. Leg room was good in seat 7E. Staff were pleasant and on the ball. Tiniest toilet I've ever been in, but we don't spend much time there! Highly recommended.",1
"Dreadful, never again! Lost bags both ways. Lost for 4 days on outbound, no help, no reply to emails, messages, utter useless. Still trying to claim for essentials but no one ever replies. Check in utter chaos both ways, massive queues and no one gives a damn. Loads of people in hotel also Lost bags, it seems common on TAP. On board crew friendly, food ok outbound but dreadful on return. Plane was ok. In the air they were ok but the ground side is beyond useless especially in regard to Baggage.",0
Emirates has got to be the best value for money for any premium carrier. The pick up from home is excellent they will take you to an airport hotel the night before. Check in was friendly quick and efficient. The lounges in Manchester and Dubai are lovely and peaceful. The food was good and the Wifi works. We will gloss over the Bidvest lounge in Cape Town. The suite has everything you could possibly want. The seat have everything from upright to completely flat. The food was absolutely first class the wines were excellent and the service from the crew was attentive and friendly.,1
"Gatwick to Istanbul. , staff from Menzies Aviation and the cabin crew have been very rude. Wont even choose this  again, split our seats me and my husband sitting on different seats, despite we reserved the seats beforehand! Flight delayed as well about 30 minutes without appropriate explanation. Very annoyed.",0
"Fort Lauderdale to Cancun with Jetblue Airways. The worst airline ever! First of all very rude flight attendants, in the beginning of the boarding, I was drinking water and had my mask under my nose, same for my husband, he came to us and said to put the mask over our nose, than he said if there is a problem with that to let him know now, so we can leave the plane before they close the doors! This is just ridiculous.",0
"Maui to Calgary. A very smooth flight and service was great. My problem happened when we landed. While getting ready to depart, I couldn't find my passport. I got a little upset as to where it could be. I had it obviously to get on the plane and now I did not. Westjet personnel were very quick to help my search as well as some other passengers. We looked until the whole plane had departed all the while Westjet personnel were calm and supportive. They quickly realized my partner was a little stressed as well and suggested a wheel chair. Within minutes we were heading toward customs, being calmed down by Westjet personnel. Even customs were very calm. This is were I went through my partners huge purse and lo and behold found everything. Feeling frustrated and rather stupid, Westjet saw the humor in this as probably they have done on many other occasions. I appreciated theirhelp all the way out to the taxi line at arrivals. At no time time did they say or behave in a negative way towards my partner or myself. Great service all the way around and we thank you Westjet and personnel for your calming effect after a long day.",1
Arrived at CDG 3 hours before flight with my young daughter to be told that our flight home was overbooked and that this wasn't unusual as Air France overbook all of their flights. We were handed standby by boarding cards and 3 hours later at 9pm it was confirmed that we wouldn't be able to board the plane by the most bored looking ill mannered unhelpful and unsympathetic customer service representative I have ever encountered. We were eventually taken elsewhere and issued with a voucher for a hotel and meal. We were vaguely pointed in the direction we needed to travel and told that with children it would take about 45 minutes to get across the airport to the hotel shuttle bus stop. After a torturous trek across the airport we eventually got to the bus stop and then to our hotel so late that the restaurant had long since closed and the only food available was from a vending machine.,0
"Nice experience, staff are very friendly since the beginning of trip. Want to say thanks again to all the people that gave our help. I appreciated the all effort China Southern Airlines made, and that give us the chance to go back to hometown in such a special covid year.",1
"Jakarta to Yogyakarta. A short but pleasant flight. Even though it is just a short flight, all of the services expected from a full fledged carrier is being given. Meal is not given because it is short distance, but light snacks and drinks are still given. All of the flight attendants are really pleasant, and all of the niceties is present even though it is just a short flight. The landing on the other hand is a bit rougher than usual Garuda Indonesia's flight.",1
"Hong Kong to Colombo. Sri Lankan used to be my favourite airlines for traveling to Bangkok and Colombo, but they have stopped flying to Bangkok from Hong Kong, but opera 5 direct flights instead. Due to the low load factor, they now use a smaller A320 aircraft, but the newest one called NEO. The leg room in business class is quite good, good recliner seat with foot rest, suitable for a 5 hour flight. Their onboard service and catering have always been outstanding, such as the case in this trip. They have a good touch screen AVOD too, and a decent headphone. They also have a wonderful array of teas, which is what Sri Lanka is famous anyway. From Hong Kong direct to Colombo, SriLankan airlines is the only airlines that does that, and luckily, they are a very good choice. They are part of OneWorld, so you can earn mileage if you are members of any of the One World airlines.",1
"Doha to Kuwait. I tried to travel during the heavy rains in Kuwait, had to wait 6 hours to check in and after that 6 hours at the gate. Kuwait Airways representative was hiding, no info, no service at all. I decided to cancel my ticket, went back to the check in counter and after I tried to do the same through their whatsapp as well but no answer at all. Sent email for refund, same story. They are not answering the phone either. I regret choosing this cheap airline, but will never make the same mistake again.",0
"Just returned from a quick five day jaunt to Eugene, OR, flying Alaska Airlines. Bumped up to First class both ways due to my Gold status and some luck as well. The flights were great, crews professional, clean planes, good food and on time both directions. I had the pleasure of sitting next to a WWII former fighter pilot whose son is a Captain with Alaska. He was quite a hit with the crew as he seemed to be well known. I enjoyed his company and he made the flight an unforgettable experience. Departing in a week or so to fly to Raleigh NC on the first ever Alaska Airlines flight to grace the Tarheel State. ",1
Singapore to Bangkok. This airline denied me boarding even though I had a confirmed flight. Their own portal sent me the confirmation and receipt for the ticket I paid for. Yet the counter claimed they had no record of the booking and Thai Lion Air claimed I had not paid for the return flight despite having issued a receipt. I am taking this up with my Insurance and consumer protection authorities. I am totally shocked by this behavior.,0
"Flew London Gatwick to San Jose Costa Rica. We have flown business on numerous occasions and have noticed the decline in British Airways. The service on this flight was appalling. Travelling as a couple we were sat in the centre seats which the cabin staff appeared to ignore when offering any of the cabin services i.e. drinks, towels etc.. the normal routine stuff. On too many occasions we had to request attention. Chosen meals were not available on both outward and return flights and we were sat in row 2 at the front of the service. Collection of waste items had to be requested. The galley kitchen was not restocked and by the end of the flight looked like a bomb site, no glasses or cups were available for even a glass of water. Cabin staff were noticeable by their absence during most of the flight. Hot towels will soon be the size of a postage stamp. Toilet bags are cheap. BA have totally lost the plot. They are no longer a premium service and Willie Walsh and Co. need to take a flight on Emirates, Qatar etc. to realise their failings. Business seating configuration is ridiculous. Passengers in the centre seats have to hurdle their way to the isle over the isle passengers legs. As part of the same trip we made domestic flights to connect. Again service is in reverse but the costs aren't. If BA wants to become a budget airline then they need to offer budget fares. I don't think they have a clue what they are doing. In future we will avoid them unless absolutely necessary. The only positive of the trip was the lounge at Gatwick. The lounge at San Jose is a joke.",0
Luton to Athens. Just shocking. Flight delayed because the pilot got on the wrong plane. Waited for 30 mins after the flight was supposed to take off until we were told what was going on. No where to sit in the departure lounge so we waited on the floor.,0
"Brisbane to Sydney. I was coming with my boss who booked in business class and was waiting in a queue to board the flight a few mins ago. I am very disappointed and upset with the way that I have been treated when we tried to scan in and board on the flight, I realise I was only in economy but when I tried to scan and get in, the lady who was working in the front told me that it's only business class and gold class customers allowed to get in at the time and I was supposed to go all the way back and have a seat until economy is called out. It didn't make much of a difference to just let me in instead of embarassing me in front of everyone and asking me to leave. I have previously travelled with Virgin and have never experienced this sort of behaviour but I am extremely disappointed and upset of being treated this way today.",0
"Dubai to Stockholm. I bought wine in the duty free airport and then I check in these items as hand carry, the staff don't allow me to use the trolley and also don't put the fragile for the check in item. I had to bring 15 kg stuff all the way to the bus and the plane. They refuse to put fragile for the check in and said if got any problem we are responsible.  No staff is helping me to carry my things to plane. This is my first time to take this airline and also my last time.",0
"London to Bali via Bangkok. Thai Airways left my luggage on the way to my destination. They said it would be on the next flight. After persistent emails the only places I could get responses out of were the Bali airport luggage department and their twitter account. Both of which consistently knew nothing and send me away to contact other departments and email addresses. 6 days later they found a bag that matches mine. Upon confirmation it was clear the bag never left England. As I was no longer in Bali I requested the bag to not leave the country and be sent to a home address as sending it to Bali would cause it to be further lost. The next day I get an email saying ""good news"" we're sending it to Bali right now. To which I got a boat back and two hour drive, plus a hotel to get to the airport to find they decided to put it on the next one. Eventually I got the bag 16 hrs before my flight back to the UK. The whole thing cost me a fortune and I was one of several people this happened to on the flight. Further to this the flight was pretty poor with meal choices that ran out.",0
"This is the second time I was screwed by Frontier. Should have learned my lesson the first time. I booked with them because they were the only airline with a direct flight from Vegas to Puerto Vallarta. But on both occasions, they cancelled my flights, both legs of the round trip, with less than 1 week notice. They offered no alternative booking, so I had to scramble for tickets with another airline at the last minute and ended up paying much more than I would have if I had booked a different airline months ago. So, bottom line, you don't save money by booking with this airline. You end up spending more in addition to the added hassles. I also had travel insurance, but it did not cover the added cost of changing airlines. It would only have covered it if I was at the airport on day of travel and got cancelled.",0
"In 2020, when every other airline was trying to cheat me, Lufthansa went above and beyond and gave me even better terms than my contract entitled me too. They were also rather gracious when I showed up with oversized luggage, and did not charge me extra, although they could have. Of all the airlines I've been flying with, this is the one one that I have no complaints about.",1
Flight got canceled twice for the same day without any compensation. Worst customer service. Would not recommend. You're better off with any other airlines,0
This was a lovely flight from Hobart to the Gold Coast on Tigerair. Boarding was orderly. We walked to the plane and boarded through the rear. I had row to myself in the second last row. I will travel with them again.,1
"Jakarta to Munich via Muscat . They have the worst customer service and I would never book a ticket again. We had to change a flight and then the problems started. They told us how much it would cost, but we couldn't pay online. They gave us their bank account number and we had to go to the bank to pay for it. After three days that we paid for the change we got an email that the price for the ticket change and that we have to pay double. We called to local customer services that we dont want to pay that anount and that we dont understand how can that happen. They said that they can refund the additional money that we paid. But then got complicated because they had to do international transfer and they had to charge US a tranfer fee. In addition them we wanted to cancel first flight and when we called local and then Oman customer services noone knew how much money we get back if we even get any. We wrote them an email and got no answer. We talked with them on FB and Whatsup and noone had any answers. Their customer support is just there that you can call them but they do not know anything. They can check your flight and that is it. I think they know the same as you when you enter your booking number on the internet. So think twice before you book a flight with them.",0
"Orlando to Bogota. Worst seats I ever had. This airline charges for everything. The maximum weight for your luggage is 40 lbs while all others are 50 lbs. In flight you get nothing, no water, nor assistance.",0
I travelled today from Alicante to Manchester on flight LS880. All I can say is that whilst the flight had a brief delay through no fault of the airline the cabin crew were the most helpful and friendly that I have come across on any airline.,1
"Larnaca to Singapore via Dubai. Our flight from Cyprus got delayed more than an hour so we missed our connecting flight from Dubai to Singapore. As all other airlines do we thought that a group of flight attendants wold escort us to the new gate to catch the next flight, we also informed the flight attendants in our flight from Cyprus to Dubai to do so and they ensured us that this was going to be done and nothing to worry about. We needed to reach Singapore the following morning as we had a very important meeting arranged at the airport. However coming out the aisle none called our names and none would answer our questions on how to reach the next gate. They would only tell us that we missed the next flight as well and that there is no chance of us arriving on time to the gate to get the next one. After a lot of drama with the useless connection manager we lost a lot of valuable time with result of missing the next flight as well. It was simply horrible. Never experienced worse service in my life, not even with a budget airline. After arranging to stay in Dubai in order to have our meeting online we realized that we got an email from the airline that they rescheduled our seats for the following flight, and we could have made it on time if we saw the email earlier and not listed to the negative outcome from the unhelpful ''manager''. This is the second time this happened to my husband with this airline and we want to tell the travelers out there not to waste their valuable time and money well earned to throw it to them. Any other airline is much better!",0
"Delhi to Jammu. Horrible airline. Our flight was cancelled at the last minute with no weather issues in Delhi, I flew in from Sydney and had onward trips planned. It caused me and my parents discomfort and financial damage due to Goair cancellation. To make the experience worse the ground staff was extremely rude and unapologetic. I had to cancel all my bookings including my return fares from Jammu which were in total of INR 30,000. I would not recommend Goair.",0
Well organized and very systematic boarding and unboarding. Cordial staff with smiles. Simple internet booking and special discount for senior citizens that touch the heart.,1
"My first flight was delayed due to weather. Understandably, it's winter. I expressed my concern that because of the one hour delay I would not be able to make my connection flight and immediately sought out an attendant. The attendant understood, and reserved a backup flight in case the our original second flight took off before we landed. Once we landed we discovered that before we even were taxied to the gate our backup was cancelled and our connecting flight was in the air. On a call to customer relations they couldn't do anything for us until tomorrow. Leaving us in Dallas. We talked back and forth until they said they could set us up on a backup flight to a town 70 miles away from our ending destination. Who knows how this will end up. I've always flown Delta and have never had a problem. Will never use American Airlines again.",0
"I'm very happy with the service. I had a flight from Bangkok via Nairobi to Addis. Originally I booked the flight with a transit time in Nairobi. So I arrived in the morning and the original flight was supposed to go in the evening. In Bangkok they also checked me in for the second flight in Nairobi. Although I had the boarding pass I didn't realize that the time had changed to the morning flight. I was so sure that the flight would be in the evening that I read the time 6.35 as the evening time, although that's obviously in the morning. When I finally realized this they booked me on the next flight for the next morning and booked a hotel with 2 meals included, plus the shuttle all for free. So very thankful for everything and I also got the transit Visa renewed without extra cost. I can recommend this airline for the good service and my good impression I had for the flight from Bangkok to Nairobi. Thanks a lot Kenya Airways.",1
Amsterdam to Atyrau. I am a regular user of Air Astana for work purposes and have been for over a year now. I had never heard of Air Astana before so I was very skeptical to say the least. What a mistake that was. I would put Air Astana right along big international carriers. The on board service and food are excellent the flights are on time. The cabin crew are very professional and language skills are excellent.,1
I am a 75k elite member on Air Canada routes I would normally have flown Air Canada on I will switch to WestJet or a US airline. Great way to loose loyal customers Air Canada. I had to change a flight that now routed me through LA to Vancouver the last leg on Rouge. The seats were so uncomfortable and perhaps the tightest fit I have experienced when not in a private prop plane. I will never fly Rouge again and think about no longer flying with Air Canada.,0
"Guangzhou to London. I enjoyed flying with China Southern Airlines until landing. It was very cloudy in London and suddenly the plane went for a second round. There were no information from pilot. After few minutes, flight attendant informed us about something out of control but her accent was so weird that, there were still more questions in the air than answers. They should informed passengers better, that pilot would say few words in English.",0
We flew on the Dreamliner from Manchester to Cancun. We opted to upgrade to premium seating. The experience was well worth the money. Every aspect about the flight was all that was advertised. If only all flight experiences were like this.,1
"We booked tickets from Guayaquil to JFK with a 2 hr 20 min layover in Bogota. The plane that was going to take us from Guayaquil to Bogota was delayed by 20 minutes, so Avianca automatically rebooked us on the next flight from Bogota to New York which would take off nine hours after our original flight. On our flight from Guayaquil to Bogota, the plane took off before they finished the safety video. When we landed in Bogota 15 minutes after our scheduled time, we asked the service desk agent if we would be able to board our original flight to New York since we would have two hours to do so. The service desk agents were not compassionate with their responses and told us that we can board the original flight if we would not like to see our luggage. They gave us flimsy excuses and said it would take more than two hours to transfer our bags from one plane to another and that Avianca would not take responsibility due to high air traffic.  We were not offered meal vouchers for the extra ten hours we would be stuck in the airport.",0
"Delhi to Kuala Lumpur. I would like to applaud the staff at the check in counter at the new Delhi airport for Air Asia. Two gentlemen in particular provided an excellent customer service in what could have become an issue for us and caused us major delays. They took extra initiative, made phone calls and assured us that the problem would be resolved soon. By keeping us in the loop and ensuring we made our next connecting flight on time. Thank you.",1
"Melbourne to Sydney. Domestic business class flying at its absolute finest. An internationally configured A330 with lie flat beds for a 1 hour 20 minute flight, a very tasty roast chicken dinner with some fine red wine to accompany it. Best of all a Cabin Manager and crew who were highly engaged with passengers, delivering top class service with a smile and very good humour. After a very early start to the day and a long day of meetings, just what you need for the trip home. A brilliant flight all round.",1
"As a Marco Polo member for many years I have never experienced such service from Cathay before. As frequent flyer this is the worst ever situation that happened, frankly it's just a minor request. I just wanted a cup of hot water after many hours of Flying, the male staff refused my request replying that he was too busy. Inside I was fuming but didn't want to make a scene on flight so returned to my seat without anything.",0
Baltimore to Bristol via Reykjavik. I arrived in Reykjavik from Baltimore and my connecting flight was not on the departure board. When I went to the desk I was advised the flight had been delayed for 9 hours. No explanation was offered and absolutely no sincerity. After my trip I submitted a claim and 6 months later Wow Air have yet to respond. The claim ticket just shows as open. This is the worst customer service I have ever experienced from an airline and I will never travel with them again.,0
"Everything went well. The flight was on time departing and arrived 10 minutes early. Ground staff and flight crew were all charming. Flight almost full and several cabin bags ended up in the hold, but all passengers affected seemed to be content about the arrangement as they did not have to pay extra. Most noticeable that several passengers also brought more than their cabin bag allowance on board, both in number of bags and in the size of some of them. Some bags removed to the hold were too large for the overhead lockers. I have never yet had any problems with Ryanair, their service or their website. I have always found the website clear and easy to use, and I am not very computer literate. I have used this route with Ryanair ever since it started operating from Stansted to Carcassonne many years ago, and on only two occasions has anything gone wrong, and on both occasions, the weather caused diversion to another local airport. In both cases, busses were laid on within an hour to ferry passengers between the two airports. When I read some of the complaints on this site, I really wonder what is expected of a low cost no frills airline.",1
"Great flight with Wizz Air. Plane took off on time and landed early. Cabin crew pleasant and helpful. Drinks and snacks reasonably priced and no hard sell, common with other low cost carriers. Decent leg room and seat comfort. Would not hesitate to use again.",1
Melbourne to Vancouver via Guangzhou. Our luggage was booked all the way without a hitch. We had a complimentary hotel in Guangzhou which was really good. The staff on ground and inflight were friendly and efficient. The food was good with a Chinese flavour and the inflight entertainment had a wide selection of current movies. The toilets were cleaned regularly which was a bonus as they can get pretty disgusting on long flights but not with China Southern. We have flown with the previously and will do so again.,1
"Flew on Business class with Qatar from Athens to Tokyo Haneda via Doha. First leg of the flight was on a A320 with the old layout of business class seats which are the worst from what Qatar has to offer as they don't go into bed mode and aren't as nice as the newer ones, but it was ok for a 4.5 hour flight. Service was good and so was the food offered. On the second leg of the flight we flew on the Boeing 787. Indeed a spectacular aircraft with great layout, vey comfortable seats. The amenities given along with slippers, and pyjamas were top quality. The staff were very attentive and again everything was perfect from start to finish, Can't fault it.",1
"American Airlines gave away our 3 first class seats on Flight 53 from MIA to DFW on Sunday April 13 despite the fact that we were at the gate 17 minutes before flight time. The agent had already left the with the standby passengers. This caused us to miss our connecting flight to AMA and to have to overnight at DFW. Also one of our party had to fly coach even though we purchased a first class seat. I used to worry that with the merger AA 's customer service would sink to U.S. Airs level. Now I'm afraid the ""new American Airlines"" will sink to an even lower level. They sent our luggage on to our final destination. I have lifetime Platinum status on AA for having flown over 2.2 million miles with them.",0
"Our evening flight from Orlando to New Jersey was rerouted to Philadelphia. Upon arriving we discovered that Frontier didn't have any contingency plans in place for us. This left us all having to fend for ourselves in an empty airport at one o'clock in the morning. After several attempts to get a rental car, we had to hire an Uber to get us back to New Jersey.",0
"Buy the insurance. If your travel plans are canceled due to a global pandemic, you will not receive a refund and you must use your travel credit within 90 days. Works out great when your original plans are postponed a year. The customer service reps are rude and will refuse to let you speak with a supervisor.",0
"Buenos Aires to London. We flew overnight Friday 9th November. The plane seating is worn out and uncomfortable, there were large numbers or Argentinian passengers on the plane yet I saw no staff that spoke Spanish. The chicken dinner was described as Curry but there was no sauce on it. The bread roll was stale and dessert stodgy, During the night no water was offered to me. It was not possible to charge electronic equipment, the seatback screens were small with a limited choice of entertainment.",0
"LATAM has been absolutely terrible in every way, we flew from Vancouver BC Canada to Puerto Vallarta and missed our flight due to a cancellation in Mexico city, LATAM cancelled our flight to Santiago Chile on Dec 21 and not a soul in the airport working at LATAM, we had to stay in Mexico city at our own cost in a hotel until they got us a connecting flight on the 24 of Dec. Our return trip from Santiago Chile was no different. We arrived at Mexico city airport to find out our connecting flight to YVR Vancouver had been cancelled, and yet again not one person working for LATAM in the airport was available to help us. Aeromexico was able to book us a flight home to Vancouver BC. LATAM has done nothing to help us besides cost us money in hotel stays, food and phone calls to LATAM trying to get some help. Absolute nightmare. I strongly suggest not flying with LATAM as they have caused my wife and I nothing but problems.",0
"My flight was cancelled by them in April 2020, I asked for a refund in August 2020, it is now the end of February 2021 and they still have not given me back my money despite asking for the money at least 10 times. If you book with Turkish Airlines, just realise that if the flight is cancelled, they will not give your money back for perhaps a year.",0
"17 B Aisle side Window seat, usual Emirates Business class seat. Crew on this occasion very friendly and efficient and knew what they were doing as I have had flights with very hit and miss service. Daytime inbound flight food good and entertainment very good. Full flight but very comfortable. The one disappointment was the foot well is not as long as the A,E,F and K seats and when 6'4"" you really notice the difference. On this flight I would always try for another seat but it was full when I booked. All in all very good flight and would recommend.",1
Air Asia cancelled my flights 3 times and refused to refund me after 6 months and offer me credits. By refusing to refund customers for cancelled flights is as good as cheating customers of their money.,0
"Overall, a pleasant flight. The mini croissant served on the E190 was tasty. As for the food on the A350, it was satisfying enough but was not up to my expectations. Flight attendants were smiling.",1
Memphis to Denver. The Memphis United gate agents and managers have awful attitudes and lack professionalism. The manager on duty was one of the rudest people I have ever met.,0
My wife and I flew with our 12 month old son from London to Jo'Burg on an overnight and thanks to the wonderful staff it was a brilliant experience They allocated us the whole centre row so our son could lay down to sleep and we're very attentive throughout in regards to his milk. The food for adults was great as were the drinks All in all highly recommended.,1
"Cape Town to Johannesburg with FlySafair. Fairly new in the market for internal routes. Half the price of rival Kulula and as good if not better. Very easy and quick web booking and online check in. Great staff and service. No long winded announcements on turning electronic equipment off. Quick, easy, on time, efficient, pleasant experience. ",1
"Flew Larnaca to Manchester on the 25th July. Excellent flight, arrived in Manchester early after a perfect flight. All crew pleasant and attentive. Food on board was very good also the in flight entertainment. Have flown Cobalt several times and will continue to do so when travelling to Cyprus.",1
Manchester to Geneva. Shocking. This is the 3rd time. I have flow with Easyjet and the third time I have been delayed. This flight was delayed by 90 minutes because the wing had to be deiced. Shocking quality of service.,0
"Dublin to London City on 2nd November flight was cancelled due to fog, queued for 3 hours for a rebooking only to be offered a flight on the following evening when fog was due again in London. Refund could not be processed by staff in the airport so I had to phone the call centre. Two weeks later and I still have not received a refund. Booked Ryanair for the following day and even though it was last minute, it was still cheaper than my original cancelled BA flight. Reluctant to pay a premium to fly British Airways again.",0
Worst customer service I've ever experienced from an airline. I would never fly frontier again even if I was paid to do so. Baggage check was confusing and the person behind the counter was extremely rude. Would never recommend flying this airline to anyone.,0
"We were travelling back to Johannesburg after a vacation in the Maldives when my husband suddenly lost consciousness after about 90 minutes in the air. The cabin crew were outstanding. They found a Doctor on the flight, brought the oxygen, helped administer the oxygen, calmed the family down and were caring and kind for 2 hours. When we landed in the Seychelles, an ambulance was on the runway and the excellent Sara Chang Pen, Guest Service Agent for Air Seychelles, took over. She accompanied us to the hospital and negotiated our admission and treatment there, staying with us for several hours until he was well enough to be discharged. She also booked us into a hotel, organized our passports to be stamped, sent our luggage to the hotel and ensured we were booked on the earliest flight home 3 days later. I do not believe that we could have had better service on any other airline and we are truly grateful for their excellent service.",1
"Flight from Atlantic City to Ft Lauderdale was fine. Coming home was a completely different story. We arrived at the airport 6 hours prior to our flight because we were returning from a cruise ship. The airport was a total nightmare. I had to print our boarding passes at the kiosk but at 8.50am it showed my 2.50pm flight was already delayed until 4.36pm. No real reason since there was no weather between Florida and New Jersey. Then we had to get in the ""fast bag drop"" lane and wait 45 minutes. I think they need to reread the dictionary to determine the meaning of fast. The entire time we were waiting for our flight the boards at the airport continued to show our flight was ""on time."" They cancelled another flight and didn't update that one either. We were leaving out of the same gate and around take off time I saw multiple people for the cancelled flight going up wondering what was going on with their flight. Yet their website was updated. So why the lack of communication with the airport? We were getting ready to board and of course they're oversold and need 2 volunteers fast forward a few minutes and we're on the plane and ""boarding is complete."" Then a flight attendant comes on and says they need one person to give up their seat. 20 minutes later and after the passengers are all getting antsy a different one comes on and says they need someone to give up their seat. Some good Samaritan finally gives up her seat it was ridiculous that we were held hostage so some woman could get a seat that was rightfully someone else's. Never again.",0
"Booked a flight from London to Adelaide, transiting through Abu Dhabi and Melbourne. A couple of days after I booked and paid for flight, they wrote to me claiming that due to Australian Government caps on 'unvaccinated' passengers, they would not allow me to board the flight. They said that I could instead fly from Abu Dhabi to Melbourne the day before. That's great geniuses, but what about the legs from London to Abu Dhabi and from Melbourne to Adelaide?  I asked Etihad this simple question twice  and twice they failed to answer. I cancelled the flight in disgust, requested a refund and rebooked with Singapore Airlines, who flew me the same day I was originally scheduled to fly. You know, the same day Etihad insisted I could not fly due to Australian government limits. When I cancelled the flight via Expedia, I was informed Etihad would be deducting a cancellation fee from the refund, even though it Etihad who cancelled my original flight and failed to provide me with a valid alternative! So now I have to pursue them for the cost of the cancellation fee. Etihad are a disgrace.",0
"Montego Bay to Toronto. Traveled hundreds of times. My last flight with Sunwing was by far the worst experience. Arrived in Toronto April 15. Today is April 27 and still no word on where my luggage is. The issues with mother nature is understandable, but the service since has been disgusting. This organization is a disaster.",0
"Booked a flight almost 3 months in advance using money from our travel bank. Received an email stating both the departure and return flights had changed which did not work out so selected the ""cancel and request refund"" option and now can't find the travel bank credit returned and worse yet can't even find a record of the flight when signed in to account. No record in transactions list and entering the flight booking number nothing is found. It is as if it all disappeared including the money that was originally spent on the flight. Have sat on hold for 5 hours now and nobody answers the phone. This company went from a great airline that thrived on customer service to a bottom of the barrel disaster that has horrible customer service and support. The website is a mess that you struggle to navigate as well. I think I might be done with them this time.",0
Travelled from Kolkata to London Heathrow via Mumbai and appalled by the lack of customer service rude staff who constantly bumped into me on the aisle without apologising one of my 2 bags left in Mumbai. Overall just a very poor level of service.,0
My flight to Colorado Springs with connection at Denver was delayed which in turn made me miss my connection flight. They showed no empathy towards my situation but were rude in suggesting that the only option was to fly the next day at 8 am. We were told that they were holding flights when in fact my connection flight left 7 minutes earlier than suppose to. This is the last time I fly Frontier. I was told by another flyer that this happens way to frequent and he was driving from Denver to Colorado Springs. This was my first time flying alone to this airport. They have made this a bad experience. This airline needs to get their act together.,0
Frankfurt Hahn to Lviv. When I bought my tickets online a Wizz Club was offered for a fee. I did not check the box that I wanted that club and it didn't show up on my bill before I hit purchase. Then I was charged for it. Tried to contact Wizz to get my money back. No one would help me. I never intend on flying Wizz again. Was treated horribly by Wizz staff in Lviv. I was charged excess baggage in Lviv for a bag that was fine to fly from Frankfurt with at no extra charge. It's theft and extortion. Flights attendants from Lviv were rude. Ground crew spotted throwing bags around. The food on board is expensive and tastes horrible.,0
Flew from Leeds Bradford to Lanzerote inbound and outbound flights. On time staff excellent friendly and efficient. Flown to several destinations previously and always excellent value. All seats are now allocated so don't know why people moan about a free for all. Don't know what some people expect for the money if you have the correct docs get there on time and your cases and baggage are within the stated limits then you will not have a problem if they are not then it is your own fault and you should double check your paperwork.,1
"When you attempt to use the online portal to check in and it is down, the error message advises you to call into their reservations department. The reservations department, while kind and responsive, has not actually been provided the tools to actually check someone into their flight. They simply advise you that the best thing to do is to screenshot the error message to try to prove that you checked in online so that you are not charged at the counter, as you are charged an extra fee to use the Spirit Airlines services at the airport. This lack of functionality is absolutely absurd, because instead of checking in and walking straight to security, you are forced to wait in the crowd of people that it has also failed for and then fight to not be charged at the counter.",0
"Yesterday my husband and I decided to to come home from Rome earlier than the scheduled time at 8pm. When I rang BA in London, the customer service adviser was helpful and reassuring and able to change the the flight time to 3pm without having to pay extra. Onboard the flight, the steward gave me hot water and milk so that I can used my own preferred decaf tea and did not charge me. While waiting to get off the plane, I had a wonderful conversation with the BA staff who are so pleasant. I love flying with BA and we will continue to do so. We have booked our flight with BA next year. Thank you for taking good care of us and just to sat how much we appreciate your excellent service.",1
Every flight I was booked on today was late or canceled. I am sure the airlines would say not our fault but it was late planes. Mechanical failures that blocked gates. First officers that don't show up and scratches on the bottoms of wings that mysteriously grow while the FO can't be located. Two guys booked on the flight decided to drive to Indy because it would be faster than flying. Not a ringing endorsement.,0
This airline is engaged in unethical behavior. The Loganair flight I booked was canceled by Loganair. Loganair refuses to refund me the money I paid for the booking. Do not book a flight on Loganair under any conditions,0
"By far the worst experience I have had with an airline. Flying United Airlines from Melbourne to Mexico through LAX, the flights were delayed for 6 hours. Had a similar experience on the way back and United lost our luggage! The customer service is rude and unhelpful. While waiting in the long line for customer service at LAX I overheard one of United's customer service agents joking about how she directed one customer to take the long way around the airport to intentionally cause him grief. My advice is to do anything you can to avoid flying with United Airlines. The small amount of money you may save with them is not worth the trauma. This is an airline offering the poorest quality service they can get away with.",0
"Mumbai to Muscat. Got two days delay in receiving luggage, no customer care, just list of phone numbers. No response on mails, took two power banks to add it to the luggage, not added and lost.  Very very bad experience, never travel with GoAir.",0
"London City to Zurich, I fly this route a lot, around 8 times per year, The flight was delayed initially by an hour, I was kept up to date via the app so I was not disappointed. Around 45 minutes into the flight one of the crew member came over with a card in his hands wishing me a Happy Birthday followed by a bottle of Champagne, Brandy etc, this was totally unexpected, it made my day. Thanks to the crew.",1
Traveled YYT to MBJ for holiday. The YYT to YYZ leg was Air Canada main YYZ to MBJ was Rouge. After reading the many complaints about Rouge service I was on the lookout for problems but did not find any. Excellent service on both trips with a very attentive cabin crew. On the return leg from YYZ to YYT we were unable to land due to fog and had to return to YUL arriving at 2.30 am. Air Canada gate agents met us in the terminal with hotel and meal vouchers and informed us that a new flight for us would be departing at 9am and we received our luggage quickly. We opted to not got to the hotel as it would be a short stay so we checked back in and waited in the Maple Leaf Lounge. We reported for boarding at 8.30am but were informed that due to weather at YYT we would be delayed until 11.30am. Air Canada agents handed out meal vouchers and we returned to the lounge. Flight departed at 11.30am and we arrived YYT without incident. Overall it was a great experience and we would definitely fly Air Canada again. The delays were unavoidable as no airline controls the weather but we felt that Air Canada did everything they could to keep us informed and comfortable throughout. I should add that we were loyal Westjet customers until this year and harboured a dislike of Air Canada before this trip but we have definitely changed our opinion.,1
Guwahati to Delhi. We get it its a budget airline. But if the flight is getting delayed then you should let the passengers know about the delay beforehand and not 1 hour before the flight.,0
Just arrived back to Heathrow from Malta. Everything went like clockwork very attentive friendly cabin crew great in flight food free newspaper. Recommend flying with Air Malta every time beats the competition.,1
Delhi to New York. Worst airline ever. We had to make an emergency landing at another airport and through incompetence and negligence waited 4 hours at another airport without food or water. Their mistakes made everyone miss their connecting flights which they refused to hold even though it affected hundreds of passengers. We waited over three hours at New Delhi airport just to get new boarding passes for flights 24 hours later.  All because they refused to pay another airline. No food or water for another 4 hours before forcing us to share airport hotel rooms with complete strangers. They refused to tell us what was going on which created chaos and much longer waits for everything. I now have to spend at least another additional 30 hours of traveling just to get home. Do not fly this airline!! It is not safe and you are treated like garbage with no customer service whatsoever.,0
"I booked my flight from Anchorage to Pittsburgh 4 months in advance. We picked the specific dates and times based upon having multiple children including a baby and to be able to make a family reunion. United turned around and changed our flight to only give us a 4 hour layover from a 1.5 hours, they also made us miss our family reunion. On top of that they changed our flight home to go from having our flight be 5 hours to almost 10. They had no empathy, had nothing to offer and was not willing to give me any type of compensation. This is the second incident that have encountered with them. My recommendation would be to never fly with United.",0
Los Angeles to Amsterdam via Keflavik. A great flight with an outstanding crew. This has been my best transatlantic flight. Shout out to the entire crew. Made the 9 hour flight seem like 30 minutes.,1
Flight 63 July 4 2014. We had a full coach with no functioning bathrooms! I found out from one of the FA's that the flight came to Madrid from Washington with the forward bathroom already broken and the service crew didn't bother to fix it. Mid flight the second bathroom got irreparably jammed because of over use and lack of water. Of the last one soon followed. What sort of management runs a company like that. United will soon have the reputation that Aeroflot had back in the eighties. We will never travel with United again and that after twenty years of loyalty.,0
I booked Iberia for a family holiday to South Africa to visit family. Booked the flights nearly a year in advance to get the best prices. When I phoned to add a new born baby to the booking a number of months later I discovered that the flight time for the first leg had changed so I didn't have time to transfer for the second leg. Iberia were offering a full refund. But a refund is no good as then you have no flight. And as months had passed the prices on all airlines had increased. I had no choice but to accept the refund and pay extra to book flights with another airline. Or cancel the trip. I have since heard of other people having similar problems with Iberia on long haul routes. Where parts of the journey are cancelled close to the departure date and Iberia just shrug and offer a refund leaving people with no flights to where they are going. I would never ever risk booking them again for a long haul flight.,0
Abbotsford to Edmonton with Flair Airlines. Worst customer service possible. Repeatedly lied to about delays. Five hours late and nobody cares. Standard operating procedure for this joke of an airline. Never again.,0
This is the first time I am travelling from Air India Express from Dubai to New Delhi and my first experience is bad. Firstly the flight is delayed by 2 hrs. All the crew members are talking to the passengers in Hindi. Even though my mother tongue is hindi this is really unprofessional. Flight looks very old.  My seat number is 31F. I will try to choose Air India express as my last option. I guess Air India should get privatised now.,0
"Bangkok to Delhi. I cannot believe Air India is still a real airline. Starting from the attitude of the cabin crew to the service, it was all downhill. Non vegetarian food finished before reaching our seat. We opted for vegetarian instead but apparently that was over too. Finally settled with one extra croissant. The cabin crew looked unhappy. I'm sure they have their issues with the airline but it should not snowball onto the customers.",0
"Excellent flight from Guatemala City to Flores and back with TAG Airlines. First flight was a Embraer, second was a Saab 340. Very nice, smooth flight. On the first flight a small snack box was given, on the flight back a soda, chips and cookies were given.",1
Funchal to Lisbon. I paid 411 euros for two domestic one hour and twenty minutes flights and was allocated a seat in the middle at the very rear of the aircraft. Through the flight I heard the crew chatting at the galley. Flight departed and landed on time.,0
"Oklahoma City to Chicago. My flight was delayed multiple times and their customer service sucks . The staff needs better training as they do not know what they are talking about. It took the 5th rep to be able to tell me the true answer to my issue after being told and promised something different. They do not honor what they say. Make sure you get it in writing because all you will get is a ""I'm sorry this is policy. We will address this internally."" I wasted 4 hours on the phone with them.",0
I was impressed with both flights. The Edinburgh to Amsterdam leg was comfortable and the cabin crew extremely professional. The flight to Dammam was also excellent. The seating was comfortable and I had ample leg room. The food and inflight entertainment was great too.,1
"I have been flying with Volotea for many years to return to my hometown. Volotea is flexible in changes, has special offers for its customers. Even during the pandemic, it ensured flights and refunds in the event of cancellation. Comfortable planes and luggage included up to some limits.",1
"Flew with British Airways for the first time from Sydney to London return. Very unsatisfactory compared to premium economy experiences with other airlines. Had to pay to preselect seats and not only was there no priority boarding, the World Traveller Plus customers in fact were the last to board. There were only 6 rows of premier economy, yet was told that the meal choice has ran out. The meal took me back to air travel in the 1970s. The starter consisted of 6 tasteless pasta spiral and 1 cherry tomato. The fish was dry and tasteless and the rice an unappetising grey colour. The dessert was a square of plain cheesecake. Hot beverages at breakfast were served in thin paper cups. There was no other service, no offer of water or snacks between the meals. Toiletry consisted of hand wash and nothing else. The toilets were not cleaned and replenished during the stop over in Singapore. The seat was comfortable enough but has only a foot rest rather than the leg rest of other airlines. BA World Traveller Plus is certainly not value for money and I will not travel with them again.",0
Normally I have a very good experience with Vistara ground staff and in flight staff.However my experience was terrible with a ground staff when I flew Delhi to Hyderabad. She seemed to be rude and didn't bother to patiently listen. She was rude with other passengers.,0
"Guwahati to Delhi. The flight arrival was not on time, they said there are weather issues as reason for delay which there was not. Normal weather outside at time of landing, booked cabs missed, reached home late, was veryhungry and tired. I requested a window seat but they denied that as well.",0
My wife and I flew from Bournemouth to Ibiza 24th September returning to Bournemouth on the 1st October 2013. Clean aircraft on both occasions. Very good cabin crews happy and anxious to please. Both flights ahead of arrival times. On the inward flight the Captain saw the majority of passengers using the front steps off the aircraft with a happy word for all. Stop moaning about Ryanair. Stick to the rules and you will enjoy the experience.,1
One of the worst airlines I have used. The website is difficult to use and I had issue to obtain my boarding pass. I went to the airport and even the staff didn't know what was going on and how to sort it. They had to call a superior staff to sort my boarding pass problem. I tried by phone and chat.  It seems when people comment about the problem they had with them they block.  I wouldn't recommend it at all,0
"I was traveling to Minneapolis. Our band leader booked Spirit because it was the cheapest option. From the moment we arrived we realized it was a bad idea. First, You have to check in and create a profile on their stupid website just to not be charged a fee when you get to the airport for a boarding pass. Then, they charge for any carry on bags whatsoever. Our first flight to Minneapolis was delayed over an hour. All refreshments have to be paid for. Then the morning we were supposed to head back home. We kept getting notices that our flight was delayed, it started around an hour until a flight that was supposed to leave around 6pm wasn't going to leave until midnight. Then, the flight was finally cancelled with no explanation whatsoever. We spent the whole day trying to call and get answers but no one could tell us anything. Finally we had to go all the way to the airport to get some answers. All they could tell us was that the flight was cancelled due to ""circumstances beyond their control"", and the only flight they could now put us on wouldn't leave until Sunday. This was a flight that supposed to leave on Friday night. Luckily, my friends had already called ahead and booked whatever flight they could that was left on Saturday, but that flight wouldn't get us to our destination until midnight on Saturday. They offered us nothing for our troubles, the only thing they ended up giving us was a voucher for half off a hotel. I will never fly Spirit Airlines again.",0
Regina to Toronto. Worst customer service. I will never recommend Westjet to anyone. Customer service just try to disrespect you because you have a economy class. Pathetic service. Try to put blame on customer so other flight can be booked. Shout at customer and give no solution.,0
Brisbane to Hong Kong QF97 Business Class. New fit out in Business class really nice layout comfortable seat and easily folds out into fully flat bed. Great IFE on large new screen. Overall a much better product by a long way compared to old Qantas Business class.,1
"Chicago to Madrid with Iberia business class. Excellent service, nice design of Business cabin and seats. Food is below average though. Decent amenity kit. Limited internet usage for free. Nice shower and breakfast upon arrival at the arrival lounge at Barajas airport of Madrid. I would definitely fly again.",1
"Worst customer service ever.  No phone number to call. My flight got cancelled, no help, no refund. Unbelievable",0
Delhi to Ahmedabad. The crew assisted me in putting my luggage without asking. A seat was a little wet and crew Deepika and Dimi made sure to make the seat comfortable. They served the food with care and delivered well in time. Congratulations for showing such dedicated approach towards work.,1
Portland to Denver. Very disappointed in United Airlines! Flight delay almost 3 hours due to mechanical issues on outbound flight from DIA which resulted in loosing half a day in Denver area! Why would United not book us on the next available flight when there were still seats available? Why don't they have another plane available? Denver is a main hub and this is ridiculous when it's from the originating airport. United has offered no compensations.,0
Really impressed with the service. Planes are really small but it's a full service and the attendants are lovely. Edinburgh to Copenhagen and back. Flights were on time and smooth. No inflight entertainment. No issue though as its less than 2 hours. Website does says online check in which isn't true so it is old fashioned counter check in. They are sorting that though.,1
"The worst airline to fly. From lost luggage and when returned weeks later, my bags were damaged. No apology. Still waiting for my refund for the toiletries and clothes I had to purchase.",0
"It was a pleasant and comfortable flight depart from Kuala Lumpur to Seoul via Ho Chi Minh. Attentive and efficient flight crew, good quality of meals with added some local delight and the latest A350 aircraft. I like their color theme of the seat. The aircraft was fascinating with larger screen and more leg room. The content selection was decent and more than enough throughout the flight. I was also on their A321 during my KUL to SGN. Although the aircraft looks bit old but well maintained and comfortable. They used three different language during flight announcement and it was not clear and blur. This was my first time fly with and I'm quite impressed with their product and services provided with that competitive price.",1
My wife and I flew premium class to Cancun leaving Jan 11th and returning Jan 25th. The flights were very enjoyable and the service very good. The premium cabin is excellent value. As others have noted the seating can be a problem. On the outward journey we had the silly seats which make it difficult for someone in the window seat to get. Apparently these seats are being phased out. Cancun is a busy airport and there was a long wait for one of our suitcases not the fault of the airline. We also booked the Aspire lounge at Gatwick. This wasn't bad but the carpets and seats were shabby and stained.,1
"Flew London via Kuala Lumpur on the A380, we received amazing service on the twelve and a half hour flight, the cabin crew were attentive, smiley and prompt in their service and the food and drink were really lovely. the cabin and toilets were kept clean on the journey and the lay flat beds were comfortable even for me at 6ft 2. We received equally good service on the other three flights, particularly from Bali to Kuala Lumpur on the 14th September who despite a packed cabin it was exceptional service for us and our fellow travelers. My wife and I would have absolutely no trouble in recommending this airline, well done Malaysian.",1
We flew from Brussels to NYC and it was a very unpleasant trip. The attendant was unprofessional and little help and assistance was given to families. Myself and young child sat at the front while my husband sat at the front. There are many airlines that flight this route and have choices. Little entertainment for young children. We were in transit and not enough time to get to our gate. I would not recommend to family and friends.,0
"Horrible Customer Service. My husband and I went to Jamaica out of Tampa. Upon our return flight our flight was delayed for over 8 hours. We were given vouchers for food at the airport, flight credit and a hotel stay. We were told they will provide transportation to the hotel since we were getting back late. Long story short there were over 100 people waiting for transportation and they only sent 1 van for a total of 12 passengers. Southwest left us stranded at the hotel, we filed a complaint, was told wrong department and never got a follow up. This company just takes your money, gives false information and points the finger at everyone else and don't care about their customers. I would not recommend them to anyone.",0
This is easily the worst experience I've ever had. 2 hours before our flight at 10 at night I received an email saying your flight I'd canceled till the next day. I couldn't get anybody on the phone. They wouldn't accommodate me at all. We had to sleep on the floor in the airport. Then flying home They did the same thing!!!! Again with 0 accountability or doing anything to rectify the situation. I will never fly Delta again.  Worst airline ever.,0
We travelled from Barbados to Manchester in December Boeing 747 Pretty Woman. The flight was on time the aircraft seats were comfortable and the inflight entertainment was good. The flight crew were hard working and pleasant. The flight was spoilt by someone a little worse for drink who then starting abusing his partner and the cabin crew. This was dealt with very well by the staff in very difficult circumstances. The man was arrested at Manchester. We felt very sympathetic with the flight crew because they were only doing their job and did not deserve the abuse. We have used Virgin quite a few times in the past few years and always enjoy their flights.,1
"Couple hundred feet before landing pilot pulls up hard to abandoned the landing. We reach maybe a thousand feet and being so low the plane is shaking. No one is communicating to us. It was terrifying. Later when the pilot finaly did talk with the passengers he spoke of a wind shift making us unable to land ... just saying some earlier communication would have appreciated. People were crying and praying, yelling requesting info, it was just a lot for a ""wind shift"".",0
"Cebu to Manila on 16th March. More than 75 minutes delay and add to the delay with ferrying passengers by bus. No timely or accurate information about the delay. At one point the announcement was that our aircraft had not yet departed from its originating Airport, it took a passenger and his app to show the ground staff that the plane was actually half way already.",0
"EasyJet have no customer service.  I was at the airport early. I had already checked in and all I needed to do was a baggage drop. I was good for time and then EasyJet staff were calling for people to come forward first for the Faroe islands and then for Copenhagen, which allowed them to skip the line and go ahead of me and other passengers. I subsequently missed my flight to Tel Aviv and now have booked with KLM for that evening. EasyJet customer service has been a disgrace to deal with and I wish that after 2 calls to your call centre and emails I was given zero customer support.",0
"London Heathrow to Toronto. It was an awesome flight with Air Canada because when I checked in, my seat was originally 21H but the lady at the airport changed my seat to 21K which is the window seat and I sat next to the wing.  When I boarded, I went to meet the pilot and they were such gentlemen. It was also been such a long time I took a 777 Flight. Always go for the engine seat on the 777!",1
Good food but nothing else. A 2 hour delay which made us miss our connecting flight. Being with a different airline Tarom did not want to take any responsibility for us missing our connection. We had to wait 24 hours for new seats and pay new tickets in full. Tarom staff was rude and arrogant at both airports whenever we went to them to voice our concerns and complaints. A supervisor did not even want to speak with us. We were stranded in a foreign country with no money left from our vacation and Tarom employees refused to even listen to us.,0
"I always enjoy flying Tigerair Australia on this short 35 minute flight, the fares are always great and I find the A320 a nice aircraft. Service generally good and never encountered any delays with this service. Tiger should consider flying the route more than 3 times a week as my flights have always been full. ",1
"Proserpine to Brisbane. Not a great experience at all! I'll start with the rude, abrupt and ignorant staff who checked us in at Proserpine. Tried telling us we were over weight and needed to pay extra, however upon her looking after I told her we both had 30kg allowance she realised I was correct. No apology. My partner's case had been damaged on our travels which we told her about. She  threw a pen and paper for him to declare this then snatched it back off him! Totally rude with zero custom service and facial expressions show signs that she hates her job! Clearly not the job for her being in a customer service role. To note I wasn't the only person who I heard complain about her neither. When we got on the plane, staff never smiled. They are meant to make going on holiday a nice experience which wasn't my experience with . I have coeliac disease so asked for a GF alternative to the snack given. I was told by staff they would check but I'm still waiting now! I had to ask again if I could purchase crisps but they had practically ran out of all stock. Wont look to travel with Virgin Australia again or recommend  to anyone.",0
2 hour delays with one hour waiting on them to do paperwork. 5 airplanes errors. Please spend the extra money not to ride. A slow crew of unprofessional people. They turned the computers on the airplane on and off two times. Sat in darkness with no AC for 15 min. Now waiting 20 or more mins for paperwork to clear them of their bad customer service. Will never fly Frontier again.,0
Finnair is a great airline. Flew from Berlin to Helsinki. They offer a very pleasant business class product even for European flights. It is almost like the old days when flying was fun. The staff on this flight looked like they liked what they did. You had the feeling that you were appreciated and not only an annoyance. The food was tasty and the wine was more than ok.,1
"Belgrade to Brussels via Zurich. Flying with Swiss is very comfortable. From first flight from Belgrade to Zurich, the plane was late. Same aircraft was A220, and it is so comfortable. The snack and drinks was served and Swiss chocolate. Because of the late we almost missed our connection flight from Zurich to Brussel but we manage, but later we have to change the airplane, the reason was that the A3230 has some problems. We take off more than one hour late with new airplane. The flight was quiet and even that we come late to Brussels the Swiss make journey nice. I would fly with them again in future and thank you Swiss.",1
"Cork to Moscow via Paris. Delayed flights on both trips, ended up missing a connecting flight as a result. Appalling service on the ground in the airport. Luggage severely delayed despite being promised it would be put on my new flight with me. Absolute disaster.",0
"Buffalo to Fort Myers. Frontier is a horrible airline and would not recommend to anyone. Customer service is awful. At the end of a flight they pitch a rewards program to you through a credit card. I had to call 5 times for someone to even help, they then said they are not knowledgeable on the rewards program before telling me I must be confused regarding their promotion and then they even withheld miles I earned with my early returns number. Just a horrible airline and I would fly into an airport farther away just to avoid them in the future.",0
LH 411 2 March. My seat was in the first row on the aisle. Due to the service it was not possible to stretch my legs for a long period of time. After the flight I still had pain in my back. The onboard service was not very satisfying and the meal served was not really edible.,0
"Bogota to Pereira. I was charged as much as the ticket cost because my 5kg backpack was 5cm too tall. It ended up fitting perfectly fine in length in the baggage bins, I have travelled all over the world with this same backpack on many different low cost airlines. For me this feels like a scam.",0
"Manila to Toronto via Shanghai. Worst airline ever. Was flying from Manila to Toronto via Shanghai with my wife and two kids. The flight was first and then diverted to a different airport due smog. That's when the nightmare started. We're not allowed to deplane for more than two hours due to lack of ground staff. Eventually upon disembarking, the ground staff said we will be transferred to the main airport in a shuttle bus for the connecting flight. We were kept waiting for the bus for more than 4 hrs without any proper explanation. It was hard to communicate with them and the staff was rude. Eventually when we reached the main airport, we were told the flight has left and there are no seats until the day after. Again no proper explanation. They transferred to a very crappy hotel faraway from the airport. We were stuck for two in this hotel with kids without proper food and staff that does not understand a word of English. Finally upon checking in for the two days later, the staff refused point blank to accommodate our food request. We survived on buns for 14 hrs. They were even rude when we tried to explain our dietary requirements. Kids fell sick. Never flying this airline again. I would give it a big zero.",0
Horrible customer service. I didn't pick up the rental thru them due to me losing my license the day before and they won't refund me. I called Alamo and they said they cant refund that Allegiant have to but they mention they wont refund you due to them still trying to make money through a rental. But I didn't use it?,0
"Los Angeles to Charlotte. Unreliable with a poor customer service. Our flight got cancelled due to technical problem, we were booked to a stop flights which first flight was delayed so you would arrive 30 minutes after your connection had left but they didn't care and have us a boarding pass to fool us. By looking at monitors we realized what was going on, one more time we got to long line of customer services and after a long wait, we were booked to a over night flight to arrive next day. Meanwhile I was checking available flight on Google and there was a United leaving soon but they took so long and by misguiding us it was too late to make to the gate for boarding. There was plenty flights with Delta available but they said they have no access to that which I don't believe it. They just wanted to fill up their own flights. They never offer any voucher for food or drink and I was told to open a claim on line and they would reimburse me for expenses during 10 hours wait, I just got an email telling me they can't do that but they give me some stupid AA points which serve for nothing. Useless company.",0
"My flight got cancelled due to technical issues and they booked me another flight the next day, with a different airline. They told me that they would send my baggage to my last destination, Boston. According to my flight, I was supposed to transit in Dubai. When I got to Dubai, the customer service people let me know that Turkish airlines cancelled my ticket, a ticket they bought me because of my flight cancellation. Even worse, when I finally got to Boston, my baggage was lost. ",0
"We have been surprised by new jets for summer destinations, equipped with modern entertainment, personal ipad with a variety of programs. Quality of meal and drinks onboard is good. Service on board is excellent. Crew were very professional. I can frankly say that these flights were very pleasant for our family and we would fly with Air Astana again.",1
"Flew Berlin to London Heathrow via Zurich. Swiss has a really nice business class product for European flights. I really like connecting at Zurich. The Swiss staff are generally very pleasant. Have flown Swiss in Economy, Business and First many many times. The Swiss quality of food on these shorts is quite good. A minus is that you have really small wine glasses. If you are unlucky, they come only once. Great is their Swiss beer.",1
I flew business class on A319 from Frankfurt to Erbil and back then to Houston on A380. There was no business seats from FRA to EBL even though they passed it off as business class. Just the same as coach. It was a 4 hour flight. Absolutely dreadful! Then in business class on the A380 the seats do not go horizontal therefore I could get no sleep as my body was being pulled down.,0
Tenerife to Malaga. Very good service and no problem at all. I really like flying Norwegian! Ground Staff was really friendly as well as cabin crews and pilots. Smooth flight and nice service.,1
I am German and used to be a loyal Lufthansa customer. In general it is probably still one of the better Airlines out there but the way they treat the average customer who are just Frequent Traveler status or even less and not Senator or Hon is just plain deplorable. The way they credit now for miles flown tells me that they don't value my business at all anymore. Another annoying thing is the discrimination against carry on bag travelers who are not Gold level. I invested quite some money into a carry on to make sure that it would be in compliance size wise according to international standards and IATA approval but yet I was forced at various occasions to give it up when I was just about to board the flight. The most recent very bad experience I had was when I was just coming off the transatlantic flight from Dulles to Frankfurt and wanted to connect on the domestic flight to Berlin LH 180 on Sunday June 1st at 10.45am. The gate agent ladies serving the desk for that flight were just horrible to say the least forcing me to check my carry on bag  which I had no problem carrying on the transatlantic flight from Dulles to Frankfurt. It's one thing if there are viable reasons for that to do so but being singled out while others were walking by with two pieces of luggage was an experience of discrimination that I never wish to endure again.,0
"Booked an economy light fare which only included a very small 8kg carry on bag. I found it strange that a full service airline would even have that option but given the fare was not cheap I assumed service on board would make up for this. Boarding was slow and messy requiring passengers to queue to have their documents checked, then queue again to check our tickets, then queue again in the jet bridge. What is the point of assigning boarding groups when all but priority passengers are called to board at the same time? Seats in economy were akin to a budget airline with minimal legroom, no headrest or entertainment. Cabin was not clean, and crew handed out alcohol wipes. On both legs I took with Lufthansa there was no food or drink available, complimentary or paid. This was a 2 hour service right about lunchtime. Almost any other full service airline would have provided some sort of food service. It is already low cost carrier like to only have paid food services. To have no service at all is just pathetic for a 5 Star Airline. Crew were barely seen during the flight. To top it off the flight was delayed. Overall the flight was worse than ultra low cost carriers while charging more.",0
"Calgary to Abbotsford. The service could not be any worse. My flight was delayed 7 hours then cancelled. No other flights were available to get me to my destination in time. It was impossible to speak with an agent on the phone line. I would either get disconnected immediately, or put on hold until the call centre closes. I takes up to 4 days for them to respond to their support email messages and the responses are unintelligent form responses. No compensation for my delay or cancellation was offered. I still cannot get a refund for the ticket they cancelled. I will never fly Flair Airlines again and recommend people avoid it at all costs.",0
"Worst flight experience of my life, hands down. 7am flight was canceled and I was automatically given a 7pm option which completely flushed an entire day of my vacation down the toilet. There were problems with timing for every flight I dealt with. The last plane I was on had no air conditioning for at least 45 minutes.",0
"London Gatwick to Funchal. British Airways are still forcing people to fly to Madeira when the Foreign Office has advised against anything other than essential travel. My wife and her friend were due to fly to Madeira on 17 March for a week's holiday when we found out that the FO had advised against travelling there. The Madeira government had ruled that new arrivals would spend 14 days in quarantine no matter how long their stay, that's a week longer than their proposed stay. Her friend contacted BA but was told they could not have a refund as the flight was still on! They offered a voucher. If this is an example of BAs customer service I am not surprised they are in trouble.",0
The worst experience ever. Delays and Delays and do not forget cancellation for two days.  The sleeping in the airport due to no vacancy at hotels. The children sleeping on the floor which was cold. I do not know where to began!,0
"Lisbon to Miami. This was my third experience with TAP. Same issue every time. They have argumentative, very rude and unhappy employees, and no customer service. Their tactic is to have you check carry on luggage claiming the flight is full and there is no overhead compartment space available. I was targeted at the check in counter for having a large bag that they said would not fit in the overhead bin. I have flown with this bag many times, which is TSA carry on compliant, in many airlines including small planes. It fits perfectly in the overhead bin! Other people had larger bags than me and carried them on board. I refused to check my bag in at the ticket counter. I was harassed about the bag at the boarding gate by the gate agent. Upon boarding the aircraft and stowing away my luggage in the overhead bin, the flight attendant came over to my seat and ask to see my boarding pass and had me identify my bag that was already stowed in the overhead compartment. I was forced to check my bag in because they said there was no space even though there was still space available next to my bag.",0
"I had a business trip from Hamburg to Stockholm, I hated this flight. The cabin crew were quite nice but the flight itself was unbearable! The seats were very dirty and the floor was very sticky like someone had spilt a soda! I do not like this airline and I'm not going to fly it again! My meal was very dry, I had to drink so much with the meal to make it somewhat bearable.",0
I had an excellent experience with Aeromexico. They took care of my dietary concerns and I was aware of the baggage policy when traveling to and from South America. Agents met me with instructions concerning my bags in both directions. ,1
"Dubai to Bucharest. Worst aviation experience I have ever had. Almost two hours delay, staff is not able to provide information. Airplane entertainment does not work. I will for sure never fly with this airline again.",0
"Bangkok to Shanghai. The ticket only covers airfare, no carry on or bags,",0
"I booked SV772 from Jeddah to Mumbai. But they change it to SV 3772 without giving the option to cancel it. The airplane was pathetic. As I entered there was no AC running, the flight was by a third party. There was no crew from Saudi Airline and no one giving any answer for it. Even no one was sitting there as per their seat number. I can say the airline was cheating to their passenger by taking the money for good airplane and providing them third party third grade service. I will caution the passenger if saudi airline change the number then you should immediately cancel it.",0
"I was able to pre board onto my Southwest Airlines plane. I'm a tall guy so I headed for the emergency row. I get seated and the flight attendant angrily asks me to move, as a pre boarder I'm not allowed to sit in the emergency row. Confused, I obliged. Calm until the guy who walked in directly after me claims the extra leg room for himself. Why me specifically am I not allowed to sit there? Offended as all hell, I'll be avoiding Southwest for future flights.",0
Manado to Makassar and to Jakarta. Nothing was offered on the first leg not even a cup of water. We did not see the crew at all. On the 2nd leg only 1 cup of water given and a small selection of snacks for sale after that. Again your don't see the crew at all after distribution of items. Disembarkation through the rear exit while the stewardess stood leaning against the wall with her arms folded. The only good thing about the flight and airline was that it was on time the seating was really very cramped.,0
"Sao Paulo to Johannesburg on 2 October 2012. The cabin crew were one of the worst I have experienced. Their behaviour and conversation before we boarded was less than professional. The flight was smooth so it made me wonder why the food trolley was bumping into the passengers. There was one passenger who had requested a vegan meal when she booked and when she asked the air hostess she was told ""no we don't have any vegetarian meals"". She didn't even try to compromise which was something that could have been done.",0
"Rome to Luton return with Monarch Airlines. Outward and inward flights on time and arrived ahead of schedule. Despite a fairly full aircraft the cabin crew were efficient, polite and friendly. I ordered extra leg room seats and an inflight meal, which was of a good quality. I was most impressed by the way one stewardess managed a particularly difficult passenger who was quite rude and aggressive, and that efforts were made to juggle seating to allow a last minute couple to sit together. Monarch Airlines is every bit as good as it's larger contemporaries, just a bit friendlier!",1
Westjet is the worst airline to book flight or vacation. They cancelled flight and vacation and never returned the money. Trying to call and it is impossible to speak to representative. They put you on hold and never answering.,0
We recently tried to book a flight from Halifax to Orlando with Air Canada. Unfortunately all suitable flights were showing Rouge as the operator. We had recently had a very bad experience with Rouge due to the minimal seat space and no padding in the seats. We refused to even consider a Rouge seat. We seriously considered driving to Orlando until CAA found us direct flights with WestJet. Much more attractive than Air Canada.,0
"We flew from Dubai to Pune on the 4th and they didn't load our baggage. It's been two days without clothes or necessary items and medications and the airline is taking no responsibility, offering no solution, or any reimbursement for the inconvenience. I'm here on holiday to attend a family function and my baggages are held up. This is honestly the worst service and the worst airline.",0
"Flight booked is a return from Edmonton Alberta to Abbotsford BC. Booked in April for flight on July 8th 2019. Informed today May 26th 2019 that flight and time has been changed to a time that is not acceptable for us. Tried calling them to see.why and what can be done about this and have now been on hold for 2 hours 7 minutes and counting. Unbelievable that they treat their customers this way. Do they only have 1 person in the call center? Makes.me.wonder if they only have one pilot and.one mechanic to service their planes. Does not instill confidence in this company. Repeating message "" by now you've guessed we have higher than normal call volumes and longer wait times. Your call is important to us so please continueto hold.."" For how. long? People have limited lives you kno,  far too short to waste on service like this. I will never use Flair again.",0
Absolute train wreck of a flight. Was supposed to take off at 908 pm 30 September 2021. Didn't take off until after 2 am. Arrived at Gand Rapids at almost 5 am. So now I have to wait at the airport until the rental car place opens at 8am. Also no ride to my hotel room so lost out on that. And all they offered us was a lowsy food voucher. Yep done with this airline. I guess when they mean cheap fares that means service too.,0
"I was very pleased with the service of the cabin crew on the flight CZ325 from Guangzhou to Sydney on 6th April 2018. I was travelling with my grandma who required wheelchair assistance, and the cabin crew were very accomodating and attentive to her needs. They were also polite and helpful in all other areas. I would definitely fly with China Southern again.",1
We flew on the new Dreamliner in premium on 19th September. We normally fly BA from Gatwick but could not be bothered with the 4 hr drive down but I wish I had. The crew on both flights were poor unprofessional and quite frankly Thomson needs to sort their customer service out. The premium seat were uncomfortable and my wife who is a size 10 could not get out of the middle seat when the front seat was reclined! How in an emergency would they get out! Overall very poor and would not use again.,0
"I always find Thai AirAsia cabin crews to be efficient and friendly with a good service mind. The ground experience is from poor to fair. I need to use a wheelchair and there is little care given for people with mobility challenges.  We were kept waiting for a wheelchair in Bangkok, staff arrived with a wheelchair that was in very poor state of repair.  No wheelchair in Krabi but the distances were short enough that it was okay. The troubles at Krabi airport when there was no special desk for people who had paid for the priority service. Another passenger who was also physically challenged and I had to wait nowhere to sit until we approached the people at the desks. A wheelchair was produced and the person taking care of me was very good. When we got to the Bangkok airport after having to get on a bus that is physically challenged there was no one waiting for myself or the other passenger wheelchair. It took a significant amount of time and discussion before they came.",0
"I have being trying for the last two hours to get an answer to a Covid question and still waiting on hold. This is quite possibly the worst customer service that I have ever experienced in my 79 years of life. Absolutely astounding! I have tried their website with no success, then on to their chat which was a complete waste of time, and now I am on hold for a ""supervisor"" I eventually had to hang up as nobody had the decency nor courtesy of picking up the phone. In a nutshell ""totally disgusted"" and I am not onboard yet.",0
"New Orleans to Fort Lauderdale with Spirit Airlines, and we've flown this route often. The crew is pleasant, the fares are great and the planes are clean. We often arrive early to our destination. You have to know that you will pay for extras but we seldom desire or require much during travel.",1
Vancouver to Phuket via Seoul. Very happy with the flight. Decent food entertainment and good seat pitch for economy. Will definitely fly KA again.,1
"Took the Southwest flight 2952 from Denver to Ontario and I was lucky that I did. The stewardesses were Taylor, Melissa, and Jennifer and they were fantastic! Special shout out to Taylor, professional, but interactive and attentive. They made this flight enjoyable ... nice work Southwest!",1
"Charlotte to Los Angeles with American Airlines. I have flown on a lot of airlines, today's was the worst. Dismal customer service, rude counter workers and flight attendants, service boasted of wifi, television screens with 250 movies on the seat as well as USB chargers for the seats, none of which were available on a 5.5 hour flight. Boarding process was painful. Plane was dirty and some seats were worn out and had tears in them. Will not be flying with American Airlines again. Plane tickets are way too expensive for such substandard value.",0
Taipei to Honolulu via Tokyo in economy. All flights on time. Food OK. Plane and bathrooms clean. Entertainment not bad. Service was great at all levels. Would fly them again for this route.,1
Gatwick to Bodrum Found the fact that our row of seats seemed to move considerably quite alarming! Very cramped and the staff not very friendly. Refreshments very expensive. Return flight chaotic boarding as we were allowed to board both ends of the plane. Turkish passengers obviously more favoured! But it was cheap!,0
Cebu Pacific changed my flight time from early morning to the evening 2 days before the actual flight. Pretty much screwed our vacation. I will never fly Cebu Pacific again. Save yourselves a headache and find other carriers.,0
"Don't fly Islena in Honduras if you can fly Sosa instead. We flew Islena from San Pedro Sula to Roatan via La Ceiba. When we arrived in La Ceiba we watched our plane being towed away and were not told anything. Our 20 minute layover exceeded 2 hours. At no time were we told anything by Islena staff. There were no staff members to help us and we were restricted to a room without food or drink. Exactly one week later we were delayed in Roatan for over 3 hours without any explanation. Occasionally an announcement was made in Spanish that said the plane was coming ""soon"". We know they were lying because the flight time from La Ceiba to Roatan is only 15 minutes. In the meantime the Sosa planes came and went.",0
"Austin to Seattle. I had a problem with a delayed flight and ended up missing a bus connection. The airline staff was very helpful in giving me vouchers to help mitigate the cost of the delayed flight. They were helpful again when I made mistakes with the Vouchers. I appreciate the good pricing of this airline and the great customer service, thank you!",1
"This was our first time flying with Spirit Airline and will be our last. We have had nothing but problems with them. They were rude and even yelling at us over the phone! Let alone, our stroller got lost. Before leaving to go home they gave us another stroller and I asked if we have to return it or what do we do with it. They said keep it. Well now that we're home, over a week later we haven't gotten our stroller and called into Spirit Airlines over 7 times and emailed them about 5 times! Now a week and a half later they finally say they are going to ship it but we have to return the other stroller, when they already told us we could keep it for the inconvenience. Let alone, the customer service employees have been rude the entire time! Never flying with Spirit Airlines again. ",0
"I have traveled many times with Ryanair this year, all flights were on time and arrived on time. I would like to share a incident which we had in Prague airport when I was travelling with my wife and daughter. We went on holiday for a week from Brussels to Prague and then came back from Prague to Brussels on 19th August 2015. We lost our passports in an OBB train in Vienna a day before our return flight. Apart from my Belgium residence card, we didnt have any original proof of identity of my wife and daughter, the staff who manage Ryanair in Prague were very helpful along with the Immigration police officers who helped us board our flight. I really thank Ryanair staff and the staff of the company which manages Ryanair services in Prague airport. We finally found our passports and the OBB staff delivered the same at our residence in Belgium. I would strongly recommend Ryanair.",1
Dhaka to Shenyang via Kunming. Disgusting service and the quality of the airline. Would never recommend this airline. This is by the far the worst airline i have ever took and i'm a very frequent traveler. This had a 6 hour delay before it departed. Never use this airline.,0
My original rant today starts because of Air Canada's online flight tracker. Every time one of our friends comes in from out of town we normally follow their progress online to make sure we don't have much of a wait at the airport. Air Canada doesn't seem to care and leave their customer's rides hanging today it was almost an hour. Now my second rant is from personal experience a number of years back and I tell anyone who asks me which airline they should use and shouldn't. I haven't taken a flight myself with Air Canada since we booked a trip using airmiles and never will again. Our flight to Cancun was originally set for 32 hours 5 stop overs and leaving from an airport an hour and a half away. A few days later I received a call from them to change my itinerary to 26 hours when I asked if they could let me use the airport 10 minutes from my home he said since we put you through the trouble OK. Sleeping in my wheelchair inside of the Mexico City and Guadalajara airport we arrived in Cancun utterly exhausted and me with a diabetic low blood sugar. On the 6 hour flight home with an overnight in Calgary my wife left me ahead to grab our luggage. When they came to get me I told them my supplies were all in the overhead compartment. The rude stewardess wouldn't even look and told me that my wife had everything. I get off of the plane and when I saw my wife she didn't have my jacket medical supplies or test kit. After spending the night trying to retrieve my medical supplies in the city we went home exhausted again. They had the nerve the next day to tell me to come and get my supplies. After them making 3 trips I finally got everything back. Even if I was offered a few flight I will never board another Air Canada plane ever again.,0
"This is the worst airline on the planet, they canceled our flight two day prior to our flight and only one day after purchasing the ticket. I called in to get a refund and they insisted I email them a copy of my bank statement in order to get a refund. I don't know what kind of scam this company is running but don't book with them.",0
"Los Angeles to Sydney. I had a fantastic surprise when I boarded the 787 and that was an upgrade to premium economy which was extremely appreciated as I am over six foot tall. The extra leg room, the seat position over the wing, combined with the great service and enjoyable meals, even a glass of wine, made for a wonderful trip back to Australia, thank you United.",1
"Munich to Antalya. Worst airline ever, the flight was delayed and I missed my connection flight. I was stuck at the airport and SunExpress Customer service told me to book a flight. I had to pay a lot of money to get back to Houston and the airlines said we are not responsible for that. I filed a claim and got a reply that it is not their responsibility!. They closed the case and I'm not able to communicate with them anymore. Save your time and money and fly with decent airlines. never ever fly with this airline.",0
"Frankfurt to Tehran in Lufthansa Premium Economy. For an almost 5 hour flight its quite comfortable. Seats are wider than normal economy, plenty of leg space, good monitors for the IFE. Food is same than economy but served on porcelain instead of plastic. Both flights have been in time, Crew was friendly, food was ok, IFE improve a lot compared to the past. I have critisised Lufthansa a lot in the past, this time nothing to complain and even price was in the range. For this routing and in this class worth to fly with them.",1
We flew Concord to Orlando and back with Allegiant and we loved it. We were careful to read all the rules about baggage etc before we got to the airport so we had no issues there. Yes you do have to pay for even a soda on the flight but it was not a big deal. The flight was comfortable the attendants were nice the flight was a little delayed but not by much and certainly no worse than any other airline. I really don't get all the complaints I have seen on other reviews. I really liked Allegiant!,1
St. Petersburg to Genoa via Paris with Air France. I had a really nice flight in Economy Class. Crew had happy faces and helped for every passenger. Service was excellent and the main thing was that crew was friendly and helped each other. Me and my parents had an unforgettable journey.,1
"Flight from Tehran to Istanbul, no inflight entertainment with not a single business class seat was working. Apparently standard operating procedure at Turkish Airlines, and no apology was given. Flight from Istanbul on an old A330. Overall dismal showing for a business class fare.",0
"After flying all night from HKG to PER via SIN with a budget carrier, it was such a relief to fall asleep in a Qantas A330. Seat comfort was fantastic, food was good quality and an all around enjoyable experience",1
"Efficient boarding, on time departure and arrival. Efficient and friendly service. No IFE for the relatively short flight. Refreshments fine.",1
"Our flight from Nairobi was delayed 3 hours. When we got to Paris we missed our flight to Toronto they told us we have to wait 9 hours, which changed to 14 hours. They lost my stroller. We got to Toronto I miss my flight to come home to Edmonton my luggage are missing nobody wants to help. When I ask they say go to WestJet.",0
Great flight from Dublin to London. Such friendly cabin crew. Flight was punctual and was perfect for this short flight. Will certainly use them again.,1
TK34 from Houston to Istanbul with friends. First time with Turkish and we were very satisfied. Seats were comfortable and the service was good. This trip would have been perfect however on the return to Houston the last meal before landing was not fresh I got rock hard dried out pasta. The way they handled this was a disappointment.,1
"Omaha to San Francisco via Dallas with American Airlines. This airline is a disorganized mess. Do whatever you have to in order to not fly this airline. They overbook flights and beg paying customers to wait for additional delays due to their poor planning. Besides being generally disorganized and thoughtless with customers valuable time, they waited until the entire plane was boarded to inform us that we were delayed by an hour and would have to wait in the plane as they did not have a runway for us to take off or land on. They had us board so they could trap us on the plane with no choice but to wait. This is ridiculous.",0
"I paid the extra several hundred dollars for the Delta comfort plus ticket because of the advertised comfort items that are said to be provided. Being 5 foot tall, the extra legroom was not a factor for me in my purchase. What was a factor was the comfort items said to come with this premium seating a pillow, blanket, etc. I was very disappointed to be told on both of my delta flights that neither a pillow nor a blanket could be provided to me. I was actually very uncomfortable the entire flight as it was very cold and there were no pillows and blankets that I could get, even though that is the entire point of comfort plus seating.",0
"Singapore to Tokyo via Bangkok. There was no online option to change or cancel flight. My first flight on another airline got cancelled last minute and I missed my flight by Thai Airways. I had no ways to contact them because its was after office hours. As a result I got a penalty of no show fee. And they had to cancel the entire itinerary which means I have no return flights to go home. And now that its peak travel period, I had to spend more than triple the original flight fare to get a ticket to go home.",0
Worst airline with highest cancellation rate. They cancel flights two days before scheduled travel which causes us to buy tickets at a higher price from other lines. Will never repeat the same mistake of booking Go First.,0
I travel from the Washington area to Denver several times a year. Previously I used United but I am increasingly using Southwest. The flights are cheaper and the quality of service is higher. My only complaint about Southwest is that the seat could have used a little more padding. I realize delays due to weather or other problems occur but United lies about the cause.,1
"What is happening to British Airways? Flew Vancouver to London. The A380 has to be my favorite long haul aircraft, but BA is definitely not. Cabin crew were friendly and professional, despite not being a full complement of crew. Several dishes were crossed off the menu, apparently due to ongoing dispute? Why? Food was inedible, the worst I have ever been served on a business flight. The seat configuration is outdated, blankets threadbare and pancake thin pillows. The constant cost cutting by their management is now laid bare for all to see, they need to spend some time on a Singapore Airlines aircraft to see what business class really is! BA's golden years are well and truly over, it will take a miracle to bring them back!",0
Just horrendous. I've purchased my tickets 4 months before with no seat number preferences since I fly alone and payed for automatic flight check in. I had to go through all the hassle to go to check in at the airport to get a physical ticket since there was no ticket issued due to overselling of the places. Waiting to ses if any cancellation was a lot of stress for me . I truly hate so much.,0
"San Francisco to Shanghai via Guangzhou. The flight was great, they have quite big and up to date movie collections. The cabin crew was very polite. Refreshment is served on the plane, and food is not bad. The flight was very quiet and pleasant, kids are not so annoying. Overall, it was enjoyable to get to my destination. And at the time I bought the ticket, China Southern Airlines is the cheapest.",1
Taipei to San Francisco. This was my first time flying on EVA air in Royal laurel business class class. The flight was awesome. From the Rimowa amenity kit to the comfortable and stylish PJ's. The food was delicious and the service was excellent. The experience was almost on par to when I flew first class with Lufthansa. Really great airline!,1
"Will never ever fly TAP Portugal again. 55 min flight from Lisbon to Madrid ended up taking 5 hours. Plane delayed for nearly 3 hours, then fly 30 mins pass Madrid, finally over an hour to collect luggage, as machine broke after putting out on wrong belt. Have flown many airlines none as bad as these.",0
Taipei to Los Angeles. It was a really good journey. Flight attendants were very attentive. You got champagne as welcome drink and it was really good. The pajama provided on the long haul flight is very comfortable. I'm still wearing it at home. I had duck breast and it was surprisingly good. I'll totally fly with Eva again.,1
"My first time in the new Club World suite. Excellent, lots of space and privacy, very good seat. I doubt if this can be bettered. Good staff as ever. My only quibble is that the food is all served at once. BA needs to roll this out quickly!",1
Abu Dhabi to CGK last week and I have been really impressed with the level of quality and service. Even though at that time GA encountered problems due to system migration but the agent managed the trip very well. Onboard the aircraft the cabin crew were sweet and charming and seemed to be very professional. The entertainment system must be upgraded though as well as English announcement made by the cabin crew. The food was tasty and cabin crew didn't hesitate to offer more food as the business class was not fully booked. In a sum GA has impressed me and looking forward to fly with them again in the future.,1
Lahore to Karachi. Check in at Lahore was smooth. No problem with boarding. Aircraft was also quite clean and the emergency exit seats were quite comfortable. Cabin crew was courteous and were very thorough with explaining the duties of passengers seated near the emergency exit. Take off and landing on time. Inflight meal was just a sandwich with beverage service,1
Take off on time and landing 20 minutes ahead of schedule. Flight attendants are nice and professional. The check in in Tenerife went OK but the boarding was a bit messy. There was some waiting time at the luggage delivery at Bordeaux Airport. But overall it was my first experience with Volotea and I am quite happy with it.,1
"This was my first time on a long haul flight with British Airways. I found the seats to be very comfortable until a woman in front pushed her seat right back so then the video screen was almost in my face. She refused to put it back when we asked politely. She got out of her seat and stood on my foot which had been recovering from a broken bone, then laughed with her friend. I detected she could cause trouble so decided it was time to move. I explained to the air hostess who immediately accommodated us. She came back a few minutes later to ask if I would like tea and if all was ok. She also brought a colleague with her. I found the staff to be ultra helpful and pleasant. The food was good quality for economy. Previously I would have flown Air Canada but I think British Airways are a better quality airline. I would have no hesitation in recommending British Airways.",1
"After several disappointing flights with Finnair, I had a pleasant experience from BKK to HEL. The cabin crew was absolutely fabulous which made this long daytime flight really nice. The new cabin is fine but suits better for night flights but still ok. The food was good but I really wish they will ho back to serve appetisers separately and not on one tray. Toilets were kept clean frequently.",1
"New York JFK to Sofia return via Frankfurt. I am very pleased with Lufthansa from flight crew, customer service to ground personnel. All four flights were impeccable, on time, no delays, prompt check in. The flight attendants were polite, smiling, attentive, esp to my 4 year old son who was travelling with me. In flight entertainment was wonderful, drinks plenty and always coming, food was good and sufficient. I flew on the A380 on way there and the aircraft was spacious, clean and comfortable. The ground personel at Frankfurt airport was helpful and informative. Lufthansa, you are doing it right!",1
"Melbourne to Sydney. Expensive cab ride to airport, long line security, waiting for gate announcement when a text arrives saying flight cancelled! No reasons. No other flights. No word of assistance or help. We ended up renting a car and driving all night 9 hours door to door. Tigerair is a disgrace and anyone thinking of flying with them should make another plan",0
FLL to EWR to SFO. UA1024 for the EWR leg firstly the pilot taxied too close to the corner and got stuck in snow. Solved that with a pull out and then the fun started. Pilot came on and said we are rerouted and he doesn't have enough fuel but that he is protesting with the tower. Over an hour later we are at a gate being fuelled. The gate agent refused to assist me in finding another route home since 2 hours had passed and I was certain I'd missed my connection in SFO. No hotel because they said the delay was due to weather not incompetence. The new customer focus they speak of is a facade. Flight was Feb 21. SFO has comfortable chairs but not to sleep on.,0
Omaha to Denver. I was impressed with McKayla at the front desk she went above and beyond to help me and such a kind agent. Thank you for the experience she provided over here in Omaha airport at the ticket counter.,1
Flights from Calgary AB to Hamilton ON are always on time. Seats are comfortable and TV is a plus. Snacks are OK. Staff are quick and cheerful. No complaints!,1
Sydney to Zurich via Hong Kong. The crews on both flights were fantastic. They went our of their way to make the flights a pleasure. I ordered a special meal and it was delicious. The seat was comfortable and the duvets warm. I cannot say much about the entertainment system because I was listening only to classical and jazz music. I flew Cathay before and had high expectations. They were met.,1
"Auckland to Kuala Lumpur. I travel extensively and this airline has the worst imaginable customer service I have ever faced. Having spent 4 hrs on the phone sorting out an issue with them the staff were rude, unhelpful and just lazy. They kept trying to defer the problem and asking me to call back the following day. They did not call back themselves after promising to therefore had to spent hours longer on the phone. They also refused to put a supervisor on the phone. My business has always used Malaysia Airlines due to where I work but I will never use them again.",0
"Very nice and pleasant flight with LOT on this route, comfortable seats. Flight took 40 mins, the boarding was fast. Was given a free drink and snack despite the very short flight. Overall highly recommend this airline on this route",1
"Dunedin to Auckland. I was given plenty of warnings about JetStar but I still flew. I am happy to report service was great from the check in to baggage claim. The check in staff was friendly with a great sense of humor, boarding was smooth, and the cabin crew pleasant. I even got a sandwich, which is more than I received on my flight to Dunedin on Air New Zealand. The crew moved up and down the cabin many times being solicitous of our wellbeing. Compared to Air NZ domestic, JetStar is the star.",1
"Mauritius to Johannesburg. The food was appalling, disgusting and it tasted like left overs from couple of days before. Canned food taste much better. Even the staff was speechless when I showed them how bad the food quality was. The only option they had for me was some Pretzels. I can only have Muslim meal and I was Not the only one with the Muslim meal option who complained on that flight. Too much for a coincidence to me. Purchased my ticket to travel by SAA but unfortunately ended up in the disappointing Air Mauritius. What a shame",0
"Auckland to Los Angeles. Horrible Experience. Rude flight attendants, cramped space and very uncomfortable seats. We had more leg room in our much shorter connecting flight from LA to Seattle with Alaska Airlines. Our flight from Auckland to LA was a pitiful excuse for an international flight. I would rather fly 14 hours with Qantas via their connections rather than sit through 12 hour with American Airlines. My husband and I swore off American Airlines before our plane even left the ground. I can't believe this airline is still in business.",0
"Flew Palermo to Bucharest. I do not recommend Ryanair to anyone and I strongly suggest to avoid this horrible company. They lost my baggage during a flight, I called daily to the airport, I talked daily to the Ryanair customer service which, obviously, could not help, and in the end I can say that I did everything I could to get it back or to get a refund, but nobody cared at all. The information they give is not clear, the time they put me to wait was between 7 and 21 days and even like this nothing changed. Everybody is sorry, but nobody does anything. Plus, onboard they do not have the food they are supposed to sell. Horrible company!",0
Flown Emirates from Gatwick LGW To Brisbane BNE via Dubai DXB. Seats was comfortable but the inflight entertainment was excellent. Cabin crews always smiled and food was ok. I would fly with them again.,1
Left for Costa Rica January 8th 2014 return was due for January 20 2014 arrived on January 23rd. Never take an International Flight with a connection and leave 1 hour between flights the flight back from Costa Rica was delayed then customs held us up then the door slammed in our face as we arrived in time to watch it close. We were told we would be put on standby for the next flight well 5 flights later and nothing. For what we spent because they overbook I could have gone first class on a reputable airline.,0
"Charlotte to Minneapolis. Our flight was delayed due to other issues than weather leaving Charlotte this evening. In trying to determine whether to book a new flight in Charlotte we asked the staff. We were told that we had ten to fifteen minutes and should sit up front and run to the next concourse. We did not know it was on the other side of the airport. So we upgraded sat up front and ran to B22 in Chicago Midway to make our connection home to Minneapolis. Even though we made it to the gate and saw the plane sitting there, we were told that it was gone and we had to book a flight 3 hours later. And we needed to go back to where we were told to run from. There was no communication to the gate that passengers were running across the airport. This airport is the worst Southwest hub in the world and this was the second and last experience there. Southwest can do better than this.",0
"I was supposed to take the 6.55am flight from Hong Kong to Seoul. Arrived at the airport at 5.45am, but was told at the check in to leave behind a telephone number and to come back in 5min. 5mins later the lady at the check in told me that the flight was overbooked and that she would need to reschedule me at the 5pm flight. As such I would miss a full day of my trip. Only explanation given was that the plane changed to a smaller one. Compensation was HKD1645, which far from compensates for the time lost.",0
"Hamilton to Cancun. Worst customer service and corporate follow up imagineable The plane never got off the ground. After boarding, we were held onboard over 3 hours after we were otherwise ready to push back. This isn't clear violation to Swoop's tariff for international flights, which calls for taking passengers off the plane after 2 hours, and offering food and drink after 90 minutes. We were held on board over three hours and refused food and drink. This was after having the flight delayed for more than two hours earlier in the day because the crew needed rest. Ultimately, we are all pulled off the plane and had to wait another hour or so until somebody in Calgary decided whether or not to cancel the flight. Weather conditions ultimately led to the flight, and three other Swoop flights trying to leave Hamilton at the same time. Of course, none of us can control the weather, but an airline can control the customer service it offers its passengers. This is where Swoop failed so miserably. Swoop ground staff had no idea how to handle the situation in front of them effectively. They gave conflicting information. They behaved rudely. they clearly couldn't care less about the individuals involved and the impact it was having on them. Yes, people were upset, but their vacation plans had just been ruined. For the folks working at the airport, this is just their job. Provide customer service and do it well. Well, they didn't do that. on the plane, the flight crew advised us to contact swoops customer service department in Calgary. Of course, anybody who tried to do so immediately learned that Swift customer service in Calgary was closed. Since the cancellation, it has just been a continued serious of frustrations trying to contact and get any kind of satisfaction out of swoop. It might look like you're saving money when you see the Swoop price, but to my mind, it isn't worth the hassle. Don't let them ruin your vacation. I ended up flying on a different airline out of a different airport the morning following the Swoop disaster. Cost me a fortune since I live thousands of miles from Hamilton and had no way to get around easily. But it was worth knowing that I wouldn't have to put up with Swoop again.",0
I picked this flight from Denver to Miami to surprise a friend of mine. Got delayed twice. Asked why and they just said the plane hasnt left yet. Over 3 hours of delay. Still waiting to see if I get delayed again. Options is get my money back or get a food voucher. All food places are closed now. Just stay away from Frontier Airlines unless you have hours to kill in an airport. Happens so often that customer service has an I don't care attitude about it. I hope they fix the problems or go out of business.,0
"Bag damaged on flight, and not possible to file PIR at London Gatwick due to no counter available. Customer service extremely unhelpful. I tried to explain to them that the Lost and Found counter and Gatwick refused to file my complaint as they only dealt with lost luggage and not damaged bags",0
After months of sending emails and requests I finally received an Aer Lingus voucher for a flight cancelled in May. It now transpires that I cannot even use this voucher to pay for an outstanding balance on changing flight dates with Aer Lingus. Customer service has been absolutely appalling throughout.,0
Geneva to Brussels in C class. Another great flight with Brussels Airlines. Top service on board and impeccable manners by the cabin crew. Despite the short flight time they provided full meals service and endless drinks. Very good public announcement. Departed and landed on time. Will be flying with the soon again.,1
"Alitalia was a combination of a substantial delay, horrible service and a bad overall experience. Most noteable was the service, or lack thereof. Well, maybe no service would have been better than the treatment we had to endure during this flight. Apparently, if you order a vegetarian meal, and another one, and receive a confirmation that your orders are OK, you should not trust it. At least mistrust was the attitude of the stewardess during the flight. When we asked why didn't we receive our vegetarian meals, the stewardess gave us the clear feeling that she did not believe that we had made the request in the first place. No effort was made to check if such meals could be offered. The food that we did eat and the food that others receivd, was nothing to write home about as well. The flight attendant had very little patience for us passengers and had to reprimand one of us in a rather rude manner. The only entertainment during the flight was the change of scenery outside the windows. Even the onboard magazine was old and well used.",0
"We were lied to about waiting for our flight before it was cancelled. We were then sent to wait for over an hour in a line to receive further assistance while the remaining spirit staff stared at us. At this point we realized that their staff was on strike by looking up local news on our phones. Others in line mentioned they were already stranded since the night before. Because of this we had to book elsewhere. All flights were full from this airport so we had to get a rental car, drive it to Orlando and book a flight through another airline. We have a letter showing crew as the reason for cancelled flight. I have contacted customer support and they could only offer a refund of partial amount of flight without giving an amount. The email us a complaint link gives a 403 error on spirit.com. lastly we filed a request for refund support using chat but this was all automated and ended saying they will see if our flight cancellation is eligible for refund yet again no way to see amounts. So we might get a refund when we lost 24 hours and spent more to get home, and we were the lucky ones compared to others in line.",0
"Edinburgh to Malta with Lufthansa. Never flown with them before but needed a return to Edinburgh and this was the only option. Transfer time was not enough at under an hour at Frankfurt as it is a huge airport but luckily the next flight was delayed anyway due to bad weather in EDI. This is an airline like they used to be, good food, friendly staff, comfy seats and lots of leg room. Only got a sandwich as short flight but what a sandwich, free tea with a cold drink also and refills as needed. Every thing on both flights went like clockwork with true German efficiency just like Aldi but with Waitrose quality. The food was handed out quickly but politely and the real clincher was the rubbish was collected at just the right time so as not to leave you with the tray down for ages. Even my grandchildren at 11 and 12 travelling with us were impressed. So on our many trips planned to Malta it's Lufthansa or bust, cost won't come into it but will allow at least 2 hours for transfer as can't gallop these days at over 60. It seems to me that these low cost airlines have dragged most of the others down to their level. Not Lufthansa though.",1
Flight BA 545 from Bologna to London Heathrow on 29th July was operated by Finnair. This was a delayed flight on an A321 aircraft and even with the delay I was rather impressed! The cabin crew stood in sharp contrast to the rude and indifferent Bologna Airport Staff! The Finnair cabin crew were very organised and polite and suitably firm with certain passengers during the boarding process. The cabin crew took security seriously and although the flight was under two hours they served water and crisps and hot drinks were for sale too. The crew mentioned that they were embarrassed to charge for tea and coffee on behalf of BA. There was little information from the Captain on the flight but the landing was soft and disembarkation was efficient.,1
"I flew with AirAsia 6 timea this past 2 weeks, not a single flight was on time. There was zero courtesy shown by staff to the peaple they are delaying. The airline showed zero responsibility towards people with connecting flights on the same airline or other airlines. I hated every minute with them. All this while forgetting it was not really a budget choice nor was there any added value for the cost.",0
"The worst airline ever! Please never ever book from Go First even if you have to spend a little extra. There is zero value for money and negative convenience. Last time I flew with my mother and she was little sick and then the airline told us that the flight got further delayed by 1.5 hour. It was so cold and my mother's health kept declining and there was nothing we could do about it. Later, I tried a lot to contact their team and ask for refund but I got no response. So please, never book from Go First. It's absolutely the worst!",0
"United has quickly become my least favorite airline. Upon my 2 day travel to Phoenix, I arrive to the airport with my purse and my backpack. I'm unable to carry on my backpack because ""that's just the fare that I purchased."" After asking when they implemented this new rule, the women replied, ""don't argue with me ma'am."" I was simply asking a question. As a woman, I should be able to carry a purse and a backpack onto a plane. Now, after careful planning, on my way home I now have to check my small 8 pound backpack and will be late for work in order to wait for it at my destination. These ""new rules"" were never clearly stated when I purchased my ticket. I also purchased 2 tickets under one credit card and they put my husband and I on opposite sides of the plane. United treats their basic economy class as lower individuals and I will never travel with them again.",0
Washington to Vienna. I'm happy to share that I had a great experience with Austrian Airlines. I was especially worried because I had my dog down in cargo and it was one of the hottest days of the summer back in DC. The staff was very professional and kind when answering my questions about my dog's well being. The flight was smooth and I was quickly reunited with my animal!,1
"Iquitos to Lima. I don't usually write reviews, but seen as there is nothing else for me to do right now, here we go. This is the third time I'm flying with Latam domestically in Peru in less than a week and for the third time now my flight is delayed. I am waiting at Iquitos airport now. My flight was supposed to depart at 2.30pm, it is now 3pm. The aircraft is nowhere to be seen. Staff have no idea when it will arrive. I may miss my connecting flight from Lima to Madrid. You are a joke Latam airlines.",0
Christchurch to Nelson. Never ever recommend flying DOMESTIC in New Zealand. Most of the time I see AIR NZ delayed so it spoiled your schedule. First they give reason for delay due to weather. After they put on hold due to not put the fuel on time. They have no value of time. Really feel bad. I have to cancel all the other plans just for AIR NZ.,0
"We had to cancel because of covid. Now they don't want to reimburse us. They keep our money, and tell us that we have a year to use the credit. They are stupid for applying the exact same rules than before, and forgetting to include covid in the equation. We didn't cancel by choice. We cannot go anymore because of the pandemic. And it's still gonna be the same in 2021. Their lack of understanding disappoints me greatly and that just shows us that American Airlines doesn't care about their customers. At least Air Canada and Air transat reimbursed their customers. I will never fly with them anymore. And I hope other people will do the same.",0
"San Francisco to Warsaw via Copenhagen. Creates so many rules in customer service that you cannot be helped. Do not try to understand people. They are just for profit not for people. I was affected by their strike and they are not ready to help me, just protect them by their interest",0
"4 flights cancelled due to storm except there wasn't a storm anymore. I was in contact with my wife, storm passed 3 days ago. Yet every flight was canceled. Last flight the flight crew never showed up. They won't give me a refund, only credit. Like I want you use their incompetent company again. My holidays were ruined by Southwest Airlines. There was nothing to do with mother nature, sheer lack of ability to fulfill the ticket.",0
"Muscat to Dubai. FlyDubai has gone south. Instead of improving they have gotten so much worse. Delays guaranteed no matter when you take the flight. My one hour flight delayed 45 minutes to one hour on each leg. You can't blame the staff, but there is no sense of urgency or sorry. Most importantly, FlyDubai has hiked their prices so much that they are comparable if not more expensive than the competing airline flying the same route.",0
"Absolutely terrible, they cancelled the flight on July 15th and then we got notified that our flight is going to be on the next day. The flight was supposed to be at 6.15 but the it got delayed until 10. Then, it got delayed till 12 and when everybody was waiting, they said it was cancelled.",0
"Melbourne via Gold Coast to Narita. 29th March. Departed Melb at 6.10am and had a four hour wait at Coolangatta airport. Attempted to change the domestic flight to the day before but was told ""this flight is booked as a single booking and can't be changed"". So we assumed our luggage would be checked through from Melb. No had to collect luggage and check in again. Not a big deal but we fail to see why we could not change our domestic flight. The flights were good. Gold Coast to Narita was flight was excellent. The crew was excellent. Very attentive always had a smile. When you fly with a happy crew it does make a difference. Food and beverages were of a good standard. Flying on the 787 was fantastic. The only real negative is no priority luggage collection for Business Class. Can't be that difficult to do.",1
The airline has been delaying flight for 12 hours without apologies and didn't give option to change ticket. Same price as if I would like to change other flight. The extra charge is very disappointing.,0
Bag drop at Edinburgh efficient but staff miserable. On board both ways the cabin crew were fantastic. Polite professional and nothing was too much trouble. Handling at Tenerife also excellent. Quick and efficient. Would recommend.,1
"I was disgusted with my flight from Auckland to Singapore. I found the food inedible, wine was a sauvignon which I don't like, I asked for Chardonnay just got a no. Toilets were dirty. We have a suit hanger when boarding to be hung and when we disembarked we saw it in the floor, when I asked why it was just dumped on the floor instead of hung up they had a no response attitude. Second leg to Heathrow I am just boarding now and dreading the overnight flight. Will not use them again.",0
Prague to Ovda. Its was my first time that I flew with Ryanair and I am really disappointed. When we took the flight from ovda all was good without any discomfort. On the way back they check every little thing and when I ask where all of this instructions are written they didn't had an answer. And just did its a lot harder. I really would consider next time if to fly with this company.,0
"After being stranded by Hainan Airlines, Delta stepped up and not only was able to get me on a flight at a competitive rate, but I was surprised their quality of service, seat room and meals as well as waiting area accommodations were all superior to what I've been putting up with for years. Absolutely no doubt both my wife and I will do all our travels to China with Delta from now on, but they will get our recommendation at every opportunity.",1
"N8986Z Flight 293 Mar 26 2015. Flight 360 Mar 31 2015. Had a great trip because I knew what to expect. I had a backpack no carry on printed out my boarding pass before going to the airport. It was only a two hour flight but I ate and drank before I boarded. I am 5'2"" so the seats were comfortable. Entertained myself with my iPad. There were a lot of kids but the parents were on top of the situation and kept the kids calm.",1
Flew Brussels to Xian through Beijing. From start to finish the staff service was excellent. Ok some of their English is not what you may expect as a foreign traveler but they try so hard smile and are genuine. Food was top class on all flights and seat comfort is much better than European carriers like Lufthansa or KLM. Airport service no bad in Beijing but this was little slow because you need to change terminal. Otherwise all is highlight recommended and I will travel them again soon.,1
"My adult son, who is visually impaired, travelled alone for the first time and booked assistance on his American Airlines flights from Manchester to Pittsburgh via Philadelphia. He was looked after at every point of the flights. Thank you for looking after him.",1
EK355 Singapore to Dubai A380 10 April 2014. We had aisle seats the service was excellent with an excellent meal. Inflight entertainment was extremely good with a vast selection to choose from during the 8 hour flight. Flight left a little late but arrived on time into Dubai at 0.55. Cabin crew very attentive and provided great service to those of us in cattle class throughout the flight.,1
Phoenix to Detroit. Great staff. Lost glasses on flight. They helped look for them. Checked on us many times. Flight was smooth and drinks and snacks. We're right on time. I have never flown Southwest before and upset I didn't. Keep up the amazing job.,1
This is my third flight on frontier. I have never had an issue on any other airline before. Every one of my Frontier flights have had issues. I have had my flight listed as on time and then cancelled while waiting to board. And now 5 minutes before boarding they delay the flight over two hours. This will be my last flight with them as you cannot contact customer support for anything. Even their chat fails. They even said the flight is delayed due to weather in Nashville which has little to no wind and no chance of rain for the entire day. They seem to have forgotten people have weather apps. Worst airline ever.,0
"Auckland to Christchurch. Air NZ shares code with Singapore Airlines and even for a combined itenery Air Nz is too lazy to pass the check in baggage with partner airlines. I had to manually take my check in luggage and check in again on my further way to Singapore with just layover time of 1.5 hr. On top of it, Air NZ staff at Auckland reception desk at domestic terminal is too blunt and rude that I have done a mistake by buying Air NZ ticket. She told me that if I will show attitute then she would call her boss, while I just got frustrated, attitude is a word when you raise your voice and start getting angry. she has more power like she was suffering there. Ugly and useless people are hired by Air Nz in customer service like answering prisoners committing crime buyong their ticket. Last time with Air NZ, better is even Jetstar.",0
London to Tel Aviv via Rome. The service was very bad throughout the flight and the main part of the meal provided consisted of cold turkey slices. There were screens on every seat but none of them worked. I wouldn't recommend Alitalia to anyone unless they change the quality of the flight experience.,0
"My flight from Leipzig to Belgrade via Frankfurt was delayed for one hour, so they made a change to fly via Munich, so that I could make my connection flight to Belgrade. The Munich flight was delayed for 45 minutes, so I have 10 minutes for connection on Munich airport. Cabin crew didn't make any effort to give me some information or contact someone on gate. I made it after running to the gate. And in the end, I am arriving to Belgrade, and my baggage is mislaid.",0
"My experience flying with the PIA was awful. As it was my first time in a few years, I expected improvements. The in flight entertainment TV was not working which was the worst part. As you can see in the other reviews, PIA is not an airline to fly. The only good part about flying with them is that they fly direct which is a must for some people.",0
"This airline double charge me for a ticket. I saw it on my bank account statement, they double charge me on the very same day that the 1st ticket was booked. I called to ask about this, they blamed it on the booking company and the booking company said that it was definitely Frontier Airlines that charged the duplicate ticket and according to my bank statement it's coming directly from their denver headquarters so they definitely did it. They argued with me for an hour on the phone refusing to do anything about their mistake, blaming me for it and making me pay for the errors. I would advise all people to never trust most of the booking companies out there and most importantly don't deal with Frontier, they do nothing for customer service.",0
"From Doha to Cochi. Qatar Airways Economy class is great, really good service. I am very impressed by cabin crew staff Miss Sakie who served the QR 516 Economy class. The way she deal with the clients are impressive and she was really helpful as well",1
Honolulu to Los Angeles and a full red eye flight. The hard working crew were gracious and seats up front most comfortable. I passed on the meal so I could relax and enjoy the IFE. FAs helped a couple quiet their screaming infant who thankfully slept most of the way. Otherwise just a hassle free trip on Delta.,1
I have regularly used Latam Airlines in the past. After having my flight cancelled on the 2nd May 2020 due to Coronavirus. I am left extremely frustrated waiting for a refund. It has been 4 months now.  I keep contacting my travel agency and all they have to say is Latam have authorised a full refund but have not issued the money. I wonder how long they will drag this on.,0
"Worse airline ever with no care about the passengers! I had a ticket with this airline, I missed the flight and I didn't fly with this flight, however I was just there 3, 4 minutes far from the gate. The corresponding people didn't call my name, I didn't hear anything, otherwise I could just run to arrive to the gate for boarding, and even when I arrived there they didn't say anything, so I just thought the flight has delay. Then I asked people standing at the gate myself and they said boarding is closed now. I asked them for a help or rebooking the flight or even giving me a phone number to call the airline, they didn't help at all. Then I found a number myself and called LOT customer service, they also didn't help me at all. They could rebook the flight for the same day or even another day which is the least that every airline does that for their passengers but LOT customer service didn't do that. I had to spend a lot of money and time that day at the airport because of this. This airline has no customer service to help passengers and they actually don't care about the passengers and their money and time at all. I will never buy a ticket from this airline.",0
"Ft Lauderdale to Covington. We waited in line for over an hour and there were no Allegiant workers at the desk even checking customers in for their flights. Not one worker. On our flight here the staff were rude when we checked in. The quality of the plane was poor, and there were additional fees for baggage and refreshments on the plane which are typically complimentary with other airlines. Do not fly Allegiant.",0
"Gatwick to Rome. Booked with Vueling via BA. turned up at LGW, queued to check in at Vueling desk to be told tickets hadn't been issued, despite confirmation emails and filling in API info. After 90 minutes discovered it was a BA glitch. Flight 60 mins late leaving, seat on row 3 had plenty of room, but i think this was an extra legroom seat that we hadn't paid for. Flight back from Rome was pretty bad, and 90 minutes late leaving. As we'd sat at the gate for a long time we needed a snack on the plane, and looking at the picture of a Cheese, pesto and sun dried tomato focaccia we paid our 6.5 Euros looking forward to something tasty. Big mistake! Tiny pieces of cheese a wipe of pesto and some minute tomato's. I complained to the female crew member and her reply was that it wasn't her fault as she hadn't made it. A pretty grubby aircraft didn't help. A very poor experience.",0
Most pathetic airline. I was travelling 2nd time and each time the flight is delayed. No help and support for delayed on airport. We were just waiting for hours to depart on the flight.,0
"First time flying with Spirit. They are horrible, worst flight I ever dealt with! I will never use or recommend them. We miss our flight because they did not call our flight. Wanted to rebook for two days later. Had to pay for another hotel stay. In order to leave next day had to fly American which cost me 1600.",0
"Bangkok to Khon Kaen. Thai Smile is my first choice when I travel by plane. The seat is comfortable, more leg room. The flight attendants are nice and helpful. Smooth taking off and landing.",1
Portland to Seattle. Their policy counted a fishing rod as an extra item requiring me to check a bag through my final destination jeapordizing the contents of in the bag. The lady scanning tickets was very rude and challenged the validity of my final destination. I would never book a flight with Sky West!,0
"On my way from Miami to Sacramento I needed to catch a flight to Sacramento. There was little time,25 minutes between arriving in Dallas and leaving. Just prior to boarding the plane I informed the attendant that I had left my MacbookAir on my Miami flight. Instead of having someone call the gate and have them check for Mac she said to go online and report missing. It has now been over a week and my Mac has not showed up. How hard would it have been to take a few minutes to try to help me find prior to being lost?",0
Cheap but will never fly with them again. New planes however none of the staff speak English they only serve warm beer or cold red wine. They don't serve diet coke coke zero or mineral water. They left us on the tarmac for 2.5 hours without any explanation of the delay or what was happening. Going via China from Australia to LA added an extra 8 hours to the trip and the cost of a coffee at the Chinese international airport was 23AUD.,0
"I want to commend JetBlue gate attendants and crew on my recent trip to Cancun from Charlestonand the trip back from Ft. Lauderdale. Somehow they knew I was celebrating my birthday, and they went over the top by upgrading my seat, free drinks, blankets, and signed cards. I was overwhelmed by their exceptional customer service and friendliness. They definitely started the celebration of my 70th birthday, and it is an experience I'll never forget. A huge ""thank you"" to Laura and CHS airport crew, Dylan and Jennifer and Jet Blue Crew!",1
"Flew Dallas to Chicago. This may be the only airline in the world to treat a nervous 19 year old girl with the most rude and unapologetic attitude. This was my first time flying alone so yes, I was a bit nervous. No one told me that asking questions was completely ridiculous. Being told that ""I'm old enough to know these things"" or that ""its not rocket science"" is beyond rude. United, you wont be getting my business again.",0
Minneapolis to Fort Myers. I have never seen a worse airline towards COVID. Full plane with kids and people with no masks. No chance I will ever touch this airline again.,0
"Sydney to Gold Coast. Arrive at Sydney airport. Chaos everywhere. People not knowing where to go. Not ONE support staff on the floor helping anyone. No where in sight. It was not during holiday period so really it should have been a seamless process. Will never fly Virgin again. Would it be hard to also have some lighting system in place so you know what counter is serving the next person? They have staff yelling out to the next person in line with their hand up. And then get on the plane and put down my tray and its dirty, so was my daughters. Pathetic.",0
"Alaska Airlines is the worst that I have flown on. Not only did they give up my seat from Seattle to Anchorage, the gate employee and the customer service agent was very rude. They didn't offer anything to fix the problem and rebooked me for a flight 6 hours later than my original, middle seat, after I have been flying for about 18 hours.",0
Flair Airlines is by far the worst airline I have ever traveled on in my lifetime. Customer Service is not even on any scale of 1 to 10. It should be rated a big fat zero. Our flight was delayed for more than 2.5 hours without any compensation from this airline. I would advise everyone to avoid Flair Airlines even though it's ultra discounted.,0
"Singapore to Tokyo. The flight was fully packed, but we still manage to fly on time and reach there slightly earlier than scheduled. I flew with friends and took a row of seat. We  accidentally spilled a drink, and the stewardess was  smiling as they help us clean the mess, they also keep coming back to us to check if our seats are dry, giving us extra napkins and later, extra blankets telling us to sit on it. What a pleasant experience. In flight entertainment was great, plenty of choices, and movies from all over the world. One thing though, we found the leg space to be slightly smaller than usual, not sure if it was all the winter clothing we had with us, or the seat space shrunk. We chose different meals, and tried each others', they taste great.",1
I flew BMI regional from Southampton to Munich on an Embraer RJ145. There was a total of nine passengers on this flight giving the feel of a private jet instead of a small airliner. Complimentary ham roll and coffee served. Crew fine. Left and arrived on time.,1
"Vancouver to Tokyo, Japan and a good airline to travel with.  I have traveled to Tokyo and Taiwan many times with Japan Airlines, and the food is very good in my opinion. The inflight entertainment could have more games,  or some other service but in general it is very nice. ",1
"Don't fly United! They always have delays for whatever reasons. I fly a handful times each year, and unfortunately, I have to fly United since they're based in Houston. I'm sitting at the airport in Vegas now waiting for our plane to be repaired. We all boarded, sat there for half an hour, then deplaned. Supposed to leave at 11.30 am, delayed until 3 pm, delayed again until 4 pm. Who knows if I'll ever get home. So many people missed connecting flights. While sitting here waiting for the plane to be fixed, I hear agents announcing that this flight or that flight is overbooked! This seems to be the norm with United. I've only left on time once in the past 8 flights. Some delays were due to weather, but most were not weather related. If you have options, choose another airline.",0
"Their agents at in Denver are very rude and not knowledgeable at all. I had to purchase a ticket at the counter asked agent to add checked bags, which she didn't. I did not know this until I got ready to check my bag and was told by another agent that my checked bags were not added. I went back to the ticket counter and was told 3 different prices to have my bags checked. Asked for manager, the manager refused to speak with me, called customer service and waited almost an hour for someone to pick up, yet and still the customer service agent over the phone gave no help or insight with my issue and didn't take my complaint nor did they address any of my issues that I had with these rude, unknowledgeable staff.",0
"On Tuesday, April 4th 2017, I flew back home with American Airlines to Dallas Fort Worth Airport. My flight was scheduled to depart at 5.50 pm. At around 5.30, when it was time to board, they announced that the flight would be delayed because the First Officer was in Washington D.C. and his flight had not yet departed for LGA. Flight was delayed a half hour, later they came back saying that the plane had still not departed and it probably wouldn't be until much later. At around 7.00 pm, the pilot announced that the First Officer's flight had barely taken off and hopefully we could depart by 8 pm. We finally began boarding at around 7.30 pm and did not depart until almost 8.30 pm. I was supposed to land in DFW at 8.45 pm and did not land until past 11.00 pm. I reached out to AA hoping they could somehow fix this situation since it was not mechanical, operational or due to weather and the most I got was an apology. Unfortunately AA has been declining in punctuality and Customer service. It is no as longer reliable as it used to be. Very disappointing.",0
Nashville to Houston. This is absolutely the worst airline. I will never fly again with United. I booked four flights and needed to change one of the passengers names. My husband was originally going but because of work he could not so I wanted to change the passenger to my son. They would not under any circumstances allow me to do so. It is apparent this airline cares nothing about their customers!,0
"Worst company. Flight was delayed 3 hours to destination. Customer service was brutal, no communication and flight on the way home had one person working the check in. Missed our flight cause we waited 3 hours before being checked in.",0
"Their customer service lady was rude and once I ask her to slow down to help me walk through and understand my itinerary, she got mad and told me to contact the travel agent. I simply asked to transfer the call to someone up the chain so that I can ask my question but she refused. I would not recommend travel with this airline and waste your money. Please stay away from them as their customer service folks are very rude and unsupportive.",0
"This was the early morning flight from Manchester to Amsterdam, which I have flown several times before. This flight was punctual, and we arrived on time. Onboard service was excellent, with a breakfast sandwich and hot and cold drinks provided. I recommend KLM for short haul and long haul flights. They've never let me down.",1
"Muscat to Frankfurt. Worst airline I have ever travelled with. Flight was delayed, staff is incapable and unfriendly, airplane was old and dirty, toilets were dirty, bad and greasy food, seat was broken.",0
My flight was delayed 4 hours. Was kept on a 32 degree plane for 45 minutes with no air conditioning. The staff embarrassed slightly larger people by moving them to the back of the plane to 'balance' the weight. Once finally in the air the turbulence was awful. Around 20 minutes before the plane landed the captain announced that our bags were not in the luggage hold and was 'sincerely apologetic'. We were promised our bags within 24 hours but now have been told that we won't have our bags for another 3 days!,0
"Flight will leave even when you make it on time. My bags were on the plane and I arrived at 6.40, 20 minutes before the plane was scheduled to depart at 7. A girl boarded 30 seconds before I got there. The staff were extremely unkind to me, he told me I was not able to board even though I made the flight by 20 minutes. My family was on the flight already and told them I was running late. Terrible service. My bags were on the plane, it departed with my bags still on. No refunds or apologies by anyone. I would not recommend this airline.",0
"Great flights, Brisbane to Amsterdam via Taipei, and I was surprised at just how good they were. Crew were some of the best I've encountered, friendly helpful and efficient. Seats in premium economy offered plenty of space and were comfortable enough for the long flight, managed a few hours sleep. Food was also decent for airline meals! I wouldn't hestitate to recommend EVA Air to others, they definitely give established 5 Star carriers such as Cathay and Singapore a run for their money.",1
"I had no real issues at all flying here. The flight was delayed due to plane getting in late. I do not fault the airline because I don't know circumstances of delay, but know it happens on every airline. All staff were pleasant. Seats are very small with little legroom. But I'm 5'2"", so no problem. If it were a long flight, I'd be bummed, but it wasn't. Plus they do indicate legroom restrictions on their site, so I knew in advance. I chose to fly no frills and was prepared. I only took a personal item, no didn't need to pay additional carry on charges. I see so many negative reviews, but they are up front on their site, so unsure why complaints of things they should have read. I would fly Frontier Airlines again for short distances.",1
"London to Zurich. A budget airline at premium prices. Lots of late and cancelled flights. Pay for luggage, food and drinks. Poor customer services even at Silver level. I have had flights cancelled in the past and after a long time on the phone offered an alternative flight from another airport. No assistance for transport.",0
"Horrible! They sell you a flight, secure your payment and then change your flight and offer you a Jetblue credit for a future flight. Truly Horrible. You can try to complain or even just request some assistance but their website is designed to frustrate you and retard any real progress. I avoid flying as much as possible because of how the airlines rip us off and screw us around. I also can't believe our so called rulers have sold us all out and just let these horrible corporations to do whatever they want to customers without any accountability.",0
Highly disappointed. Flight was scheduled to leave at 630 am. Sitting on the flight line and might miss my connecting flight. Can't believe they'd board people if the plane needs maitenance while we are sitting on it. It should be put aside and a better plane to fly us safely to Charlotte. I'm connecting to Seattle and probably will miss my connecting flight. Very disappointed in this airline.,0
LOT 02 ORD to WAW 16 January 2014 Business Class. Airport Lounge left something to be desired but the peace and quiet was very welcome. Service on board the aircraft was superb. Business Class was served by 3 excellent personnel. In the first 90 minutes of the flight dinner was over and we were able to get to sleep. You didn't have to ask for anything. On time at both ends. Price was right service and aircraft were super.,1
London to Duesseldorf on 21 January. Flew with them 10 times over a one month period. This was the last of those flights. 8 of the 10 flights were changed or cancelled. The flight I was booked in for this day was cancelled again shortly before departure. Mayhem at the T5 customer service desk. Far too few people to serve. Seats on BA are terrible. Everything costs extra. There is nothing good about BA anymore.,0
"Spirit is one of the worst airlines. My advice is pay more for another airline because in the end you will have a better experience, pay less for luggage and may even save money.",0
"Raleigh Durham to Las Vegas. Worst airline, every flight has been delayed 3 hours and one flight was delayed 3 days. Now my flight home after waiting 3 days of waiting is delayed and they are asking for people to volunteer to get a different flight.",0
"Saint Petersburg to London via Zurich. Absolute worst airline experience. Coming back Saint Petersburg there was no priority boarding at Saint Petersburg, it was more lile a free for all, so disorganised. The flight was delayed into Zurich but I managed to make the flight, only to find that they failed to put my bags on the plane to London. I talked to the Swiss rep about the bag, so matter of fact about the bags being left behind and telling me it will be a full day before I receive my luggage. I asked why they were not put on the next flight which was due to arrive 2 hours after my flight but no explaination. Not what I expected from Swiss, especially not as a Business Class customer. Totally disgraceful. Swiss should be ashamed.",0
"Guayaquil to Miami. Horrible experience, the flight was late and we missed our connection. The crew told me that after our delay we would be on time. The agent at the airport was no help. On top of it our meal at the plane was as cheap as it can get, and it was an international flight. I will never fly American Airlines again. I would give a 0 rating if there was the possibility.",0
"Kuala Lumpur to Auckland. I arrived at KUL at 2PM on 20th June from Sri Lanka expecting to fly to Auckland at 11.25pm. All my plans got shattered from the moment I heard that the flight scheduled to leave at 1130PM will be delayed by about 8 hours. Delays can happen but there has to be a proper way to handle these things. I was asked to go to a hotel with food vouchers but immigration officers rejected to allow us to go out due to err on the boarding pass. Several times I went here and there without any meaning wasting my time.  So there has to be a proper mechanism to handle those frustrated customers without asking them to go here and there and wasting time. As I missed both my domestic connecting flights from AKL and CHC, had to purchase new tickets due to this delay.",0
No communication from the airline our flight was delayed. A text or phone call would have been nice so we could have arrived at the airport later. The check in agent was beyond rude and as unhelpful as possible. Told me I had to remove my laptop per TSA. I told her TSA allows laptops in checked bags and to please double check. She demanded I take it out and carry it on. She then takes my bag and slams it into the conveyor belt. Avoid this airline if at all possible.,0
Tried for the first time. We flew roundtrip form Riyadh to Bangkok Business Class. The lounge in Riyadh was no too bad but very crowded. The flight was delayed from Riyadh to Bangkok but it was made up by the warm and friendly staff. The service was excellent and so was the food. On our return trip to Riyadh we enjoyed the Serendib Lounge. They have great food and service.,1
"Malaga to Prestwick. The most uncomfortable flight I've flown for many a year. Very uncomfortable no seat adjustment no radio, tv or films. Also, my case was damaged in transit by Ryanair, but they only give you 6 days to complete their online Claim Form, which requires detailed pages of information, some of which I do not have so can go no further. So far I've tried 3 times with no success! I do believe this is a definite ploy to prevent folk from claiming. I shall never travel with Ryanair again!",0
Toronto to Phoenix flight on Rouge. Nice staff but rotten plane. Made my way to my aisle seat and found the middle seat was taken a very big man. He had the arm rest up because he had trouble sitting in the seat. I asked politely to put the arm rest down. He spilled over the arm rest into my seat. I could see he was very uncomfortable and now I was uncomfortable as I only had half my seat and leg room. Requested another seat with attendant but no other seats available. What a long 5 hours. What is Air Canada doing with these Rouge planes. Entertainment on iPads is terrible. Where did all the new movies go?,0
"Horrible service. You pay for seats and its not honored. Lots of confusion in the aircraft.  Actually had Flair attendants ask some passengers how they got on the aircraft when they had a clear. I was told by the check in attendant it was a window seat when it wasn't one., and when I complained, Flair claimed there was no record of any exchange to prove my claim.",0
"Boston to Bangkok via Doha. I found bathroom a bit larger then north American planes. Service was great. To be honest I only had less then hour after landing in Doha to catch the next flight to Bangkok, I could not believe it luggage arrived to. Great service. I really liked the flight crew member who did the announcements from Boston to Doha he was cheerful and you could hear him. The flight into Bangkok was different. He could give lessons on the announcements. But I would definitely recommend the airline, food good, service good I was impressed. Thanks for the great trip.",1
Really lovely team at Okayama who were so helpful and are a real credit to Korean Air. Thank you so much for all your help during our visit and in helping to sort out my luggage. The team were really kind and went beyond the call of duty.,1
We traveled from Bangkok to Tel Aviv and then a return flight 4 weeks later. Security was very thorough which we were happy with as it ensured a safe flight. Staff were efficient and friendly and the food was very good. I would definitely fly El Al again and recommend it to anyone flying to the region.,1
"Spend a little more and fly another airline. The seats are rock hard. No snacks, no tv, you pay a ton for assigned seats and baggage fees. I can handle all of those things for a short flight but checking in made this a no go for me. Instead of checking in online and printing your bag tags to just drop off, you have to stand in ridiculously long lines for them to do it for you. Makes zero sense when they have machines at the Atlanta airport. Every person I spoke with said that this was their first and last flight with frontier. I agree.",0
"When I booked my flight I was given the option to add a hotel which I did however when I went to check in at the hotel there was no confirmation for my stay. Allegiant charged me, sent me confirmation but the hotel did not have the confirmation and basically I was left no hotel and had to rebook directly from the hotel. I called Allegiant the day of and was on hold 3.5 hours since this was the day I flying I could not stay on hold. I have emailed them but have not heard back. Their chat is unavailable.  My flight was fine and I was able to confirm but if you want a package do not book it with them",0
"Very good company. I usually travel on the Asturias to Seville route with them and they always offer cheap prices, punctuality and good treatment from the crew. Highly recommended.",1
Flight from CDG to BKK economy seats were cramped and uncomfortable. Air France have gone for as many seats as possible even the cabin crew found it difficult to get the trolley through the very tight gangway. I will never fly Air France long haul economy again. Air France you need to revisit your seating plans.,0
I flew from Boston to Dallas Fort Worth. I have flown with Spirit Airlines before and have to say I wasn't overly impressed. This time however it was a completely different experience. Every member of staff I came across was wonderful to myself and my ten week old son. I was nervous about flying with such a young baby but the staff on flight 857 were all so lovely and helpful and made me feel so much better about traveling. The plane was clean and spacious and the whole flight went without a hitch.,1
JQ038 to Bali and Back. The seats were awful. They are so tight once the person in front reclines you have to recline your seat. We paid for all the extras the food was very limited so we had to buy food anyway they forgot our comfort pack and in fact we found later into the flight they gave it to someone else who hadn't paid for it. The entertainment was very limited and the sound quality was terrible. The staff were non existent and inattentive.,0
I am taking this airline weekly on short haul routes It's a no frills carrier but better than many standard ones back in Europe. New aircraft excellent smiling service on board cheap punctual comfortable and clean.,1
Just flew from Hong Kong to Seoul on the new 380 great plane great service. Then flew from Seoul to SFO in business class. Again great service food and wine. We will definitely fly with them again!,1
The worst business class flights we have ever had. Sloppy service the poorest food ever and served with some parts cold. I have had better service on EasyJet. I was served tea in a mug with the tea bag left in and no spoon to retrieve it or anywhere to put the sopping tea bag. I was served cheesecake with nothing to eat it with no spoon or fork. My breakfast that was the worst I have experienced on any airline was part warm part cold and partly hot I did not eat it and it stayed on my tray for over twenty minutes before a stewardess removed it. On my return flight from Delhi I was served cold chicken tikka. There was an empty seat opposite that was hot bedded by numerous people don't know who they were or where they came from. I wrote to Virgin 4 times before I got a response sloppy on the planes and sloppy after service.,0
"On staff at counter for check in, no information on gate, no information on boarding, boarding late, no explanation, airlines seem to for get the hundreds of people time, is not there time, this flight had no reason to not board on time aircraft has been at gate for hours. Really tired of airlines not really caring.",0
"Oakland to San Diego. I missed my flight and Robert from Southwest San Diego helped me get to my destination. He issued me a standby ticket, but later as I was waiting outside for a ride back home, he found me and handed me an actual ticket. He helped me during this difficult time and I am so grateful for him.",1
"Having purchased first class tickets for my wife and I to return to New Zealand in January we were very much looking forward to our return journey having booked business class on the outbound flights from New Zealand. The booking was made and fully paid for four months ago. I have been advised by curt email that I have been downgraded to business class, no mention of apology, explanation nor compensation or refund. It gets better, there seems no way of contacting Emirates in New Zealand their advertised phone number is cut off. What a shambles of an airline and we haven't even left the ground. This is how they treat premium paying clients, forget it. Book with another airline, never again!",0
"I'm reviewing on behalf of my friend who I was with through all the stress and money lost by dealing with Air Arabia. In all my years in the travel business I am shocked at the unprofessionalism and sheer lack of empathy for passenger. Their condition of contract and other important information is non existent. My friends arrived through Milan to Cairo on 3rd July. It should have been from Naples but Air Arabia cancelled. Email arrived telling them their flight for their departure was cancelled out of Sharm El Sheikh on the 31st July. Air Arabia offered to go back on the 17th August. Nobody in Sharjah contacted them. My question was how were my friends to survive for 17 days. Another email canceling the flight on the 17th August. Rang Sharm airport who advised that there were no flights coming in from air arabia at all. So looks like they sold the seats knowing they wouldn't be flying in or out of Sharm. My friends had to buy 2 tickets with Egyptair yesterday to get to Cairo to catch a flight. They have to stay in a hotel for 2 nights in Cairo, I had to lend them 2000 egyptian pounds. Through all this their visas had run out and on arrival today in Cairo they were told they would have to pay for the visa being out of date. Air Arabia had the cheek to charge them for the seat increases on the two cancelled flights. This is not a covid problem, this is disgraceful. I live in Egypt and I know AA are based in Sharjah but their agents in Cairo couldn't care less. I'm disgusted at the behavior.",0
"I traveled from Frankfurt to Chicago. In spite of being the only passenger the service was very poor. The flight attendant disappeared fast. Food was very poor and limited, more like Economy. There were no sanitizers in the bathroom.  My bags were last to arrive in O'Hare.",0
"The Customer Service for Qantas is just horrible. I have been flying with them for work for 9 year now and have had no issues in the past but there is no longer anyone who will answer your phone call. I tried to book 3 seat for my family to fly from MEL to LAX but as my son is under 2 years of age, they could not give him his own seat. I understand this but Qantas has the ability to book additional seats on flight for comfort reasons. I just wanted to make sure he was not sitting on our laps for 14 hours. They explain it on their website quite well. I was not sure how to properly enter this transaction code online so I thought a phone call would get this done properly. The Customer Service Rep was convinced my son needed to be booked for the bassinet seat but he does not qualify for this as he is over 18 months of age. I spent 90mins going back and forth trying to make the right booking and we ended on putting in a bassinet request with 2 tickets issued. I will not have to call back this week and try and speak to someone who knows what they are doing and get them to issue a third seat. Qantas is quickly regressing to the mean with their awful customer service via the phone. I can see why they are bleeding market share to someone like Rex on local routes with the premium they charge in price.",0
"Munich to Male via Doha in economy class. I had a really great experience with Qatar Airways. The flight was on time and staff is exceptional with excellent service. The flight from Doha to Male was even better, because there were less people and I had the exit row on my own. Qatar Airways is definitely one of the best airlines.",1
"First time flying with Saudi Arabian Airlines from Toronto to Abu Dhabi via Jeddah and Riyadh, returning back to Toronto via Jeddah A very good airline, excellent service and entertainment, food very tasty and good seats. There were no delays, excellent departures and landing. Price was very cheap",1
"Just prior to boarding time, announcement that the aircraft was experiencing technical issues and would be delayed. The delay ended up being 5 hours as the original issue couldn't be fixed and a new plane was required. The CX gate staff took a fair amount of grief from a few vociferous individuals during this time and whilst they could be criticised for not providing information in a timely manner and on occasion promising an update within 10 mins and not delivering that for 30 mins or so, CX should be complimented for how quickly they ended up getting us away. First off, no one should question an airline that delays departure because of a technical issue. Assuming it took an hour or so to determine that the fault could not be fixed, and a replacement aircraft required, it then took CX less than 4 hours to find that aircraft, ensure it was in operational condition, fuel it up, unload the previous aircraft, load up the new aircraft and no doubt complete copious amounts of paperwork. On top of this, a replacement pilot was required due to the restrictions on working hours. During the delay CX offered vouchers to cover an adequate snack and also provided complimentary bottles of water at the gate. The flight itself was fine although the crew did feel a little harried and not as relaxed as usual.",1
Bangkok to Melbourne. Attentive flight attendants with good service all the way. Food plentiful and tasty. Food was well presented and hot. Cabin attendants were cheerful and very pleasant. Seats were comfortable and enabled good rest especially between Brunei and Melbourne. Flights departed and arrived on time. Now my first choice for flights from Australia to Asia and beyond.,1
My son aged 10 flew to Colombia for the Summer with Avianca from London Heathrow to Medillin the check in service at Heathrow was very professional and my son was looked after from London to Bogota then a flight from Bogota to Medillin. I would recommend the Companion service with Avianca my son was not left on his own at any time until he go to his final destination. Avianca Well done on a professional service you have done yourselves proud I will be flying again with Avainca both me and my family.,1
"London to Manila via Abu Dhabi. Outbound leg to Abu Dhabi was fine, A380 is very pleasent. Quiet cabin, leg room ok, entertainment system great although films not as up to date as expected. Food reasonable and cabin crew excellent. Abu Dhabi to Manila on an older Boeing 777 so the entertainment system was a little more dated but ok, food and crew excellent. Return leg from Manila to Abu Dhabi was cancelled but put up in a nice hotel and kept reasonably well informed of when the return flight was going to be. I can't fault Etihad for a situation outside of their control. The only minor thing would be that luggage was not returned when it became obvious that the delay was going to be a long one.",1
"Munich to Lahore via Jeddah. 8 hours of delay. Delay is not the issue, they have written a rule on board that if your stay is more than 6 hours they will give you a hotel room. Now they are saying that the rooms are only for EU, American and Canadian passports. And they only give transit visa to EU, American and Canadian passports. Worst experience. No compensation. The terminal is poor. No place to eat. No KFC no McDonalds nothing.",0
I fly domestic and long haul with TAM and many other airlines at least twice a month with 3 or 4 flights each journey. Every flight I have had with TAM has been good. Nearly all cabin crew speak English and Spanish and the pilots announcements are always made in English and Portuguese. I don't know what other people expect. Some of the worst flights I have had have been with major carriers. TAM have courteous staff flexibility and level of service.,1
"I paid for a flight from Atlanta GA to Carlsbad NM. When I arrived at Boutique Air they said they didn't have time to get my luggage from American Airlines. The man at the front desk did not offer solutions he just barked statements about how I wasn't getting my luggage because they aren't flying to NM again until Sunday and there ""won't be room"" for our checked luggage. When my husband called American Airlines they show that Boutique Air signed for my luggage at 2.02pm so that man at the desk lied to me, they just didn't want to wait or they didn't want the weight. No one at Boutique Air is answering the phone. I'll never fly that little rinky dink plane again. I need my luggage or I'll continue to expand on this review.",0
"I am yet to find a reason for United Airlines still operating. They obviously hate passengers and the service shows. I booked tickets 1 month in advance and they would not give me seats. They block at least 30 seats and you have to pay more to get an assigned seats and the lowest payment from SEA to IAH was USD69. So on the day of travel, they did give me seats, but me and my wife had to sit 20 rows apart. The staff obviously hate their job or passengers or both. Forget about being helpful, they are downright rude. The best thing to do is not ask for anything and that includes water. ",0
"The flight got cancelled at the last minute and they didn't even have any other flights out to Tampa, Florida that day, the wait time was three days. Good thing Southwest had some flights. You're better off with Southwest airlines. If you want to have you're flight cancelled and your money taken then Spirit Airlines is the one for you.",0
"Only speaking English I was quite lost about what to do and where to go. I had trouble filling out the form which was in Chinese. Yushouyu came to my rescue. She was very knowledgeable, very efficient and took the initiative to help in many ways. Her English was quite good and she was excellent at her job.",1
"I was due to fly with SriLankan Airlines in April of this year, however, my flights were cancelled due to COVID19. Upon speaking to a customer service representative, I was told that I would be entitled to a full refund and that I just needed to apply online, which I did on 15 April. It has now been 4.5 months and I am still yet to receive a refund and have not received any response to my previous 3 requests for follow up. While I can appreciate this is a difficult time for all, it does not take almost 5 months to process a simple refund. This is not acceptable and reflects extremely poorly on SriLankan airlines, If this is how this airline treats it's customers, then I would certainly think twice before booking with this airline.",0
"They abandoned my 60 years old mother in the airport, they canceled the flight without warning or explanation, and therefore she lost the next connection. They don't answer any phones or chats, they didn't offer any change or refund, we had to go with another airline.",0
This by far was the worst experience I've ever had on a airline. Our plane from Edmonton to Toronto was 135 min late. The lady couldn't do a tag for our luggage to get switched at the swoop desk. This is new to me same airline multiple places should be able to switch luggage on a connecting flight. We landed I had less than 1 hour to switch luggage because Edmonton was unable to. The swoop check in bag person just looked at me said nothing I can do. So I guess it's acceptable as a airline to be 135 min late. Half the people on our plane missed flight to Vegas. I guess I'll have no clothes in Jamaica for a couple day's and that's all good for the people who work at swoop. Save yourself the hassle not the money don't fly swoop first experience was Terrible. Zero customer service zero help people just looking at me and making me feel stupid.,0
I flew from Montreal to Las Vegas in premium. Service was terrible and entertainment was even worse. If flight attendants make an announcement your Ipad freezes if the announcement is longer than 1 min you must restart the movie or show from the beginning. Very sad that Air Canada would attach their name to such poor service when people are so use to have great service on Air Canada.,0
Terceira to Lisbon cancelled in July 2019. They refuse to pay flight delay compensation mandated by EU law. Email answers from customer service take months. Very pretty islands and nice people but SATA is a disgrace for Azores.,0
Most worthless and horrible service. Boarding completed on time. Waited in tarmac 30 minutes for pushback. Flying crew say they have timed out. Relief crew not arrived even after 2 hours. Still stuck in the plane on the tarmac. Not even allowed to deplane or stretch our legs. Hungry as hell as well. Pathetic service . How do es Flair operate with such thin margin for duty time out?,0
The flights we made were above our expectations. The ground staff were friendly staff on board were extremely friendly the flights were on time. The aircraft was new and in excellent condition. Service onboard was excellent and the food on domestic flights was like the good old days in Europe. We flew economy and the leg room was excellent!,1
We traveled from JFK to Paris the flight was on time the staff more than friendly. Our baggage was over and didn't charge us a dime extra each of my 3 children were entertained by movies TV shows or music that was provided by individual screens. The food was nothing but typical airline food! Really what do you expect? Eat a good meal prior to your flight. We arrived on time as for as charging for water that is ludicrous! They walked around the entire time offering water! Our experience on the way back was exactly the same. Very satisfied. I would save the money and use it for your destination.,1
Almost everything is perfect. Flight from Bangkok to Doha was delayed for 2 hours but on chekin we were offered food vouchers. Great experience over all. Definitely will choose again to fly with Qatar Airways.,1
"Seattle to Phoenix. As a first time Delta flyer, I was nervous because of bad reviews I've seen. But in reality, the airline was great. From the gate person to the customer service, all was excellent. The only bad thing was that I got off with sore knees because economy is not very accommodating for anyone above 5 foot 6. So if you're above average height, you may want to save up for First Class for that extra leg room. But otherwise, Delta was great!",1
Never flying with them again. My partner and I have been up since 330 am to 1am. They took us off our flight while on our flight to Calgary. We now have to find a way to Edmonton without a car or a way back home to B.C. First flight was canceled due to weather at 6.05am. Second flight was delayed from 1pm to 5pm then we arrived at 630 and found we can't even get to Edmonton. Its now 9pm no flight until tomorrow am at 10am. All I have to say is don't do it don't waste money or time dealing with them.,0
"Flew Malaysia Airlines from Kuala Lumpur to Auckland. Paid to be upgraded to Business Class. The check in was pleasant and the lounge was good. Boarding at KLIA via separate entry. The satay was the one of the best, there was so much that you could have multiple servings. I was already full when the western appetizers of Prawn Cocktail were offered. Well presented and tasty. The main course was filet mignon which was tender and moist. The seat reclined to fully flat and I slept most of the flight. Not the best bed seat I've had but it did the job. For breakfast I had red tomato chilli chicken rice. Very moist and well balanced.",1
"3rd time flying this airline. Sits on the runway 15 minutes after real departure time, arrives 30 minutes after scheduled arrival time. I wouldn't recommend to anyone who wants to meet a timeline.",0
Flew from Toronto Pearson to Milan Malpensa direct. I must say I have no complaints whatsoever ok the food was average but its airline food so why complain. The whole experience was pleasant.,1
"Medellin to Cartagena. The flight was on time, the staff was friendly, even the service hotline tried to help me when I was delayed on my way to the airport. They offered free drinks on the fligt",1
"Beirut to Chicago via Doha. The overall experience was amazing, staff are extremely helpful and friendly, I would recommend flying with Qatar airways for anyone who is looking for a smooth and luxurious experience.",1
"Los Angeles to Medford. Horrible service at boarding in LA, in Medford the boarding crew was excellent. Planes are garbage, it's like being on a Schoolbus with wings. With added fees for carry on bags, for a little more you can fly a better carriers. This will be the last time I fly Allegiant.",0
"Legroom comfortable, cabin very quiet and LED lighting gives a great feel. Charging and USB socket on every seat very helpful. The crew were smiling and courteous, and food extremely good. Best service to date with Air India, except for the immigrations and customs in Delhi which could be done directly in Bangalore.",1
MEL to AUH. Flight was late leaving with no explanation. The seat was very uncomfortable being hard and with no support at all. There were no headphones for the inflight AV so this needed to be requested. The sound quality from the headphones was distorted with high pitched noises making listening to anything unpleasant. The flight attendant took orders for dinner which served after midnight local time. The meal was adequate but nothing unusual or noteworthy. After dinner that was the last I saw of any flight attendant until breakfast was served many hours later. For some reason I was overlooked by the flight attendant and received no breakfast in fact I was not even asked if I wanted coffee or water. This would be unacceptable in economy class and certainly is so in business class. The flight attendant did speak to me when he wanted to sell me tax free goods from the catalogue. I will not be booking Etihad again.,0
Casablanca to New York. Our Entertainment system did not work for the 8 hour flight. We could not even turn on the overhead light to read. The staff argued with us.,0
"Kuala Lumpur to Melbourne. The flight was very good and service was excellent. There was a stewardess who was pleasant, energetic and excellent in her service. On my return on the same airline, the crew was ok but not to the standard of the previous staff.",1
"I was travelling with my husband from Cairo to London via Istanbul. We went through very long checking because we came from African country and we missed our plane from Istanbul to London. We had to buy new tickets on our own and the ticket services guy was extremely rude he said to us It is your countries fault not mine "". It was the worst trip on my life, I will never repeat this experience and I don't recommend them for anyone.",0
"Cancelled inbound flight 10 hours before take off, no support at airport and impossible to get hold of anyone. Managed to book on a flight 2 days later. 3 months on still waiting for compensation and reimbursement. No communication still and even harder to talk to anyone. The ADR won't do anything until a final decision has been issued, the industry need to have better controls in place for disgraceful companies like this. Do not fly Wizz!",0
"San Francisco to Istanbul. Flying with Turkish is a nightmare. Customer service is so poor that you have never experienced it anywhere. Food and drinks are super low quality. Crews are lost and bathrooms are not even usable because of how dirty they are the staff at the gate, can get your reward number but add your points some other account. Online customer service is amazingly rude and useless and cant even talk English. I don't know why they have the job! Do your self a favor and skip this airline. Turkish Airline is all spam.",0
"Cancelled the flight from La Guardia to Chicago at 4am in the morning. Flight was at 9am. Worst decision to go with Spirit Airlines, and I can only blame on myself for trying to save 50USD. Now I am paying 160USD extra to get a flight back on the same day with American Airlines. Spirit offered me a flight the next day at 9pm. That is a 36 hr delay.",0
"Terrible! Absolutely terrible! Do not fly this airline. They're extremely rude, spoke down to both my wife and I, did nothing to fix the fact they were late upon arrival which made me miss my connection flight so I had to pay out of pocket a crazy amount of money for a hotel and taxis. The manager at Newark airport has no idea how to perform a good guest experience. And all you get when you try to contact their customer is service is ""we're very sorry."" That does nothing for me and my scenario. Do yourself a favor and fly any other airline you can no matter how much more it costs, I promise you'll be better off. Aer Lingus is the absolute worst airline I've ever flown with.",0
Manila to Singapore. Flight was fine but booked 3 premium economy seats. At check in they couldn't honor our seats so I applied for a refund of the seat upgrade online. They agreed to refund my credit card but that was 30 days ago. They are holding my money and seem to be very slow about issuing my refund. Based on this horrible customer service I will not be a customer in the future.,0
"We bought a return flight between Guangzhou and Nairobi, while from Guangzhou to Nairobi is via Hanoi and from Nairobi to Guangzhou is via Bangkok. When we were checking in just now for our flight back to Guangzhou, we confirmed our destination with the staff, but they still gave us boarding passes which said from Nairobi to Bangkok. But for my asking the airline desk later when we got into the waiting area, we wouldn't even know that we still need boarding passes from Bangkok to Guangzhou and things would be even more troublesome if I hadn't asked. Never seen a via flight that requires 2 boarding passes for a person, each for a sector of the flight! When we flew from Guangzhou to Nairobi, it was only one boarding pass per person. More bizarrely, we are placed in different seats these two sectors, which means we will still have to change seats when we arrive in Bangkok! Moreover, flight service is mediocre. Avoid at all cost.",0
Worst airline and worst customer support. The customer service is rude and they never work towards a solution. They always find excuses for the airline and imply that the airline is never responsible for anything.,0
Varanasi to Delhi. The worst customer experience I could imagine. Flight G8144 stranded at Varanasi airport due to bad weather conditions in Delhi for the last 8 hours. No official at the Varanasi Airport to hear the grievances. No time given to the passengers for the next flight. Passengers left at the airport without any confirmation and no one is there to attend.,0
"Riga to Zurich. I had a carry on luggage of 8kg and bought 3kg of duty free goods at Riga airport. They weighed everything combined and had to take away my luggage and charge me 60 euros as the weight exceeded 8kg. There is no free water served on these flights.  A disgrace of a company, to be avoided at all cost!",0
Flying from Paris to Odessa via Prague everything went particularly well. Flights were on time the crew was helpful and polite and I got my luggage without any problems. Furthermore the price was very cheap despite I booked my tickets less than a month before departure.,1
"La Paz to London Heathrow via Miami with American Airlines. This was the worst journey ever. Disgusting staff attitude, no personal TV and terrible food. Missed our connection in Miami but their staff couldn't care less. It took us hours to get them to work with us and give us somewhere to stay overnight. We were told we missed the connection due to bad weather conditions, and apparently bad weather conditions is the fault of the passenger! Most ridiculous thing I have ever heard. Cabin crew just seemed like they couldnt be bothered and were rolling their eyes at passengers, signing loudly and treated us very badly. Two staff members even had an argument in front of passengers. So unprofessional. Never fly with American Airlines, they make your journeys thoroughly unpleasant.",0
Travelled from Seattle to Stockholm and back via KEF. Planes are fine service is fine food and drink are exactly what you get these days on any airline. Entertainment system is better than most competitors. KEF is a small airport and they don't call out gate announcements so you need to pay attention. That isn't Icelandair's fault. I travel extensively and would use Icelandair again in a heartbeat. My only issue is that they cancelled their partner program with Alaska so I didn't get any points!,1
Premium Economy London to New York 1st June 2013. This is a clever concept by Virgin it is marketed as business its not but the next step up is hugely more expensive. So you are getting a little more than economy but paying nearly business class fares. If you were unlucky as I was and get seats near the barrier they do not give you the legroom as the other premium economy seats do so you lose out just that little bit more. The food and seat comfort were ok but nothing special the entertainment was adequate. What really prompts me to write this review is the service. A passenger who having made a perfectly polite request for a diet coke who has to make it again after ten minutes because it still has not arrived should get attitude form the cabin staff. I don't expect sulking and glaring and flouncing off from professional air crew! Worse on the return flight five days later one of the male members of aircrew who clearly loved his own voice far too much was never off the public address system. It seemed to be used as a platform for his self promotion and to show off to passengers who just want to be left alone. If the Captain could hear what was going on I was disappointed he or she did not put a stop to it. Its not entertaining and most of all annoying when one is trying to watch a film. I won't fly with Virgin again.,0
"Dallas to Savannah. American cancelled our flight during a mandatory evacuation during hurricane Irma. Which left us completely stranded. They rescheduled it for the day the hurricane was supposed to hit this area, which makes no sense. Even if there hadn't been a hurricane, this would have been bad news because they changed the flight from a Sunday to a Monday. I scheduled a Sunday return flight because I work on Mondays, like most people. I called their customer service and they were no help. Luckily Southwest stepped in and was able to book us a flight out of harm's way. It blows my mind that they would do that.",0
First and last time flying with this airline. Upon booking they advised that we can pay for extra baggage online at a cheaper rate. Tried to do so many times before checking and on same day as flight. After trying to pay multiple times I kept receiving an error from their website. After calling customer care they advised me to pay at checkin at the airport. When we got to the airport they knew the online prices were cheaper without us even explaining anything to them and explained how neither the customer service or check in can do anything about the price. So instead of paying 12 euros online we ended up getting charged 40 euros per baggage which ended up being more expensive than the flight itself. Never again.,0
Never again. We booked to travel from Manchester to Orlando. The aircraft in both directions was old cramped and uncomfortable. The temperature of the cabin was inconsistent. The entertainment was rubbish no seat back TVs which have always been a standard for all international flights that we have travelled on. The aisle TVs could not be seen from window seats which was pointless and dark sections of the movie could not be seen at all. Food was terrible my salad arrived uncovered and food was average. Ground crew were frantically trying to get people to give up seats flight was overbooked with many families not sitting together and children split from their parents on the flight! AA was not much cheaper than my other flight options. Avoid travelling with them!,0
"Flight from Miami to Boston at the end of January did anyone else test positive for COVID? I am ashamed of this airline, I will never fly with them again. Absolutely no social distancing on this flight. Every single seat was taken, I am disgusted. Not to mention our flight was delayed yet again due to the plane being unfit to fly seeing that this is a trend with this airline inconveniencing every single person on this flight. Disgrace. Never again. Will never fly this airline again.",0
I have been flying for years. This is one of the first times I have chosen to fly with United airlines. Worst experience I have ever had with an airline. Our flight was delayed in Honolulu to san Francisco so we missed our connecting flight. Then they booked us 24 hrs later. That was a problem we both had to work on Monday. So they had another flight that was earlier but to new jersey still put us late on Sunday to arrive in Cleveland. We ended up staying at the airport so we didn't miss our next flight.,0
"I rode 4 time with this airline, each time it was delayed. The last time it was delayed was to wait for 3 employees who were not even working on the airline. We waited 45 minutes for them. The other times they were delayed at least 2 hours. Extremely inconvenient. If I have a choice I will never fly with Delta Air Lines.",0
"The worst airport and plane experience I've ever had. Very rude, and tried making you pay for everything. Most didn't even know their job. Had to keep getting different tickets because the first ones given to us were no good. Waiting on tarmac 30 minutes or better, because they had no place for us to go. The great deal turned into your worst nightmare. Don't waste your money there, go elsewhere and enjoy your flight.",0
LS888 on 29th March. On the return leg of a weekend in Prague back to Manchester after having a significant delay on the way out we feared the worst but the plane was only marginally delayed setting off and then only slightly further delayed by strong head winds. The plane was 16 years old but had only been brought by Jet2 in January of this year so was smart and clean on the inside though I found the seats fairly narrow and uncomfortable. We felt the cabin crew were unprofessional they gossiped openly in front of us about how they had all been out until 5am that morning partying. They carried out the safety briefing with a look of extreme boredom in the end. Throughout the flight they spoke on the internal phone and every time they replaced it they slammed it with great force making a huge bang which after numerous occasions was very wearing. I felt the noisy announcements and attempts to sell were misplaced on an evening flight. Other than that the flight was okay but as usual Jet2 sold out of sandwiches and toasties. Plus we only had euros to hand and the exchange rate was daylight robbery. Two hot drinks and one Twix converted at 9 euros. Ouch. Unfortunately our English money was in the hand luggage which was of course nowhere near our seats. A man a couple of rows back from us was allowed to board the plane with four separate pieces of hand luggage filling an entire overhead bin. Why Jet2 cannot be stricter about hand luggage sizes and number of pieces I cannot understand. Towards the end of boarding all hand luggage had to be checked as so little space was left. Frankly it was all a bit shambolic and like the attitude of the cabin crew did not instil any confidence.,0
"I am currently stuck in Vancouver and was unable to continue my onward journey, even though I was issued my boarding passes to my final destination, because as I have been told by the agents here in Vancouver, there was an the airline made an error with my ticket and your agents in Edmonton knew about it and should never have let me fly in the first place, I am now having to sleep in Vancouver before proceeding to travel for more than 48 hours for a journey that should have taken about 18 hours, missing out family events and income. This is highly unacceptable and should have be caught, had you employed competent individuals.",0
"Riga to London Luton. We can understand delays, problems happen but we cannot certainly tolerate customer abuse. I found it insulting after an 8 hour delay being given vouchers of 4 euros for ""refreshments"" and knowing that a simple sandwich cost double than that. Also there was a obvious lack of communication with the passengers, no even providing assistance on calls and help people with needs. For me was an awful experience and I will try to avoid Wizz Air on the future.",0
Our flight was cancelled last minute. They kept us waiting in the terminal for 2 hours before finally cancelling. They tried to rebook us on a flight from Boston to Dublin and then to Barcelona from there. The email they sent the rebooking information on was in Spanish with no English translation. There was also no option to check into the flight or any information about how to access the flight online or cancel it. At this point I would only have 2 days left in Barcelona which was not worth it to me. When I tried to get a refund customer service was unhelpful and told me to call the airline that they rebooked us to. They made no effort to help and had no further communication with us. It felt like they were trying to push our problems with them onto another airline to avoid us.,0
"Poor aircraft facilities, limited entertainment, poor menu choice, quality of food poor, crown lounge not open. Having travelled outward with Air France to Beijing, the comparison with China Southern for the return leg was stark. To start things off, the faulty entertainment socket was bad enough. But then to inconvenience the poor unfortunate passengers next to me through the comings and goings of various CS staff trying to fix the socket was both distracting and embarrassing for me. Then to compound matters, they get a passenger to swap seats with me and low and behold, the tray table will not go back into the seat and I forced to sit for some of the journey with this as well. Overall, very poor business class service.",0
"Worst experience ever. I will never fly on Spirit again. They don't give any explanation for flights cancellation and don't have the needed staff to help. We had our flights cancelled twice. We hope we can get a full refund without any inconvenience since it was not us who canceled. Don't ever get a cheap flight again, specifically from Spirit, you will regret it.",0
"Seattle to Kansas City. Couldn't check in on their app or online, they had network issues. Got in the airport 45 mins before my flight, went to the service desk and they were locked out of checking in. The lady there took me to the supervisor, who was very rude, she said it's not her problem that they had network issues and asked if I read the customer agreement that says I should call customer service in case of network issues. All in all they kept me waiting for 30 mins that I could have made it to the gates and charged me again to rebook a flight.",0
"Columbus to Tampa. The most uncomfortable seats ever. They are very hard and did not recline. They were so narrow, I had to lean into the window and my wife leaned into me. Comparedly, we flew 2 weeks later on AA on the same A320. Seats had a little padding, they reclined, and were 3 inches wider. We had more than enough room. We will never fly Spirit again. Because of this, we won't try any other discount airline.",0
I would never recommend Spirit Airlines. My sister's flight from Atlanta to Chicago was delayed in Atlanta. She actually sat on the runway for over an hour while her connecting flight from Ft. Lauderdale left on time. Spirit knew she would miss her connecting flight and still allowed her to go to Ft. Lauderdale. They then only offered to put her on the next flight at 7 am the next morning. If cheap is what you want do yourself a favor take a bus.,0
"The flight was alright, on time and service during the flight was good. However, afterwards, communication with their customer support was the worst experience ever! Simply the customer team brings shame to the company and I don't know if they have any supervisor over their team. I asked for simple request but they refer each time new email or refuse to work via phone call and simply don't get the work done. So I'd not recommend anyone to use this airline as you are highly likely to engage with this terrible customer support team!",0
"We had a horrible experience on a Malindo Air flight to Kathmandu from Kuala Lumpur. Our flight was already scheduled as delayed 4 hours before the departure. We were asked to get into the gate lounge, waiting to be boarded on the flight. We waited more than 1 hr in the waiting room and nobody gave us a reason for the delay. The airport operators, just informed us that they tried to do their best not to cancel our flight and it was the only one off to Kathmandu that day. Any kind of information or refreshment were not offered to us. Almost all passengers were furious and the airport staff contacted a Malindo representative officer. We started to be boarded when the Malindo crew appeared, apparently, the aircraft was ready, but the airline didn't have any cabin crew. With more than 4 hours of delay, without being offered a glass of water or being allowed to get out of the waiting hall, the boarding started. A passenger asked for some water and suddenly, a cabin crew member started shouting out and quarreling with the passenger. The plane took off quickly, the only 2 sentences that came from the cockpit throughout the whole flight were ""cabin crew be seated for takeoff"" and ""and cabin crew be seated for landing"". Any information regarding safety, to fasten seat belts, weather, destination, delay, timezone, take off, the landing was provided by the captain. It was my worst experience ever.",0
"Dubai to Moscow. Emirates is the worst airline in the world. Food onboard I have not seen worse. Flight delayed for several hours. Employees of the airline at the counter at Dubai Airport behave rudely, refuse to comply with international flight rules.",0
"I had a very bad and bitter experience with the staff of KLM Dutch Airlines which flew from Delhi to Amsterdam.  I carried a few extra kgs than allowed by the airline, and they charged heavily.",0
Doha to Colombo. Plane was a B777 and appeared to be almost new. Flight was 20 minutes late being pushed back and then we spent 30 minutes riding round the airfield no announcement why we were delayed. Business class only half full so service was excellent. Food offered was uninspiring but drinks were good and were refilled regularly. No comfort pack supplied on this flight. Seats were very comfortable and the 777 is in my opinion better than the A330.,1
Flew Bhopal to Mumbai with Air India. Kindly understand the value of time of people! Flight was delayed by 30mins from its scheduled time. Luggage took 25 mins to be on belt. Belt number wasn't mentioned on flight itself which normally other flights do! No value of time of other people. I missed a connecting train which was an hour later because of this.,0
"As tourists from the USA, my partner and I were flying with Lufthansa in Business Class. Even though the Bodrum Airport lounge was open, we were informed that Lufthansa has cancelled contracts with some lounges. Therefore, we could not enter the lounge at our departure airport. European business class is a regular class seat with the middle seat kept free. No onboard entertainment was offered. Flight time was 2.5 hours so I expected a little bit more than just one tray of food. No champagne was offered before the flight.",0
BNE to SIN via KUL. Excellent flight. The business cabin in the new A330 is really good and the crew is very accommodating. The satay is also extremely delicious. The 15.4 inch AVOD screen also had a good selection of movies. The amenity kit was the star of the evening. It had everything you could think and couldn't think of.,1
Lufthansa Senator lounge in Frankfurt good. The cabin was very clean and excellent staff and service. Catering out of FRA can be iffy at times but was spot on for this flight. IFE good with plenty of choices. Amenity kit is ok. I think that SQ is as close to perfect as is possible. Have tried many others but not found them up to Singapore Airlines standard.,1
"Jakarta to Yangon via Kuala Lumpur. I was flying to Yangon transit in Kuala Lumpur for my best friend wedding and they leave my luggage in  Kuala Lumpur, and the staff don't want to help. What kind of airline who does that! They even said that they cannot help at all.",0
Khon Kaen to Bangkok. Good service from staff and a nice snack. Cleanliness and nice service onboard. Free luggage loaded. Comfortable seat and room for legs.,1
"On a previous trip from Columbus to Chicago, my flight was delayed twice and then rebooked for the next day. A trip the following month, my flight was delayed two hours, leaving passengers on the flight for an hour in their seats, first due to paperwork for maintenance that wasn't completed, then due to crew needing a break. I was hesitant to fly American again for my trip in November, but booked anyways giving it another chance. Arriving to the airport and waiting at my gate, the time came for boarding and my flight wasn't on the screen. I checked and the gate had been switched. I went to the new gate and they told me my gate was changed again. I went to the new gate again and they said that my flight was at the old gate, but that it had been delayed by an hour and a half without any reason. Now, arriving to the airport for my return flight, knowing it was going to be delayed, I found out it was in fact delayed again by an hour. I refuse to fly American Airlines again.",0
My granddaughters will be flying from Alaska to Boston with their mother. We were unable to choose seats when we booked online. I called and asked for a call back. They promised within 20 minutes. 1 and half hours later they would not allow us to make sure the 5 and 12 year olds could not sit with their mother. Argumentative and rude customer service!!!! We have to wait and hope we can get seats together 24 hours before their flight. Unacceptable.,0
Toronto to Manchester. Great flight excellent service on board and at the desk. Attendants were helpful and kind to us old couple. The only thing was the seat cushions were VERY uncomfortable.,1
Bangkok to Phnom Penh. Very nice flight early in the day. It was a short flight but they still provided a tasty hot chicken curry and noodles snack. I also appeciated the flight attendant at the cabin door with a hand sanitizer dispenser. Bags arrived quickly on arrival. I will fly again with Thai Smile Airways.,1
Gold Coast to Kuala Lumpur was an eight hour flight. Boarding was orderly. Announcements were few. It was a bit cramped in my row. I had a meal which was nice. I will fly them again as they do great job.,1
"Orlando to Islip. The crew was amazing. They worked well together, had a smile on their face and were personable. Was my first time flying Frontier Airlines and I definitely will be back.",1
"An awful airline. A 5 hour delays, no compensation and not even a reply from their customer service.  I flew from Paris with the flight on February 8th to Bangkok with a stop in Bahrain. I learned when landing in Bahrain that the flight to Bangkok GF152Y was delayed by 5 hours. I hardly received any excuse from the staff, the customer service never answered my emails and I had no compensation at all. I stayed 7 hours in the terrible Bahrain airport in the middle of the night, had nothing to drink nor eat.",0
Amman to Aqaba on Embraer175. Served a full hot meal tea coffee and water on this very short 40 minute flight. The 3 flight attendants were very helpful. The leather seats were comfortable and the flight was only half full so I was lucky to have an empty seat next to me. RJ has improved tremendously lately and I really hope they stay this way.,1
Will use this airline again when travelling in the US. We flew San Diego to Las Vegas and SW was the only one that offered a direct flight at less than half the price and as a family of 7 we got to sit together. The flight attendants were very friendly.,1
An awful flight experience for me. I flew from Las Vegas to Philadelphia and we were delayed. The announcement explained that the delay was waiting for the flight attendants. I shouldn't complain though because while waiting in the terminal other Spirit airlines flights were being canceled all over the place. When we finally boarded the plane it was pretty dirty. The seats had graffiti everywhere and there was still trash from previous flights scattered all over the place. The flight attendants were obnoxious during the flight they did nothing but sit in their seats and play games on each others phones. Regardless of the money you save by booking with Spirit the bag fees are extremely expensive and you have to pay for everything once inflight. I would recommend eating before boarding. I actually wouldn't even recommend boarding. Almost every flight they had that day was delayed or canceled. And if you have luxury of needing to speak with customer service expect a worst case scenario for your travel arrangements.,0
JFK to DUS. Great flight. 8 hour trip non stop great entertainment and staff service was excellent.,1
"Flying on one ticket with my wife, but our seats were 10 rows apart. No way to fix it with ground staff at Tel Aviv airport.",0
Worst lost luggage service you can expect. The airline only delivered my luggage halfway and I had to travel for one week without a baby stroller let alone spare clothes. I understand these things can happen but I do not expect it to take more than 1 month to get the luggage delivered to my home address. It took the airline 3 weeks to locate whereabouts of my luggage and now its saying I need to organize with the airport to get the bags sent to my home address which is located in another city. What is even worse is their customer support. You cannot be put through to the case manager only they can reach you but they never managed to dial my number correctly. When you call customer support minimum wait time is 30mins and they cannot provide any solutions as they are not authorized. All in all will never fly with Jetstar again.,0
Well what to say a single Business Class flight to JFK from Dublin. Ordinarily I would hate such flights but the price and nature of the Aer Lingus flight was exceptional the cabin crew were dedicated and tended to my every need providing a friendly a fun flight to New York. The seats were very comfortable and I was greeted with champagne upon arrival the inflight entertainment was highly varied with some real classic films as well as many block buster movies and TV shows. The flight departed on time. The only slight drawback currently is the fact the seats do not lie completely flat that being said you still have more than enough room to relax. When I raised this with staff they discussed how their will apparently soon be changes made to put in place those seats that do lie completely flat as other airlines have begun to put them into place. Overall the flight was incredibly relaxing and I would book long haul with Aer Lingus in a heartbeat for flying out of Dublin the service is exceptional and business class was an unforgettable experience.,1
"Edinburgh to Luxembourg. I have had problems with Ryanair multiple times before. First problem appeared when some of our wedding guests were not able to show at the ceremony as Ryanair suddenly changed the flight dates. Another time we paid for priority boarding. We crossed the gate amongst the priority passengers. Instead of letting priority passengers enter the plane first and then admit other passengers on the board they let everyone pass at the same time. Then today on our flight to Luxembourg we arrived 2 hours before the flight, scanned our passes through security and waited 100 meters from the gate. 30 minutes before the flight we approached the gate. There were no passengers left, only the staff. Then we were told we were two minutes late at the gate and they already deleted us from the passenger list so we won't be able to get on that flight. Staff were very rude and not helpful at all. Never in my life have I experienced such terrible customer service. Usually the boarding doesn't finish up until just before departure! There was no final call announced for the flight, our names were not called! The staff were awful and the only thing they could say was ""you won't get on that plane"". They expect customers to pay all these extras for seating together, cabin luggage, I won't be surprised if they start charging for using a toilet during the flight! But when it comes to be understanding to customers who pay money for the service, they just do not care. I would understand if we had been late and the plane had been starting the engines and preparing for departure, but we could actually see people still entering the plane from the window! So we did not go to our holiday and lost a lot of money. Thank you Ryanair for ruining our holiday! I will never use Ryanair again!",0
"American Airlines has ignorant, zero empathy gate agents. I have anxiety on losing luggage because I had lost my luggage twice prior. At boarding gate I tried to explain that to the two gate agents and wait to board last. When being asked if no over head bin space left would I agree to check bag. I did agree. When walking to my seat I found space left in the over head bin. I asked to have my carry on stored there but was refused. The senior Gate agent went up to the plane with a completely stone face and say no because you want to store your bag that means we have to keep your bag there with absolutely no empathy for my anxiety. She seemed to enjoy watching my anxiety kicks.",0
"Despite having corresponded with the French Embassy in New Orleans prior to my flight to assure I had all the proper documents to fly during the pandemic this staff at the gate of the second leg of my trip refused to let me on the plane on the basis of ""that's not a reason to go to France"". I was going to meet my wife in Paris who just got her visa for the US and she was flying in from South Africa. I had two one way tickets, one going was United, return was Delta. I was to meet her in the international terminal then get on the plane back to the states with her. Now she has to navigate international travel by herself and I was left stranded in New Jersey because the gate people wouldn't even look at the email I had from the french embassy stating that all I needed to do was fill out the International Travel Doc to mainland France. They kept telling me I needed a COVID test, I said I don't need it, it states here in the email that I don't need it for just traveling through the airport. But I also informed them I have a test anyway but they still refused to look at it or reason with me telling me I need to prove my relationship with my wife. They refused to look at any if the paperwork I had including all my flight itineraries after I told them I was just meeting my wife in the airport and flying back on the basis of ""that's not a reason to go to Paris"". United Airlines will never get my business again as their staff are the most incompetent of any airline I have ever flown on.",0
"The aircraft had electrical, engine problems while we were on board so it was delayed over 3 hours from the original flight time. It was a total nightmare! The seats was so cramped, no leg room, very old aircraft that makes a squeaky noise every time someone makes small movements in their seats. It was full when we are still in this covid situation. Terrible experience! I will never ever use this airline again.",0
I have flown a few times with Swiss between London City and Geneva or Zurich. Each time we have flown on time and landed early. The little wrapped chocolates give a welcomed finishing touch to every flight. Their crews and pilots always look smart and are always on the job. The flights are efficient spacious and stylish. I have recommended this airline to many people.,1
"The seats were so congested and they barely had any leg room. The front pockets on the seats were torn so everything would fall down. Twice I had seats where the push back button wasn't working so I could not move my seats a little behind to rest my head. We just got a little decent food once both ways.  I asked for coffee, I rang the bell and the attendant came but never came back. My mother asked for coffee once and she got it but we had to call the attendant back because he forgot to give us creamer and sugar. Entertainment wise there wasn't any good collection of movies. I guess since they charge less, you get get cheap service.",0
Krakow to New York JFK via Oslo. Was at check in 45 minutes before the flight and told by agent the flight was closed. Refused to give me boarding pass and told me to talk to her supervisor at another check in. Could not find her supervisor.  Airline refused to help and would not rebook or refund me the cost of the flight.,0
"Don't do it. I've flown a lot and Spirit is awful, never been so upset traveling. Our flight was canceled last minute, had to wait a full 24 hours to get to our destination and were not given a hotel or anything. Then we finally get to our destination and one of our checked bags was not put on the plane so now we're delayed even further trying to find our bag. Also all staff we experienced was rude and unhelpful. Never flying Spirit again.",0
Delhi to Kathmandu. I have travelled many times with Jet and always had a perfectly fine experience. On this occasion I received even better service than usual. The staff serving me was exceptionally friendly and helpful. She noticed I hadn't eaten much and went off to find me an alternative without me asking. Comfortable and easy flight.,1
Stranded in the lounge because I wasn't allocated a seat. This for a flight that I booked months ago. I didn't want to use them but was forced to because Emirates wasn't available. I advise travelers to shun them too and look for more customer friendly options.,0
"The airline canceled my flight from Porto to Milan. I had another flight scheduled from Milan Malpensa to Brindisi the next day, which I also missed due to their irresponsibility. I tried several times to ask for a refund of the amount paid, and until today, 7 months later, they still haven't paid. Never fly on that airline.",0
"Would not fly with them again. Delays on the aircraft are unacceptable. Putting you on a plane and then having you wait for over two hours before take off, that is disrespectful. And having it happen on both flights from Tel Aviv to London shows a pattern. For sure this is the last time I ever fly with easyJet.",0
The airline canceled and changed flights without even sending a notification. Customer service was extremely rude both over the phone and at the airport. Seats that were purchased and assigned for changed without my consent and I ended up with the worst seats on the plane. Horrible service all around.,0
"Vancouver to Beijing via Hong Kong. Hong Kong Airlines is the worst airline to book flights with because they regularly cancel their flights and do not care about what passengers have booked with them. I booked a flight in Sept of this year for travel in March and Hong Kong Airlines cancelled our flights to HK and Beijing right off costing me additional costs to make changes to our hotels. At the end, they offered me a full refund 3 months prior to departure when I had booked my flights 6 months prior, and their CS did not even bother to look up any other reasonable flight changes with other partner airlines to make my original arrival and departure dates work. I told them the reason I booked my flights in advance was to get the travel plans fully secured on exact dates and offering me a refund now would be useless as it would be impossible for me to find similar flights now. The CS did not seem to give a damn! Do not fly with them!",0
"Stockholm to Belgrade. The worst airline. I would recommend everyone avoid it if they can. Today my brother was supposed to return to Serbia with that company, but he couldn't because they sold his ticket. I was told that because he did not use the incoming ticket, so he automatically canceled the return ticket. Otherwise, he found out an hour before the flight, and in the meantime, emails were arriving to upgrade the flight with bigger luggage.",0
I bought the flight ticket for Christmas with protection of Wizz Flex but had to cancel it due to Covid. Wizz Flex allowed me to have a full refund but we started to be in lockdown so I did not even think to fly or even book a flight anywhere. I felt unsafe to fly. Recently I check my Wizz Air account and realized that my funds are expected and they actually expired today so I contacted Wizz Air thinking that due to Covid they will give me my money back and I will have longer time to buy a ticket as we are in UK lockdown but it did not happened so I lost money and I was late a few hours maybe. I think it's extremely unfair. How someone can use money and buy a ticket if flying is actually not safe during Covid?,0
"I have just completed a trip from Perth to Singapore and Hong Kong with Singapore Airlines and would like to say what a pleasure it was and the service was faultless. Particular thanks to the crew on our Singapore to Hong Kong flight on the 20th September at 1pm. the cabin crew were amazing in recovering some property that I had left on the previous aircraft and managed to deliver it to my seat before take off. The meals were lovely and cabin crew were fantastic with the children. Thank you for amazing flights and service, will definitely fly with them again.",1
"I would not recommend Air Canada Rouge to anyone. To start my trip I signed up for notification for cancelled or delayed flight. I got nothing but find myself sitting at the airport with a 3 hour delay. No problem, delays happen. When we were getting ready to finally board they were over booked and had to sort out that issue. I booked an early flight so I would have an extra day in Vegas. That was blown. Flight home surprise agian delay. Smaller this time but still delayed. Now when we finally land we have been at the airport for 20 min but are still sitting on the plane because there is no room for us to park. I am currently still on the run tarmac sitting in a very hot plane. This is my first and last flight with Air Canada Rouge. ",0
Hamilton to Las Vegas. After reading reviews let's just say I was worried about flying with Swoop. My experience with Swoop was wonderful. I have no complaints and I will definitely fly them again.,1
I flew the Mumbai to London sector on jet in First Class. I booked in business class but they overbooked my flight to Mumbai so I got upgraded. The first class suite on the 777 is pretty good although not all good as the suites in emirates Singapore airlines Etihad or American airlines. But overall good. The seat goes to a full 180 degree bed. Very comfortable. The staff is very helpful and have a high service standard. The food tasted good and fresh unlike some airlines first class. Overall its a good ad comfortable first class. Its not as good as others but it is also cheaper and definitely value for money.,1
"Panama City to Tehran via Istanbul. Tragedy. I will never travel with Turkish Airlines again. I had both the visa and the residence card of the country I wanted, but at the entrance of the flight gate, my wife and my pregnant wife were prevented from flying, and we were displaced at the Turkish airport for three days, and no one was held accountable. The flight attendants were very ignorant and stubborn. Finally, after ten days  and following up with the embassy of my country and enduring a lot of expenses, I was able to save myself and my family.",0
"Los Angeles to Salt Lake City. Seat was very comfortable, recline was acceptable. Did not use entertainment, preferred to read my book. Inflight service was excellent on this short flight. Crew was friendly, provided announcements when necessary. Check in was prompt, friendly, efficient at LAX.",1
"Jakarta to Singapore on GA824. Check in at Jakarta was fast and efficient and I was helped through the process including immigration by the Garuda ground support staff, who then took me straight to the lounge. The boarding process was well controlled and orderly. The flight left the gate on schedule, however we had to queue to take off, which delayed us by about approx. 20 minutes, however that did not delay our arrival into Singapore. After leaving immigration in Singapore my luggage was waiting for me. My overall experience was very good and I really appreciate the support provided to me in both Jakarta and Singapore by the Garuda group support teams.",1
"Alaska Airlines impressed me immensely today, specifically their flight attendants. I ended up getting food poisoning before getting onto the flight and began getting very sick on the plane. I simply asked for another bag and she brought me multiple with a stack of napkins with half of them damp. Couldn't have been more happy with the service!",1
Lake Charles to Houston via Corpus Christi. Original flight delayed over an hour. Show up an hour before the delayed time and told the plane already left. Was blamed for not showing up at the original time. Why would a system that sends an email and text saying the flight is delayed not send an alert saying the delay no longer applies? I dont know and neither did the ticket representative rather than to say it was my fault. So I here I am at the airport 4 hours later facing yet another delay with no idea of the flight is actually delayed or not.,0
"Edmonton to Vancouver. Was sceptical at first, as the ticket price was incredibly inexpensive. But Flair proved to be a great airline to fly with. The crew was very good natured and helpful. As long as you don't have a ton of luggage, it is extremely affordable to fly with them. I'd definitely use them again.",1
"Always fly first class for both personal and business, for comfort and service. The attendants were rude, non accommodating, no wine. No champagne, nothing, did not tend to passengers, constant flow of passengers from coach using first class toilet. The foul smell of toilet usage was overwhelming, bathrooms filthy. Constant flow of people with attendants not redirecting the usage. When you fly first class you expect just that, I understand the high ticket price and more than willing to pay but expect first class service. As a result, I will never fly Delta for either person so it business flights. By the way, I sent my dissatisfaction at the time, never received a response from Delta.",0
"I had a bitter experience of flying with Air Arabia two times, they keep on rescheduling and they are not providing stay or food. Moreover there is no feedback tab in their website. Reply from customer call center and reply mail is a nightmare. There is no refund for the cancellation tickets too and I received damaged baggage one time too.",0
"Munich to Amsterdam. A shorthaul flight which is not much different than a regular Lufthansa flight. Level of cabin service is about the same but certainly good enough. Flight attendants were friendly and attentive. They've an inflight wifi system which offers games, newspapers etc. All in all, a great experience.",1
"Terrible service. Traveling alone with a infant, with window seat, airline changed without knowing to a middle seat and when asked to change denied me. Will never fly again. Very rude. Paid extra money for window seat just for it to be taken away.",0
As I write this my wife is trying to get home from Bali. They promoted their new direct flight from Melbourne to Bali late last year which we booked only to be told two days before departure that they never had authorisation for that route. As a result she had to travel through KL and this added an extra 8 hours to her trip. They promised that the issue of the direct flight would be fixed before her return trip and guess what. Another text two days before she returns home saying that she is going through KL again. Then the morning of coming home the Flight to KL was cancelled and she was put on an earlier flight meaning she had to leave her hotel in a mad rush at 4am to get to the airport. In total it will now take her 16 hours to get from Bali to Melbourne with this joke of a so called airline. Add to that the customer service is poor the planes are dirty and they promise things they have no intention of delivering. Never again.,0
"We had a wonderful experience flying Allegiant. The best part was our flight attendant. He was entertaining and hilarious from the start of the flight to the very end. He greeted everyone personally as they boarded the plane, kept us all entertained during the flight, and he said goodbye to each and every person as they deboarded the plane, telling each us to have a blessed day. Keep up the good work!",1
Staff rude. Delayed plane 3 times before they cancelled. When asking there why all the delays was told it was not my concern and that they would let us know when there would be another flight. Had to sleep at airport with a handicap child. Did not offer a place to stay. Will never fly or recommend.,0
I traveled from Ft Lauderdale to Detroit and the flight was fine uncomfortable airplane but for the price what can you do. On the way back to Fort Lauderdale the flight was delayed for 3 hours? I will never flight with Spirit again even with free tickets!,0
06.40 flight 4 August Glasgow to London City cancelled with no explanation. Typical BA service nobody about to assist with alternative arrangements or any concept of customer care. So much for the worlds favourite airline. Third rate which is what I have come to expect from them.,0
"I booked a flight on Spirit Airlines in July 2017. I was able to cancel the flight and receive a voucher, which was required to be used within 60 days of cancelation. I attempted to use the voucher within the 60 day period, but I was unable to secure a flight as I was in the path of Hurricane Irma and all flights were canceled until further notice. I called Spirit Airlines to try and use the voucher once the Hurricane passed and unfortunately I was outside the 60 day period. The representative at Spirit Airlines informed me that I was outside the expiration date of the voucher and that there was no way to assist me at that time. I had hoped that since other companies, like my credit card company American Express, or car companies, like General Motors, were offering an exception due to the natural disaster, perhaps Spirit , headquartered in Fort Lauderdale where I live and where the hurricane directly hit, might have a heart. They don't. Instead they offered me a travel coupon which required I travel on flexible dates. What would be the purpose of buying a plane ticket without with having uncertainty as to the dates I'm traveling. Spirit Airlines, you need to hire a better PR team and understand that during extraordinary times, it is ok, and sometimes in your best interest as a company, to deviate from your business model to show the community you call home that you have a corporate conscience.",0
"Spirit has to be the worst airline ever. My son, girlfriend and another friend were to fly from Fort Lauderdale to Detroit. Their plane was supposed to leave at 12 and was delayed until 130. They made it to Detroit at 422 pm. The plane from Detroit to MSP was supposed to leave at 430. The pilot on the previous flight stated the plane would wait. They got to connecting flight on time only to have doors closed in their face. No offer of hotel or money back NOTHING. There are 22 other people stranded with them in Detroit until tomorrow at 430 pm. We were halfway down to MSP to pick them up.",0
"Amman to Dubai in September 2019. I was served a chicken sandwich with brown guacamole in it. I ate the sandwich and later had terrible diarrhea for 5 days which may have been caused by this, and it ruined the remaining part of my trip. Royal Jordanian made it nearly impossible to contact them or send feedback directly.",0
"The day started with an early morning flight which was delayed due to mechanical issues. They were able to get us boarded but we knew our layover in Washington was going to be tight. We were able to land 30 minutes before our connecting flight. However, there was gate delays which left us running for our connecting flight. Myself and about 5 others from the same flight reached our connecting gate and were told the gate was closed and we would have to rebook. Staff at the gate was rude and unapologetic. They refused to open the gate for us even though it was still before the scheduled take off time. We were forced to rebook with a flight which would not get us in until 10 hours later. Spent the entire day in four different airports and experienced countless delays on flights ranging from leaking bathroom sinks and spots not available at the gate. Needless to say what should have been a four hour travel time turned into a 13 hour travel day thanks to American Airlines. Spent my entire birthday on top of it in airports and stuck waiting on planes. Please save your money and book with an airline that actually cares about its customers.",0
EWR to AUA round trip business class. The flights were the flights from hell. The crew was unpleasant. The plane was very old and should have been retired long ago. The food if you want to call it that was awful to say the least. I'm easy going and I couldn't find anything positive to say. Save your money and never go UA business class.,0
Flew from London to HCM Deluxe Economy. The flight was a nightmare and not what I expected. The deluxe economy was absolutely not worth the difference. Cramped and the cabin temperature was so hot it was hard to breath. We did not receive a flight pack and there were two toothbrushes in the toilets. I asked for an eye mask and after a lot of fuss one was found but not in a hygienic bag. Cutlery for breakfast was plastic. The inflight entertainment was faulty. The flight stopped in Frankfurt and we were left without any information for two hours. I will not be flying with them again.,0
"Sydney to Honolulu flying later in April 2019. Giving great marks for Ted the agent I talked to on the phone, he was amazing and super funny, he cracked me up. Great in helping with extra baggage.",1
"Shenzhen to Sydney. I was very impressed with Southern China Airlines. Counter staff were great and organised a wonderful seat for my husband who has back pain. Ground crew organised a VIP shuttle bus to the plane. Cabin crew were very attentive and helpful, always asking if there was anything we needed. Seats were very spacious and comfortable and food was delicious. Would definitely recommend Southern China Airlines.",1
"Milano to Barcelona, the flight was late. We arrived in Barcelona with one hour and a half late and it's not the first time. It happened to us every time we took this flight from Milan to Barcelona. Due to the delay we missed the last metro and we had to go by bus under the rain! Last time I travel with Vueling for sure.",0
"New Orleans to Orlando. Flight delayed missing connection flights due to a missing flight attendant thats on another flight crazy! Staffing and communication awful! Vacation plans change due to flight. A paid guarantee tickets doesn't mean anything with this airline. Agents are rude and seem confused. Second time riding Spirit Airlines, both times flight delayed. This is a common issue, rating 0.",0
We flew from Stockholm to Oakland in August. Flight was delayed 6.5 hours. We were not notified of the delay prior to arriving at the airport. Communication concerning the delay was really poor. Once we were in the air the flight was fine. The crew were great. I understand that things happen and that flights are occasionally delayed but according to those around us most of Norwegian's flights are delayed and their communication with passengers regarding the delays is horrible. I hope that they improve their customer service but until they do I will chose another airline.,0
Exceptional service. Aircraft was 2 hours late taking off which meant we missed our connection to Dubai. China Southern staff helpful at Sydney and in Guangzhou getting us on another flight and making our time in the airport comfortable.,1
"Los Angeles to Toronto via Calgary. I asked for an earlier flight to get back to Toronto as I had a family emergency. I was told by staff that I should be able to switch to the flight next to my gate that would be leaving an hour earlier to the same destination. When I arrived I asked them at the desk. The male was somewhat co operative and considered helping me. The female was rude, told me no she will not help me and then proceeded to let 4 other passengers on the flight",0
"Flew on Garuda Indonesia on GA088 from Jakarta to Amsterdam. Garuda has their ground support team arrange a car to pick up from my home. The Check in process was fast and efficient and I was escorted through security and immigration and into the Garuda first class lounge.. Boarding was on schedule and was efficient. After takeoff I was tried and went straight to sleep in the privacy of the Garuda First Class suites. Prior to arriving in Amsterdam I was provided with a good selection of food for breakfast. I chose an omelet and the Chef onboard prepared an excellent meal. The cabin crew were every attentive and nothing was any bother for them. The Garuda Cabin crew are really outstanding together with the warming smile that makes you feel special. I would rate the overall service as excellent and would like to thank the cabin crew for their help and assistance to me and my family, they certainly made us feel at home. Upon arrival in Amsterdam I meet at the gate and taken to the Schiphol VIP and the service at the VIP lounge was excellent.",1
Orlando to Philadelphia. We lost our stroller trying to talk to baggage claim at Philadelphia airport. Nobody in the baggage claim office for hours even though office hour still operate. Call All them and they said 6 minutes which an hour ago.  Waiting over 2 hours still nobody to talk to and this is at airport.,0
"Kualanamu to Manado via Jakarta was my best flight experience. On time, service is good, and the cabin crew was so good. The transfer procedure is easy at Jakarta. I was enjoying the flight, and I will use Garuda Indonesia again and recommend to all people.",1
"Rome to New York JFK. Alitalia are the worst airline I've seen so far. Cabin crew was rude, indifferent, unavailable for long periods of time, and they made me miss a connecting flight at JFK. There was an Italian family who boarded late, and once there, attempted to move into seats in business and premium economy. The drama that ensued was long and loud and it involved every member of the crew all trying to instruct them to take their assigned seats. They argued, the crew argued and finally, finally the purser convinced them to take their seats. This burned up 40 or 45 minutes of my connection time. We finally landed at JFK and sat on the tarmac for another 45 minutes. During the flight the cabin crew would appear for short periods of time to serve meals, but then go behind their curtains to their seats for hours. Totally unacceptable. The ground crew people were also indifferent and told us that checking in online is required, and if you don't do it they give your seats away. But just try and navigate their web site. It is incomprehensible. I would avoid Alitalia.",0
"Overall, the service from dropped luggage until arrival was beyond my expectation. Dropped luggage was smooth with assistance of ground staff. The boarding was smooth, very proper announcements as zone stated in boarding pass. The cabin staff was very friendly and was service was amazing. The seat was comfortable. IFE was good. The light meal was ok as this flight are short. Wifi are good even though it is free wifi.",1
"This will be the first and last experience with this atrocious airline. Avoid at all costs. Somehow, who would have guessed an airline even worse than Spirit could pop up. I have never seen such nonexistent customer service and horrible treatment of passengers in my entire life flying several times a year on various airlines. To be completely uninformed for hours and have the flight constantly delayed, only to be canceled out of nowhere causing us to lose our entire trip. On top of that, the rude agents at the desk saying ""we cannot rebook anyone"" after abruptly canceling the flight with no issues to the aircraft. Please be wary of the low cost, it is that way for a reason.",0
"Seattle to New York. With jetblue I had a small carry on bag for free, with United your standard carry on I have to pay extra 30 bucks. Greed all over this company if you fly United just go with your street clothing. Would never fly United again.",0
"First off they force masks which isn't bad, but they don't tell you until you get to board. I almost lost my flight trying to find one in Bogota airport and had to pay 20 dollars for the one I got. The app is horrible and I paid for a window seat and didn't get it. As the app didn't save my boarding. Lastly the check in and boarding staff at the gate in Bogota airport are rude. They lost my bag on my arrival flight had to send it with Avianca and i got my clothes a day late and my bag was beaten to hell. No wifi, no video screens and no electric plugs. The cabin staff are wonderful but that can't make up for how horrible a company LATAM is.",0
I was apprehensive to fly WOW air after all the bad reviews I read. However I was pleasantly surprised flying from Newark to Reykjavik. Flights were on time and smooth. Cabin crew were very nice. The only complaint I had was the seat got uncomfortable after a while. I will bring a cushion next time or upgrade to a nicer seat. All in all a pleasant experience.,1
"Minnesota to Oslo via Keflavik. Do not use this airline. In July on a flight to and from Norway they changed our seats from more leg room to less without telling us or reimbursing us for the extra leg room we paid for. Then on the way home from Iceland we bought a set of ear buds and they charged us in Icelandic currency and when converted it came to 138.00 US for set of ear buds, the steward didn't tell us that, they had told us it would be about 7 or 8 dollars. They have refused to reimburse us for the over charge. Ear buds specially the cheap kind on airplanes don't cost 138 dollars Don't use this airline, if you do watch their tactics, they will take advantage over ones trust and naivety. Wish i could rate them a 0.",0
"Jakarta to Kuala Lumpur. My friend and I have had an appalling experience with KLM. Due to an emergency, I was not able to board the flight on that day. In response to this, an employee at the KLM counter had helped us made another reservation on next day. However, when I had arrived at the KLM counter, the KLM employees told me that there were no seats available. Therefore, I have no choice but buy another ticket with other Airline. I worried KLM will cancel my flight for returning ticket. So I contacted  KLM, and they promised me that they will have a seat for me but I need to pay some penalty. However, KLM didn't achieve what they guaranteed. When I arrived KLM counter, they told me it was fully booked. I talked to Manager, she told me that what HQ promised to you is not our business.",0
"Bogota to Pereira with Avianca. Seat 1c, no air con for over 45mins. We took off 1.15hrs late. No snacks, drinks weren't offer to me. Staff just spoke to their mates on the place. Really bad service.",0
"Newark to Boston. Being a first time flyer on jetBlue, the trip was excellent.  Amazing service from crew, very polite and welcoming. They walk you through each step from check in and to boarding. My flight only lasted around fifty minutes and the seat and entertainment system kept me happy. There are over 75 different live TV channels to choose from. As a bonus that comes with the system is a flight map and Sirus XM radio! I will definitely recommend jetBlue to anyone!",1
"We arrived on time and before we checked in, we were told the flight was cancelled to DFW ""because of the crew."" There were probably 50 other passengers for this flight and Spirit had 1 lady trying to rebook or refund each passenger. The option for the first few passengers that were helped was to stay another night, fly all the way to Chicago, then back to DFW by 10pm the next day. The only option for the rest of the 40 passengers was to get on a flight two days later! We opted for the refund because we would rather spend hundreds of extra dollars than think of ever flying Spirit Airlines again.",0
"Seoul Incheon to Chitose, and this is my first trip on board Jin Air. This is a low cost airline, no in flight entertainment on board. Nonetheless, the crew are vibrant young, friendly, attentive that keeps walking on the aisle on the aircraft to ensure passengers are well taken care. This is definitely the best low cost airline I ever flown. I shall definitely look forward to travel Jinair again.",1
First time flying with them and was impressed. The seats were comfortable with lots of leg room. The touch screen was great with about 50 movies to pick from including lots that are only just out at the cinema in the UK. Food was really good but would have liked more. Service was brilliant the cabin crew smiled the whole time.,1
Bali to Ho Chi Minh City. Pay the extra money to fly with another company. The extra time and expenses means you're paying less with other companies. The tickets don't include luggage and you're overcharged at the counter. Avoid this airline and save money elsewhere. The wait to check in was an hour long so get there at least 3hrs early.,0
"The flight was delayed by 6 hours, allegedly because of a radar system failure at Rome Fiumicino airport. Strangely, only the Germanwings flight to Berlin was affected, Air Berlin left on time. Delays can happen, but the complete lack of information and assistance was not acceptable. No ground staff was available, phone calls to Germanwings were not answered. No meal voucher was offered. To add insult to injury, access to Star Alliance lounges is denied to Gold members outside Germany when you travel with Germanwings because they are a Lufthansa subsidiary but not a member of Star Alliance. The flight itself was smooth, but no inflight entertainment whatsoever. For the same price, Air Berlin offers much better value. Will not travel Germanwings again.",0
Had to pay twice for baggage because their system didn't recognise I'd paid prior to arrival. This error didn't show up until I got to the boarding gate. Was promised a refund if I contacted customer services. 6 months later I get an email saying its company policy not to refund baggage charges and now its too late for my bank to do a charge back. Avoid at all costs.,0
Flight JL 074 15th July 2013. KL to Tokyo and it was probably the best journey that I've had. Cabin is very well maintained good food cabin crew very polite and the food is exceptionally good too. I am tall and I had good leg room space and overall I was very happy in choosing Japan Airlines.,1
"Perth to Phuket via Kuala Lumpur. Was due to fly in April but was cancelled by airline in March. No refund has been given, being told it was non refundable ticket, yet nothing states this.",0
Winnipeg to Hamilton. I have never had such an unreliable service. My flight out was delayed 9 hrs. Suppose to be at 630pm was at 4am. My return flight was completely canceled and I had to fly home New Years Eve. I don't think I will ever fly Swoop again.,0
China Eastern Airlines from Delhi to Los Angeles and back for the first time. Had asked for wheelchair assistance got it on all legs of the journey except Los Angeles to Shanghai. Got a wheelchair on arrival in Shanghai took me to the transfer desk to validate onward journey to Delhi and then said walk past security check. Very poor quality food same meal served for Lunch and dinner.,0
"Phuket to Bangkok. They do not have transparent luggage policy. While booking you will not see any kind of luggage limit or so on, but while travelling they won't allow you with extra luggage. My travel cost was around 2300 THB for two person, and for extra luggage I have to pay around 7000 THB. Very cheap service, they are not contactable anyhow, nor they will reply to your feedback or emails. Even the water is chargeable during flight.  I personally suggest do not travel with this airline.",0
"Our flight has been changed for the fourth or fifth time in less than a week. One cancellation resulted in a three day delay in which they told us this is our problem as the notice was more than 24 hours. They have more than enough staff to support the clientele but all were sitting on their phones doing everything in their power to ignore us. We were ignored at every turn and offered nothing. The flight itself and the cabin crew were fine, provided you can leave when advertised, but this is never the case it seems. I feel sorry for the cabin crew as they deal with upset customers all the time because of the lack of organisation, customer service and care from the ground staff. I cannot begin to describe how strongly I would avoid this airline. We decided on a different provider for their domestic travels. Every worker from other companies seemed to roll their eyes at the mentioning of our situation and present the idea that this should be expected.",0
April 8 2015 flight 323 and April 13 2015 flight 424. When we booked with Spirit I was terrified for our flight due to all these awful reviews. After flying with them I feel like a lot of people only write reviews when they get bad service. I know a lot of people actually have had bad experiences but ours was fine. Yes you do have to pay for everything but they do tell you that on the website. I flew to LAX from MSP with my husband and two little girls. Flights were all on time. Everyone was nice. No problems at all. If you're thinking of flying Spirit don't let all these bad reviews deter you.,1
"On a direct flight cannot get the bags for the customers on the flight given 2 hours to get it through TSA security. Then, upon getting the bag delivered 12 hours later, takes 6 days and counting, to get a bag delivered to the customer who lives 2 hours away from the destination.",0
"Me and my family have been flying with Jetblue Airways every year for the past 15. Sometimes situations are beyond their control. Late staff, weather, lack of disclosure due to uncertainty, etc. Experienced it all. However, what really bothers me I forgot something on the plane on the flight from San Francisco to Boston, realized it as I exited the plane. Have told the staff right away, made a formal claim at the airport within half hour. I haven't retrieved the item yet. 3 weeks later. You leave anything behind and it's gone, no way another passenger would have found it in the deep pocket. They couldn't care less. Employees go first I guess. No work ethic whatsoever. Deeply disappointed.",1
"Budapest to Tel Aviv in December 2019. 6.5 hours without water, food. There was 6 hours delay, 4 hours on the plane and the staff didn't give us water or food, not even to go to the toilet. 2 hours from the six hours in a small place with a small toilet, no food, no drinks only security. After take off they brought us water and sandwich. When i asked them to explain why, they said nothing happened it is not my business.",0
"I came back to US from Panama on flight 2192 on July 21st. The flight was delayed as usual. The flight attendants, except Keko, were not friendly at all. They were sitting on the last row, just behind me, playing with their phones while Keko was working all the time preparing the ""food and beverages"" for the passengers. While she was doing her job,  one of the flight attendants told her to stop working because she was doing too much! He did not even care that we, the reason for what he has a job were listening to him because we are not important anymore for the American employees. It's unbelievable how disrespectful they were, pretending nobody could understand them. I always try to avoid American because of these attitudes that are present in almost every employee. It's very disappointing to see the ""American"" Airline to treat their passengers, the people they are supposed to serve, like we are trash.",0
"Mumbai to Kolkata. Worst airline service in India. Cancelled flight and informed just 2 days before and didn't provide me any solution. I told them that I have very important purpose and have a train to catch on, still they had no solution. No customer support at all. They leave you on your own.  Worst experience will recommend not to chose this airline service",0
Flew Izmir to Munich. Great flight. On time and free 30kg of luggage. Reserved our seats and food and beverages included in price. Plane was spotless and modern. Staff were excellent and very attentive. I recommend this carrier.,1
Please spend your money on another airline. They do not care or value your time. I can handle a flight being delayed a few hours but to wait for over an hour at baggage claim is ridiculous. They literally changed my flight the night before departure from a 2 hour flight to an 11 hour flight. 11 hours from Missouri to Florida. Are you kidding me.,0
"Luton to Alicante 9th September. Due to technical problems with Monarch Airlines plane we boarded a replacement A320 operated for Monarch by Titan Airways. A flight just like they used to be. A professional and articulate purser, and other crew members very good too. Most refreshing was that all passengers received a free hot breakfast and beverages, served swiftly. The most enjoyable to Alicante I have taken, courtesy of Titan Airways. ",1
"Flew Spirit Airlines from Dominican Republic to Chicago O'Hare. This is the worst airline with the worst customer service. First our flight is cancelled due to bad weather then other airlines took off for that same destination. Then we went to get the next earliest flight and they say it is in 2 days! So now we have lost hundreds of dollars to drive to another airport and buy tickets. Never again, do not waste you time on their 'cheap flights'.",0
Had a flight from Gatwick to Zakynthos with Grand Cru Airlines as Small Planet had an issue with one of there aircraft. The staff were stunning and so friendly. The aircraft was one of the best with very good comfy seating. Thank you for getting our holiday off to a good start. Would fly with Grand Cru Airlines any time.,1
"London to Houston. The seats were so tightly together one could not take off a sweater, tie a shoe, pick up a bag from under a seat in front of the place of sitting. I am a regular female US size 12. I could feel the legs and hips on either side of me of the people who were sitting beside me who also not overweight. One cannot moves legs or shift at all. It is a physical danger of sitting in limited confined spaces for hours on end with no ability to move in any way. I recommend not using this airline.  It is better for an airline to charge a bit more and treat the customers physical being safely than put their health at risks. I was astonished to see the seating set up as it was. I simply do not know how men could sit in the seats when I was having such a hard time in doing so.",0
"We were not supposed to be on this flight but had been bumped from our Icelandair flight and rebooked onto BA direct from Toronto to London Heathrow. We tried to get it changed as we were supposed to fly into Gatwick. The flight was quite good. Service was fantastic, and the chicken tikka masala was tasty. The crew onboard was friendly, flight was on time, and landing was amazingly smooth.",1
"Athens to Santorini. Very poor value! They charged us 70 euros for one extra bag which weighed under 10 kilos. Poor staff, rude, useless. Take any other airline if you can.",0
"Cologne Bonn to Copenhagen . When we got to the airport to get our boarding pass, was told that we have to pay 55 euros per person to check in which can usually be done on a kiosk in 2 minutes. Our family paid 165 euros in the end. Our wonderful Europe vacation ended right there. This is the first time I experienced this kind of business practice. Then later I found in the fine print section on the ticket saying airport check in fee is 50 euros. Very disappointed and will never fly Ryanair again.",0
"Terrible experience. Hard to locate and totally uninterested and inattentive flight crew, cold dry meals, filthy bathroom. Connection delayed 4 times, then cancelled. Waited in line for 3.5 hours to reschedule and was told only available flight was in 2 days. No hotel or meal reimbursement. Luggage was sent ahead and we wore the same clothes for 2 days. Never again on Delta!",0
"As a platinum member of this Airline, I do not appreciate my personal details given out to people over the phone then emailed to other email adresses not on my file. This is a major breach. I am sharing this so you are aware that your privacy is at risk with this airline and good luck getting any reason, its been a month and all I get told is that they are looking into it but wont give me a name of someone I could follow up with. After 8 phone calls different departments, 5 emails and even posting on FB still they all say we are looking into it. Which I doubt they are. Deal with them at your own risk.",0
"I was very disappointed with Allegiant Air's professionalism and customer service. After being delayed 7 hours due to weather they canceled our flight due to a flight crew duty time limitation. Our flight was rescheduled for the next afternoon, but we missed a day of our bachelorette party in Las Vegas. Allegiant customer service were rude and uncooperative on the phone. They offered no vouchers or help for our lost time. I understand that the initial delay was due to weather, and nothing can be done about that. However the cancellation was due to flight crew hours and should have been monitored more closely.",0
"Singapore to Adelaide via Denpasar. I was very disappointed with total lack of service on these flights. There was no complimentary food or drink, no pillow or blanket, no entertainment, no WiFi and no leg room. We have travelled on many ""budget"" airlines and they offer a full service. These Jetstar flights were not that cheap in comparison. Adding to this they were the only flights from our trip which included 1p flights that were delayed.",0
"Manila to Singapore return. As a disabled passenger who requires wheelchair assistance to the cabin door, I was shocked at the lack of care or courtesy from the JetStar ground crew. The airport staff in Manila took very good care of me through ticketing and to the gate but then I was left to the uncaring JetStar staff at the gate and in the air. Singapore was even worse as the airport staff leaves me in the uncaring hands to JetStar at the ticket counter, who told me they could not provide any assistance to the gate until 45 minutes before boarding. After paying a young airport staff member a few dollars he got me out to the gate. The cabin staff from Singapore was even worse than the ground crew as they spent most of the flight hidden behind the curtain laughing. I was shocked at the unprofessionalism and uncaring of the entire JetStar team.",0
"Washington to London Heathrow. Have flown with Virgin for several years now and finding them to be better each time. My last 3 flights July 2017, September 2017 and most recently 9 December 2017. I am a disabled veteran and have issues sitting for long periods, and therefore enquired as to whether I could have 2 seats, and on all 3 flights they accommodated me. This last flight I made mention to one of the cabin crew that my Mum loved the Cake Love Red Velvet cake and I could not believe how generous and caring they were. I have found the staff to be friendly, helpful, polite and accommodating.",1
"Unfortunately we experienced very poor customer service on this flight. The boarding staff were flustered and short tempered with all passengers due to some confusion and then forced about 20 of us to sky check our luggage without explanation, which was extremely inconvenient as we were then taking a connecting flight with another airline and this added significant delay to our travel time. Upon boarding there were several open overhead baggage bins many of which remained completely empty for the flight making our forced baggage check completely unnecessary. Needless to say, I would avoid taking this airline again if not necessary.",0
"Kuching to Penang. This is what I love about budget airline. Even though you just pay a little amount of money, sometimes you will be getting a lot more. I even get aircraft miniature in my flight. Plus, all the staff are good looking and very neat.",1
"Perth to Melbourne. Despite cancelling my flight they refuse to provide me with a refund and have credited a different airline without my consent. This is theft. Doesn't help that when I call to ask why I got a smartass telling me that it was ""obvious"" why this was done, no it isn't obvious, it's theft.",0
Flight from Amsterdam via Abu Dhabi to Jakarta. Service was great food quality good. Media system wasn't amazing but there was one in every seat which isn't available on all airlines. Overall very pleased.,1
"Rome to Pisa. My first experience with this company was really bad. First, the flight is delayed for one hour and the second I haven't received my baggage and still waiting to be found.",0
I flown two flights with LOT first from DUS to WAW on August 16th and second from WAW to LWO on August 21st. Both flights operated by their Embraer fleet were on time clean cabin comfortable seat attentive crew. I do recommend them.,1
"Delays are normal for this airline, so you would think that they know how to handle such delays, but they don't. 9 out of 11 of their flights were delayed at Mexico city. Only one person was handling a crowd of anxious people looking for information about their flights. Horrible experience. I also had to spend the whole night trying to sleep on the floor because of a delay in Monterrey.",0
We flew with American Airlines from Hartford to Orange County via Dallas. My wife and I had to use the customer services of wheelchair. We found the staff helpful and accommodating. We felt we were taken care off. Staff of AA were courteous on our journey. Will fly AA again.,1
"As a first time traveller with Qatar Airways I must say that I cannot fault any part of the service received on this trip. I also travelled the route in the opposite direction a few weeks earlier. Staff most attentive and food outstanding. It was exciting to experience the A380, but my preference would be the Boeing 777 business cabin, being much more more intimate and personal than the much larger A380. I also believe the seat is better on the Boeing 777. ",1
"I have always been a frequent traveler with Qatar Airways whenever possible. But this summer me and my wife decided to travel to Istanbul for a week long holiday and decided to try out Turkish Airlines. What a bad choice it was. Right from the start of the journey, all the flights were late. From CPH to IST, it was delayed by 3 hours and no explanations were provided. However it brought us to Istanbul in one piece and along with the luggage, so that was a bit or relief. The seat was good but the food was barely ok, as I don't think they were particularly fresh. But it was on our return trip they broke all the expectations. To begin with, the flight was delayed again by 3 hours. The ground staff were very rude and barely spoke English. We had some fragile items, which were properly packed, tagged and labeled. In addition to that, we had put on the Turkish Airlines fragile stickers as required by the ground staff. But it never arrived with us to CPH. After investigating, it was told to us that it was not loaded and will arrive next day. But when it arrived, it was not in one piece. One third of the things were broken and there were clear sing of mishandling and wear and tears as the package was scraped. We took pictures of the broken materials and the ripped package instantly in front of the delivery person and sent it to Turkish Airlines. But alas, it was of no use. They ignored our complaint. Not even replying to our email initially. We tried to call to the HQ in Istanbul and then they said they will look into it and later replied that they dont have any responsibility towards it, as it is fragile item so the owner bears the risk of any damage and not the Airlines. I have flown with many other Airlines in my quest of travelling over 50 countries but never have faced such poor customer service. I will never fly with them again. ",0
"Beirut to Sofia. This is the worst airline. My journey was delayed by 14 hours and I have been trying to reach out to the complaint team in vain. Their lines are always busy and they haven't replied to my mail after more than 2 months following this message. ""Your documents will be processed within the statutory period of two months"". Does anyone know how they can be reached?",0
"Smithers to Penticton via Vancouver. Worst experience ever. My return flight was a couple hours late which made me miss my connection in Vancouver, I was told by the ticket agents before I flew to Vancouver that once I get to Vancouver at Midnight that Air Canada would provide me with a hotel and meal voucher. Once I got to Vancouver I went to Air Canada Customer Service and was told by their less than caring agent that they will not provide me with a hotel and that I could find a pillow and blanket at baggage claim. Got down to baggage and asked for a pillow and blanket and they were once again rude and said they don't provide that.",0
"I would like to thank the Manila ticketing staff because she gave me the email address where i can tell my problem. After my email to them. They respond so quickly and they give me hope that they will try to find. Everyday, they gave me updates. until the day that they email me that my passengers have confirm slots.  Thank you for the assistance that you rendered to me.",1
"Sydney to Gold Coast. My flight has been cancelled at last moment due to weather, it is understandable. But after waiting at airport counter, they were not able to give another flight for next 4 days. And offered Qantas voucher with life time validity. Then after a week, I received a Jetstar voucher with only 6 month validity. I am not a regular domestic traveler , so it is same as no refund.",0
Toronto to Victoria on July 10 2013. Only TV on the plane that didn't work was mine! Attendant came and tapped it a few times and nothing but showed no real concern its only a 5 hour flight!! We were row 5 I had specifically picked those seats and paid extra for them but at the time they were not deemed 'undesirable' unfortunately now they were and when the row in front reclined we lost use of our trays and the only 1 TV that was working which we were sharing! It was a bad situation and a horrible flight. When the food and beverage services started I passed the attendant my visa and asked to run a tab the other attendant said it wouldn't be any charge for my cheese platter due to the problems we were having with that the attendant said 'now are you happy'. I fly regularly on Westjet and have noticed a change from before certainly not going to be my go to airline anymore getting the poor service is one thing upsetting my daughter due to complete ignorance is another.,0
"Disgusting service with Emirates. I am a rewards member and my flights were terrible. Being bumped from our reserved seats on both our return trips, even though my seats were confirmed. I complained on my first two flights and they assured me that my return flights were safe. Well they weren't. They bumped us again. I am disgusted at the Emirates attitude. I won't fly with them again. Choose a different carrier you will save yourself some grief.",0
"Paris to Oklahoma City via Dallas DFW with American Airlines. Like other reviews I've read, they have failed to explain that our flight is delayed till far after the departure time which is frustrating. This is my last flight home and it is delayed about 3 hours. My whole trip I've experienced a snappy crew making rude comments to myself and other customers. Very disappointed.",0
"The customer service is awful. I booked my flight online, received my confirmation email which stated the flight was cancelled. The flight was rebooked with a confirmation of departure. However I was still charged for the cancelled flight. When speaking with customer service I was told I had cancelled the flight so no refund would be issued. This was not the case at all. I would not suggest this airline. There is no Spirit in their customer service.",0
"On boarding my Thai Airways flight from Oslo to Bangkok, I was greeted with a warm welcome by cabin staff. Escorted to my seat, given a hot towel and offered Champagne, newspapers and magazines.  The dinner menu was great, four main dishes to choose from and several wines, white and red. With the cheese we were offered port. The seat can be adjusted to a flat bed, with enough space to turn, which for me essential for a good sleep. I have been using Thai Airways more or less every year since 1979 and have experienced the ups and downs. I will say they are back on track now. They the best nonstop flight from Norway to Thailand.",1
Just returned from Barcelona on Air Canada's Rouge flight. I will not be doing this again. Terrible seating inexperienced flight attendants no entertainment units not even headphone connectors made a very boring and uncomfortable flight. Consider this a bargain basement airline.,0
We were jammed in like cattle on flights from Montreal to Orlando return on Air Canada Rouge. Legroom was substandard. You pay substantially less to fly on Sunwing and Ryanair for this type of service so why is Air Canada allowed to sell regular priced tickets for Sunwing and Ryanair type service.,0
"Flew home last night flight from Las Vegas to New York JFK, flight 1248. Wanted to give credit where credit is due! This was the first flight I have flown where the captain came over the PA and made an announcement assuring us about the turbulence, how uncomfortable it can be for us but to be reassured the aircraft can handle these type of situations and not to worry. I felt he did everything he can possibly do to try and avoid the constant turbulence to make for a peaceful flight. Will make sure to make JetBlue as my first flight choice in the future.",1
"Amsterdam to Izmir. Great flight with free 30kg hold luggage, seat selection and food and drink included in the very affordable flight. I highly recommend this airline. Flight was on time and very attentive staff. I wish they would fly from Ireland all year round.",1
"Ft Myers to Charlotte. Very disappointed with the service I received. I will never fly this airline again and will tell others to avoid this airline.  After upgrading my seats online to ensure my travel companion and I were seated together, only the second half of the connecting flight was assigned but I was still charged a full amount for preferred seating options on both flights. After waiting half an hour on the phone I was told to come in early to address it at check in. After coming to the airport 4 hours early, we were told it would have to be addressed at the gate. An attendant didn't arrive until 1.5 hours before the flight. When I kindly asked for assistance, he informed me the flight was completely full and said ""Oh well, you have a window seat, use that as a bargaining chip.""",0
"Dublin to Istanbul with Turkish Airlines. Flight was on time, boarding quick and cabin staff extremely helpful. The seat was more than comfortable and spacious for the duration of the flight. Drinks were plentiful and I especially enjoyed the lemon drink served. A light snack served was enjoyable and tasty. All through the flight the staff were very attentive. This was a great way to begin what was a long day, I had a connecting flight to the Philippines from Istanbul.",1
"St Thomas to Ft Lauderdale. They lost my bag which was right near my husbands bag. They also tagged my husbands bag with my name, and tagged my bag with his name. Very careless and unorganized.",0
Brisbane to Adelaide. Do not bother flying with this airline. I decided to fly with this flight as it was cheap and was one of the earliest flights. I am still waiting to board after being delayed over 3 hours already which means I could've chosen a later flight and still arrived earlier then I am going to.,0
"I book a flight from Memphis to Orlando, it was a quick weekend trip to go to a wedding, I booked it two months in advance. I thought I would try this small airline because it was a straight flight. The flight was to leave Memphis at 5.25 pm. At 9.30 am I went online and got my boarding pass, but at 9.45 they canceled the flight. I called the airline and was asked what language? So I said English, but the guy had such bad broken English, that I had to ask him to repeat himself 2 to 3 times for everything he said. They wanted to book me for 4 days later which was 2 days after the wedding, I asked to be booked on another airline, but after trying about 6 times to understand him, I asked him to just give me back my money, he refunded my ticket, while he was doing it I asked why the flight was canceled. For the first time he spoke clearly and said do to weather. Although 3 hrs before the flight and past the time the flight would leave, it was 75 degrees and sunny in Memphis and it was 80 and sunny in Orlando, and clear all the way in between! I will never ever book another flight with Spirit again.",0
"London  to Colombo via Kuwait. Awful airline, completely inept to provide a service. We missed connecting flights to and from our destination, due to delayed planes on the first flights, even though all were provided by the Kuwait Airways. On the return journey we arrived with the aircraft in view, and were told the gate was closed, despite the screen still saying proceed to gate, and being told the flight would be held for us. The plane was there for 30 minutes while we protested, and one gentleman's passport was taken from his person by a security guard when he tried to take a photo of the plane. Following this, there was no communication provided, we were left to gather our own information from the transit desk, where there was over 1000 people we were told. The result was a delay of over 30 hours on the flight out to Colombo, and 20 hours on the way back, and 3 unwanted nights in Kuwait airport's hotel. At no point were we offered an apology. Total incompetence from all involved, each individual shrugged off the blame elsewhere. Do not use.",0
"It was the worst experience of my life. The counter staff at the airport was very unprofessional and rude, with no idea how to deal with customers. They must have to provide very good customer service training before making them sit on counters. First impression is the last. I would not recommend anyone to fly with Etihad.",0
"Booked with Jetstar 3 days before my flight. Received no email with confirmations or anything, no itinerary no nothing. Checked again later and still nothing. On the day I had to buy new flights with Air NZ because I couldn't confirm I had a booking with Jetstar. Called for a refund and spoke to a potato of a human that had no idea he was at work, no refund, no English, no service.",0
You will never get anywhere on time. This is my 4th flight in two weeks and none of them left on time. This is the third flight where we waited on the gate to open up and we have been waiting for an hour now.,0
I just returned from a trip from Seattle WA to Punta Cana DR and back. I told my husband after the first plane that I would never fly American again. It was 3 planes there and 3 back. The seats were the most tiny and uncomfortable seats I have ever sat in. I am 5 ft 2 and 115 lbs so by no means am I a big person. The staff were awful. I have never met people so disinterested and rude. When leaving Punta Cana we sat in line for 1.5 hours because there was no one there to check us in! Every other airline were getting people through. We made it to our flight in the nick of time. We got there at 4am and didn't get to the plane until 6.25 and it left at 6.50. They were almost done boarding. I do not recommend this airline.,0
"Manila to Kuwait. Seats are ok flat bed seats. however you should not expect anything else. Seems this airline you pay for seat nothing more. Bad on board service even more terrible ground services. Flight scheduled at 10am they rescheduled it twice, below average business lounge. went to hotel airport terrible, could not stay there went back.",0
"Flew Lublin to Heraklion. Very comfortale trip, without delays, friendly, helpful and professional crew, good amtosphere on board, everything fast and without problems. I felt safe during the journey and I think that I will choose Small Planet for my next year holiday.",1
Worst experience of life. We were told from front desk that our carry on baggage was good to go got up to our gate and was told put your baggage in the sizer and we did as so and fit perfectly. A rude manager said need to be flush and told us we would have to pay another 100 dollar fee before entering the plane. We will never use this airline and further for our destination.,0
"Very bad customer service, flight always change. I also have a next flight on the next 2 days but the airline cancel my trip that I had already paid for hotel and car rental. The worst airline that I ever used!",0
Worst airline experience of my life. Have flown over 300 times in last 10 years. Canceled flight for maintenance and stranded my family in a random city overnight with no safe transportation to a hotel. Refused to reimburse us for anything. When trying to call to get any compensation for money spent to keep family safe and get them home the airline continued to hang up calls and refuse help.,0
"Madrid to Dublin. The bag policy is just a joke. If you don't buy priority, you wont be allowed a bag in cabin. It's not even a cheap company any more, next time i will fly with Aer Lingus or equivalent.",0
Geneva to Krakow. Easyjet goes from bad to worse. I remember times she it was most reliable and very correct company. This year it's a disaster. Every flight is delayed for various excuses. I'm a frequent flyer I board once per week. Flying on time is a big exception. It's normal for them to board on time and keep waiting on a craft for an hour or keep at the gate with no info. Half an hour delay become a standard and noone cares about passengers connections. Besides stuff is less and less qualified and motivated. Sometimes they hardly speak English and make no effort to make themself understood. I'm really disappointed with the company performance. With a Hub in Geneva it unfortunately lost all Swiss or EU standards. Now I'm at the airport and see that will get info only at the scheduled time of departure. So two hours waiting with no information.,0
"Zurich to Ankara. Worst airline ever. They decided to close the gate a little too early, leaving 9 passengers behind at the airport, although the passengers were at the gate E62 10 minutes before departure time. Zurich airport E gates needs extra 15 minutes.",0
"Dreadful service from miserable staff. All the decent host staff have cleared out over Covid, leaving only cranky and jaded people who should really find another way to make a living. It is particularly disappointing given the delightful experiences I have had with this airline in the past.",0
"Paris to Chisinau. I have maybe flown 10 times with Air Moldova. I was surprised by the quality of service provided by such a small operator, and my trips with them have always been very pleasant. Lately, to avoid taxes, they decided to switch from Paris Charles De Gaulle to Paris Beauvais airport. At first, I was a bit disappointed, because it seems to me less easy to fly from Beauvais, but after few tries, I got to understand that there is no huge difference reaching Beauvais or Charles de Gaulle airports when you live far from Paris. I highly recommend Air Moldova.",1
"We just flew from Milan to Brisbane Australia and back, and we would like to thank the company and all the crew of our flights for the excellent service provided. It was the first time for us with Qatar Airways, and we were delighted by the comfort of the plane and the care given by the crew, which is not ordinary compared to the other major airlines I flown with before. We will be more than happy to travel again with them in the next future.",1
"Dallas to Frankfurt via Keflavik. Worst customer service ever. Cancelled flight to Dallas and dumped me in Ohio in the middle of the night. Not met by anyone from WOW till 3 a.m. No help in getting home. Finally bought a ticket on my own to Dallas. After two weeks, the bags eventually showed up, and only after I called wrote and email a dozen times. Applying for compensation is a nightmare. The ""simple"" forms which WOW requires one to file out are not simple. The whole enterprise is a Catch 22. You need a booking number, I am told. There is none. WOW sends an email saying the booking number is on the email. It is not. I cannot tell if these actions are intentionally or negligently plain stupid. WOW's customer service if offensive. The money saved by booking WOW was and is not worth the effort.",0
"I had an amazing time traveling with Avelo, this was one of my first flight from Fort Myers to New Haven. The check in staff are extremely efficient, they check in every customer with a smile on their face. You can really tell they care about you and your travel experience. Sometimes customers are rude to them but they always handle it so professionally. The check in line was very long but but the staff made it move very quickly. I was at my gate in no time, the plane was running a bit behind schedule but nothing to complain about. The aircraft was clean and they even had music playing when we boarded! The crew was very nice and did their best to make everyone happy. Arrived to New Haven not too late and very happy to say my bags arrived too! New favorite airline!",1
Flew return from Oslo to Fort Lauderdale in Premium Cabin in October 2014. Both flights departed spot on time. Comfort onboard was very good considering a ticket price much less than a normal business class. Seats and service is more basic than many business class but in many ways more relaxing without the normal fuss there. The quietness and air quality on the brand new 787 made the trip remarkable less tiresome than normal.,1
"Minsk to Astana. Awful experience. Flight attendants gave me the impression I was being discriminated for not speaking Russian. The other passengers were allowed to move freely while they kept telling me to go to my seat because of ""turbulence"". When I confronted them eventually they stopped it. Poor food and beverage quality. Old airplane. But the worst thing was the service. They didn't even give me an immigration card.",0
"Auckland to Chengdu. Their cabin was fresh and clean and being a newer aircraft, was kept very well. The service is warm and professional.  The seats fold flat and my kids slept for most of the 13 hour flight. We arrived relaxed and stress free considering that we had 2 young kids to look after and worry about. Night flights with kids are the way to go. The food was very tasty. The flight attendants were very polite and accommodating. They never made you feel you were a burden to them. I will happily fly Sichuan in the future.",1
It's definitely last time I am flying with Spirit Airline. Delays again for my flight from Detroit to New Orleans. My last 2 flights with them few years ago were the same. I said I'll give them another chance. It's my birthday and I'm trapped in the airport for a connection flight to my destination. Need better management and learn how to manage time. I would never recommend this airline.,0
"I am a travel agent so I fly often this was my first time flying with Jetblue and the absolute last time. I planned a couples trip to Jamaica for my 40th. We was supposed to have a connecting flight through Florida but they changed for us to go through NY which didn't make any sense.The flight going to Jamaica was fine and on time but the flight coming home was a nightmare from hell! First we had a hour delay coming out of Jamaica then when we connected in NY again it just got worst and worst. We had a delay again but for hours then there was a slight rainstorm but then it stop and for some reason jetblue canceled all the flights. They didn't offer any voucher for hotel or anything. We had to search hours and hours to get a hotel because they were all sold out they rescheduled our flight for the next day all the way at night like 8pm which was crazy. Then when we got back to the airport they changed our gate twice, there was another delay for another two hours because they were waiting for another plane to leave. When we finally got on the plane the captain says we have to wait for someone to put the bags on and to pull plane out, we are short staffed so that was another hour at this point I was so frustrated cause I just want to go home, its going on midnight now when we were supposed to leave at 8pm.",0
"Cancun to London. The date is March 16th. I am with my family in Cancun and just heard the Prime Minister's address asking all Canadian's to come home due to covid19. I wanted to change my Swoop flights from Saturday to an earlier flight on Thursday and Swoop would not do the change. I had to buy new tickets and take travel vouchers in order to get home. Additionally, while I was booking the flights they jacked up the price! Unbelievable!",0
"Last month I booked my flight directly through the TK company website. On my way back at the airport, I was told that my connection flight from Istanbul to USA is canceled and I have to wait at Istanbul Airport till the next day to catch the next flight to USA. This resulted in a very inconvenient situation where I had to wait for 14 hours overnight sitting on a chair at the airport, which was shut down, and I missed important business on the day I was supposed to be back home. This is exactly what I tried to avoid when booking my flight although there were other respected airlines offering cheaper prices. They did not even bother to send me an email or contact me before departure to let me know that the connection flight is canceled, although I entered my contact information when booking the ticket. I wrote to TK customer service complaining about this situation no one cared to reply. Do yourself a favor and avoid flying with Turkish Airlines or you may experience this yourself.",0
"The check in lines were long and there were not enough staff. The flight delayed for over an hour, more than 5 baggage were lost in a flight which causing a long queue on the luggage center. However, there were only two staff there. The staff promised to deliver the missing baggage to my address within a week. Turn out it is still missing while I am writing this comment, which is almost a month since my flight. I tried different methods to contact Air France and it is really hard to call them. There is a email that you will never get a response. There exists a phone number but you had to wait for at least 35 minutes before they pick up your call. I Called a lot in these three weeks ,wasting a lot of times but no one really could help. I went to the airport, imagining someone can help if I meet them, but the baggage service center was closed and all other staffs told me they can do nothing. So basically if you take Air France and the baggage is lost during the flight, you will not be able to do anything and no one from Air France can help you.",0
"Gatwick to Toulouse. Bussed out to remote stand because aircraft had previously been under maintenance. Priority passengers first off bus and into cabin. Full flight but cabin staff managed to deal with all cabin luggage although a few priority passengers grumbled because they could not stow their luggage immediately over their seats. Flight smooth and cabin crew very engaging. Flight departed a few minutes late but arrived right on time. No queue at Border Control so very quick completion of arrival formalities. While writing this, I have to say that I have travelled with easyJet many times and have never encountered any of the problems that other contributors allude to. However, I always travel Priority which makes life easy. Cabin crews have always been obliging but I do ensure that I know the baggage rules and never get caught out.",1
"Flew Madrid to Tenerife North with Norwegian. Given wrong times of our delayed flight via text message and from the desk. Plane already arrived than expected. No assistance given for a disabled person. Complained to customer services soon after. Last week, sent three emails, heard nothing. If you are thinking of sending emails to them, you are wasting your time.",0
"American Airlines is my number one for great customer support and amazing membership awards. I fly to States almost every other month, and I choose American Airlines every time. I honestly sometimes choose them among cheaper options for the same trip. I know when I need help with my booking, they are so easy to reach and come up with a solution. They are very flexible with bookings especially in these difficult lockdown days.",1
Denver to Los Angeles. Have been sitting in the Denver airport for 6 hours because United had a faulty hydraulics and then the fuel system was leaking. No customer service reps with help or explain anything. We are left here waiting. I have to be in a wedding g party tomorrows. We are paying for a car rental and a hotel as well because they dont know how to service their planes or have a back up. Disgusting,0
"Tel Aviv to Toronto. Fantastic timing, being a night flight and arriving early morning. Excellent king David lounge in Tel Aviv. Lounge in Toronto is shared with KLM, which is a little lousy. Inflight service was very friendly. in a couple of months the Boeing 787  will be in service for this route.",1
"A boutique airline, managed under Malaysia airlines. Mainly fly within Western Malaysia peninsula, with only one international destination which is Singapore. I appreciate the fact that they use the old Subang airport, and it flies to another little airport and that's Xeletar in Singapore. Check in was done quickly. Boarding process was orderly and smooth. The ATR32 is a small but beautiful plan laid out in a 2x2. The seats are actually quite spacious and good leg room, stewardess are welcoming and hard working, free water and packet of nuts given free. Overall it was a unique experience. This is definitely another great way to travel between these 2 cities. Get a window seat for a great scenic flight experience.",1
Nadi to LAX today and was pleasantly surprised. Flight was on time an upgrade was offered to upper deck and my wife and I had 3 seats each which allowed plenty of room and comfort. The dreaded food box arrived and to be honest for the time of night was perfectly adequate sandwich wrap crisps coleslaw and a drink. Breakfast was ok as well entertainment was adequate as well for a night flight. Staff were very good and flight arrived half hour early despite LAX's best efforts to delay us. I would have no problem using them again.,1
After travelling Air Asia on a rugby trip from Christchurch through to KUL and then on to Clarke. I have nothing but great things to say about this so called budget airline. Food was great and staff were fantastic. Seats were great and all ground staff were happy to help. Its a shame that Air Asia have to pull out of Christchurch.,1
"Zurich to Brussels with Brussels Airlines. If everything goes well, you have a nice trip, but as soon as something happens, customer service is really bad. They don't understand very common situations, move you around from one place to another, mail, phone. I had a 1 day trip, fly in the morning, come back in the evening, it had to be 2 different bookings because of these time constraints it seems. My morning flight was cancelled due to the weather. So I had to cancel my meeting and the evening flight back as well. I had paid the proposed cancellation insurance, so no problem right? Right, after communicating everything to customer service you are pointed to the website, then to email, then to insurance company, then back to email, then to another website form, then back to email. Nobody understands this very simple situation, each person knows only his very own confined set of rules and claims he can't help you. This is just really bad customer service. I thought major airlines were past these issues, but apparently, Brussels Airlines still hasn't figured this out.",0
"Bangkok to Frankfurt, delayed by 3 hours, no proactive communication. Just an information received last minute with wrong information about boarding time. Boarding was a mess. Finally I got into the plane and the entertainment system did not work. Not good this time.",0
Great experience as usual with KLM. Service on the ground was friendly and quick. Boarding was swift and comfortable with biometric gate scanners. The crew was professional and friendly. The seat was comfortable with generous recline and gold legroom. 2 meals were served. Pasta and a sandwich before landing which was great. Recommended!,1
"Was meant to fly KJLM from Amsterdam to Munich before connecting on Oman Air to Bangalore. When I arrived at the airport they told me the flight was overbooked and I had to go wait at the gates until it was boarding time to wait and see if there will be any no shows, although I had arrived at the airport 2 hours early. Initially the staff were incredibly rude. The staff did not want to help except for one exceptional women who I wish I got her name, went the extra effort after realizing how distressed I was. After a long time discussing things with her and her calling her senior staff I finally managed to get a seat. I would not recommend this flight to anyone. You must be able to check in online and have no other flights to catch.",0
"Abbotsford to Winnipeg via Calgary with Flair Airlines. Awful. Nickles and dimes customers for higher rates than competitors and refuses any accomodation or leeway when it comes to flight cancellations. They follow the law to the bare minimum and have awful customer support. Avoid, avoid, avoid.",0
Very pathetic service. This airline don't have any respect towards the customers important time. They don't care whatever work they have. Or they will be able to travel after arrival or not. It feels like standing at a local bus stop for bus. The the nonsense crew doesn't have any idea of anything if you do enquiry. It's not first time I'm facing this. One or twice we can understand. But every time and with all my know people who frequently fly. They all try to avoid this nonsense flight. It always spoils all the planned work.,0
Delays. Long lines outside when arriving just to check bag or in. Only airline doing that all others had no lines outside. Rude staff at gate desk when asked simple questions. On this flight waited 20 minutes on runway for a gate. Waited longer on our flight in on the runway. Never flying Spirit again. Customer service other than flight attendants is terrible.,0
"I found Ryanair fast, efficient, organised and value for money. Cabin crew were friendly and very helpful.  Would certainly recommend Ryanair and will certainly travel with them again.",1
"Flew American Airlines from Miami to Charlotte. Flight was late 30 minutes because of flight crew mix up and now we have been waiting over an hour for our bags at baggage claim. Its now 1.20am, no announcements, just people asleep that don't care about the customers waiting. 3 other flights have come and gone. Where is the customer service?",0
Flight was supposed to leave at 3.38. Flight was delayed by two hours. When they finally decided to give us information they said we would board in five minutes. 30 minutes later still nothing. After an hour they told us the flight was delayed even longer due to mechanical issues. After waiting they decided to cancelled the flight until the next morning. All we were given was an eight dollar voucher for food. Steer away from Allegiant.,0
"Flew with my 8 month pregnant daughter who had required doctor signed Ryanair paperwork which she was never asked to show. Had just cabin bags on the outbound flight but with family bought baby presents on the return it required a case being put in the hold. Getting assistance to do this from the Ryanair desk staff was like ""pulling teeth"". Dismissive unhelpful arrogant and rude summed up by the comment from one Ryanair staff member with the statement ""I can't be out here just helping one member of the public"". I enquired what was the minimum number she could help? Priority booked and seats reserved only to be herded from one queue at the gate to the next queue at the entrance of the air bridge then on to the queue at the aircraft doorway 20 minutes standing during intense summer heat. Not the sort of treatment to subject an expectant mother to. Not one member of staff took the care or comfort of this pregnant lady into account. The only smile came from cabin crew when trying to sell their overpriced beverages. An appalling airline worthy of their reputation of flying their customer in ""Cattle Class"".",0
Thanh Hoa to Ho Chi Minh. My friend recommended VietJet Air for my holiday trip to Taiwan. He showed me some tips to get a very cheap ticket even for free from this airline. Moreover not only just that affordable price I also feel so comfortable when flight with VietJet. The crew are young and willing to help passengers with their request.,1
"This airline is cheap for a reason. Terrible customer service and random cancelations. We had a flight from LAX to Reno and they just cancel it without any reason as to why it was canceled, so when we tried to call them all their phone lines are busy or not working. This company is a disgrace and should go down under. They never even helped us refund our flight, just get a voucher, which they still haven't replied about.",0
"Had a great experience. Flight was early, no issues at all with boarding. Keep in mind they only allow a small carry on and backpack. Crew was very nice. This was the first flight where I could actually be able to fall asleep!",1
"Terrible experience from start to finish. My suitcase was flagged and held up for half an hour and in the end there was nothing wrong. My daughter and I were separated, even though we have the same reservation, and when I asked why, I was told that it was a full flight and they can't help us. The boarding and flight were delayed. No one told us anything while we waited and the staff was discourteous.",0
"Toronto Island to Montreal. A cancelled Porter flight due to mechanical issues even though it was a quiet Sunday morning with spare aircraft around and every passenger fitted onto the next flight easily. Disappointing customer Service. No apology. Won't be using Porter anytime soon. Despite a nice service on the flights, they are unreliable.",0
"Keflavik to Toronto. Simply my worst ever flying experience! I kept calling as line check in did not recognize my booking number, waiting time was very long and customer service agents very difficult to understand. I was told my number was correct and I had to wait until 24 hrs before flying, still did not work, called 3 times on day of flight as wanted to check in to ensure my family sat together, was then told booking number was incorrect and to try a different one, still no good, eventually paid extra over the phone to reserve seats. When getting to the airport I was told to check in at a machine, guess what? Booking not recognised again so queued up. There was a very long queue and only 2 desks open, 2 other staff just sat there filling in forms, we queued for nearly an hour and was down to 50 mins to departure. I spoke to staff several times to open other desks but they said others were busy and most staff were at the gates, eventually got to the desk to be told my seats had been given to other passengers despite me showing my email confirmation, again they were uninterested and shrugged shouldsers, my family ended up all split up including quite young daughters. The plane was the worse legroom I have had for a near 6hr flight, extremely cramped and uncomfortable. So it is fair to say will never use Wow again, iny opinion they are terrible and any saving is just not worth it.",0
"Flew from Montreal to Frankfurt. Plane was a 777 with the new livery. Boarding was completed without any problems. The legroom was decent and the personal IFE had plenty of new titles and a wide variety of songs. I wish AC offered Inflight WiFi like LH or TK. The dinner was okay, however, they were out of chicken when they came to my row so I didn't have any choice. The 'breakfast' they serve was just a slice of banana bread which wasn't good. The flight attendants were really sincere and did their job well. We departed Montreal with an hour delay and I had a connection flight with just an hour of layover, so one of the flight attendants informed me that they are aware of the situation and that they would relocate me to a front row business class seat before landing. I made it to my connection flight thanks to them.",1
"I flew China Southern Airlines from Sydney to Guangzhou on 16th January. Since it was pretty crowded in the economy, I decided to buy an onboard upgrade to business class. The flight attendant told me onboard upgrade only covered the seat, but she did let me have a try on the food from the business class anyway. The deluxe soup noodle was so good. I also watched a movie from a wonderful onboard movie collection. It's a great experience they provided.",1
"LaGuardia to Washington via Orlando. Worst flying experience ever. The airline Nickles and dimes you for everything made me take my grandbabys toys out of the boxes. Staff was every rude, my first time flying with this airline, and never again.",0
"Singapore to Zurich in May 2013. In April, to my knowledge, SQ 346 is very often packed and seat reservation might be difficult if you are two but on a different booking. On this particular flight I took a so called P seat which is next to the exit. Actually there is a lot of legroom left on the other side of the metal, there's permanently cold air coming up from the door. As often for a early morning flight 01.20am people are some of harshly due to sleep shortness. The cabin crew is very patient even if some become aggressive sometimes.",1
"I have previously flown with Garuda to Bali several times and was happy with the service.  This year we had to cancel our trip due to my wife being diagnosed with Cancer. Garuda has promised to provide a refund but keep avoiding paying the refund. Allianz travel insurance would cover the cost of the flights but won't because Garuda promised a refund. I have been trying to get a refund since March. I email Garuda every week and keep getting the same response ""we do apologize for the inconvenience. Regarding your inquiry is being internally process, currently we are still waiting for confirmation and we will inform you shortly after we get the information"".",0
I booked some extra baggage for a flight but Jetstar added it to the wrong flight then charged me excess baggage fees then would not fix it. So hard to contact them also. Worst airline I've ever experienced!,0
"The flight from Puerto Plata to Toronto was cancelled due to weather conditions. Other airlines were also cancelled. However those other airlines received notification that their flight was cancelled. We found out when we reached the airport. They rebooked us for a flight out and put us up at another resort for a day and a half. Thank you. Then they started rescheduling flights. I received 4 different emails with 4 different flights changes. This was confusing but we figured it out. Finally reached Toronto. Confusion again. Some customers received hotel vouchers, some didn't. The representatives were so unorganized it was painful. Confusion once again. Customers were confused enough but westjet added to it and left us with the feeling that they had no idea how to handle an emergency situation. Westjet unfortunately is unable to provide good service outside of canada.",0
"Winnipeg to Montreal. Had a wonderful experience. The plane was changed the night before the flight departed which caused some issues for those traveling in the plus seating that Westjet offers. However, they managed to keep everyone who had paid for plus seating in a plus seat with minimal issues. It was an earlier flight and the crew were very friendly and kind.",1
This airline is a joke do not fly them unless you really need to be somewhere and there's no other option. I had to book a flight to see my mother before she died then I had to change my ticket for obvious reasons and they didn't care about the reason they still just wanted my money. They wanted me to pay a change fee that was as expensive as a new flight they put always profit before people. I ended up buying another ticket from them because that was the next available flight. This is really the worse service by far I have ever received from an airline and there are many really bad ones out there. Many airlines would have compassionate waivers in cases like mine but they don't care. Do yourself a favour and never book a flight with Aeromexico!,0
"Louisville to Ft. Lauderdale. I fly this airline multiple times a year, and you get what you pay for. They will delay the flight one hour at a time until you have been wait for 5 hours. This has happened more times than I can count in the last few years. And good luck trying to get a hold of someone on the customer service line. I honestly wonder if anybody even works there or it's just a answering machine. I will never understand why they wont just tell people the flight is delayed until the last minute. I don't mind to wait I just don't want to sit at the airport for hours. And many people I have spoken with feel the same way.",0
"I checked into the airport 5am on the 11th June. I'm a wheelchair passenger. I was told someone would be with me shortly. I sat for almost an hour waiting. Finally a lady told me they were short staffed so I would have to wait so I waited. My flight left for New York at 6.15, I barely made my flight and I was the last one on the plane. My flight on the other hand was ok. Would fly with Frontier Airline as long as I'm not in a wheelchair.",0
"This airline is awful. Do not use at all, especially if not a direct flight. My family was returning home from Orlando and just before boarding was to begin we were notified that the plane was running a few minutes late but connecting flights should be fine. Then we were told it would be a few more minuets because the plane landed on the wrong side of the airport. Once we finally got on the storm front had reached us, around 30 min after we were supposed to already be in the air. 3 hrs later we were forced to deplane. By this time our connecting flight was already gone. American Airlines logged the delay as due to weather and refused to book us on another airline so we were forced to take our first flight to Charlotte, 5 hrs after the original time, or risk not getting out from Orlando until Monday, 5 days later. Now that we are here there are no flights where we can stay together to travel so I have to take one of our 5 year olds to Phoenix for a 6.5 hr layover before finally getting to Minneapolis. My wife and our other two children have to sit at the airport from hotel check out till 4pm before their flight. American Airlines seems to have just used the weather to their advantage to get an easy out so my choices would be to fork out 4000 to fly home via delta with a 1 hr layover or take what American gave us. This is ridiculous and if you are reading this...stay away from American Airlines.",0
Frankfurt to Konya via Istanbul. This was my first time flying with Turkish Airlines and I loved it. It's great that there was no delay or any other problems that may occur. The cabin crew was friendly and food was excellent. The seat was comfortable and I had enough space to put my legs in there. Overall I had a good experience for a good price.,1
"I used to like flying frontier 4 years ago, used to fly into Denver quite often and the seats were comfortable. But my recent flight this month to Las Vegas was a nightmare. I blame the airline. Their new seats are nothing more than resin lawn chairs which won't recline with minimal padding. I upgraded on our return flight to reclineable seats but they were still uncomfortable. I will never fly them again. I have no problem paying for comfortable seats but even their upgrades leave a lot to be desired. They used to be good, but not anymore. I equate them with Ryanair over Europe who I will never fly. Sorry Frontier, but you have lost my business. The skimping on the seats have made them so uncomfortable that I would rather drive 24 hours to a destination than fly the hours on one of your flights.",0
"Hong Kong to Kuala Lumpur. My first time boarding this airline. Very friendly, polite, cheerful cabin crews and excellent service. Food and beverages is very good and actually better than their sister airline Cathay Pacific.  Will definitely recommend them to other travellers. Will fly them again in future.",1
"Clean cabin, helpful and friendly service. Most of my fastjet flights left on time. I used Fastjet between Dar Es Salaam and Uganda, South Africa and Malawi.  Flights were over 75 per cent full, especially Uganda and Malawi. This is a budget, no Frills carriers. Flights were smooth, great service and clean cabin.",1
"It was quickly apparent that Emirates were carrying out a savage cost cutting program. The Seating was impossibly cramped such that the first three days of my stay in the UK were spent in Warwick Hospital with a DVT. Food on the Plane was scarce and inedible, and drinks even scarcer. The Attendants did their best but were clearly hamstrung. It seems a very short sighted unimaginative approach will destroy a once admired Airline.",0
"Lanzarote to Berlin. Upon boarding the pilot announced that the plane is too heavy for the fuel to be enough and so we will have to land in Frankfurt to refuel and only then continue to Berlin.  An hour delay before departure in Lanzarote, after boarding. Another hour refueling in Frankfurt and in total we spent almost 8 hours in the plane for what should have been a 5 hours flight. The plane landed just 15 minutes before the 3 hours delay which would have entitled us for compensation by European law. On the plane we were never offered any kind of complimentary food or drinks. We were not offered water. The toilet door handle broke during flight which made the front toilet unusable until the refuel landing in Frankfurt. We would've chosen another company if it was possible but they're the only ones flying direct. I will also mention the flight there from Berlin was delayed two hours after boarding.",0
Monarch airlines are too basic. Although we had issues Monarch made our 3 hour journey to Corfu in August very dull and boring. No entertainment no blankets or pillows on night flights and the food had no variety and was a rip off. Whilst sitting on the flight waiting to leave we saw our luggage being taken off the plane then later we were told they had put the our luggage in another plane and theirs on ours so had to wait for the swap! Lovely staff though and great pilots.,0
"I know that it's a budget airline, but it was quite frustrating. Going to Kalibo, the flight was delayed by almost 3 hrs and we were compensated with a banana chocolate loaf and water. Going back to Manila was worse. They moved my flight to 4 hours earlier and if that wasn't annoying enough they actually delayed it on the day. I left Kalibo at 3.20, close to my original flight time but instead of doing my planned activities I had to wait in a crowded airport frustrated. This time no compensation. ",0
"Delhi to Paris via Helsinki. This is the worst airline I have flown, the least helpful one and hence I would not advise anyone to fly this airline. My mother and I had the same type of ticket, the same number of finnairplus points, and whereas I was able to get a business upgrade, my mother was not able, not because of the lack of seats for upgrade, but simply because there was something wrong in their computer system regarding her reservation.  I could not reach the airline by phone as it said their line was congested, though I tried more than 30 times. I explained my problem to them through their chat on internet. Although two different agents asked me about the details of her and my ticket, once I gave these details to them, they never answered back. So this is a loss of more than 450 euros with which I had bought sufficient points for our 2 upgrades. I am amazed that an airline is unwilling to correct a computer problem and behaves so impolitely.",0
"Never had to wait so long on an aircraft just to take off. The delay was ridiculous and I wish I would've reviewed the airline reviews because all I see is complaints about delays! Never will I fly United again! IT was very hot, uncomfortable and disappointing experience.",0
I recently took a trip to Colombia Jan 22nd 2014 Flight number 9754. This was the best airline for courtesy service comfort and looking after your needs. I would definitely fly this airline again. Adds to the experience when your comfortable on an aircraft.,1
New York to Los Angeles. Couldn't check in online as the system online wasn't recognising all our details. When we arrived at the airport and began the checkin in process we were automatically assigned seats in different rows. We were told they could not change seats because the system was down. We were told that we can select seats at the gate. When we attempted to change our seats at the gate we were flatly told no because we were economy far holders. Was told that next time I should consider paying more. Found them to be unhelpul and rude. Also on the plane there was no WiFi despite it being advertised. Will not be flying with this airline again. American Airlines were far better.,0
I flew last July from DFW to MSP. Until now I've never flown First Class but since this airline's FC was fairly affordable I decided to give it a shot. I was very satisfied. I did not experience any problems on my flight. I would do it again. The food was good the seat was plenty big and the flight attendants were friendly.,1
Sunwing is the worst Airline. I have ever traveled with even when you upgrade your seats and pay for it you are squashed in like a can of sardines. There's absolutely no service whatsoever. Would never fly Sunwing again. They even charge for soft drinks like a Pepsi or Coke,0
"Las Vegas to Hong Kong via Beijing. Everything was perfect except that the flight from Las Vegas to Beijing did not have WiFi and the flight back from Beijing to Las Vegas had WiFi but the service was not enabled once the aircraft was over 10,000 feet as advertised. I hope Hainan Airlines can get the WiFi issues resolved but the great entertainment system they have made up for the lost WiFi ability.",1
"I checked in online for my flight and got my boarding pass well in advance of my flight but when I got to boarding gate they said my seat has been changed. I chose a aisle seat and got moved to a middle seat, not only that my screen wasn't working so for a 9 hour flight. My friend also got a whole glass of juice spilled on him. Horrible experience and I got no reason for my seat change and only got told sorry for the screen, pathetic. This will be both myself and friend's last trip with them.",0
Very attentive staff easy to communicate with. Nice comfortable reclining seat and the food was ok. Flying from Auckland to Moscow via Guangzhou. When I arrived at Guangzhou an airline staff member met me and offered me hotel accommodation as I had a long wait over. I had not asked for this. He then guided me through customs. I have never had that level of service before on any airline! The seats on the 787 were very nice and the entertainment section was fine. The staff were using English as their second language and possibly third so one must expect some less than perfect communication. I hope the return journey is going to be as good.,1
"Flew Cincinnati to Dallas with Frontier Airlines. The airline lost our checked car seat and the only solution they offered was to give us a car seat belonging to someone else that they had lost on a previous flight. This car seat was too big for our baby and did not even meet the safety legal requirements in regards to our childs age, height, and weight. The airline offered no other help or service on the problem their inconpetence created. It would have been cheaper to buy another ticket for the car seat as we will be having to buy a new one.",0
"What was annoying is that 2 hours after we took off we had a small lunch, then 5 hours later we got small tiny sandwich and small chocolate bar. Then 1 hour before landing an omlet and some fruits. So terrible for a 14 hour flight.",0
"By the time they added additional fees for seats and luggage, it didn't seem to be much different in price from other airlines. The seats don't recline very well and when you do, your causing the person to be even more uncomfortable as the seat limits their leg room. The seats are uncomfortable so if you have any physical ailments such as knee or back issues consider yourself in pain. The leg room is a joke and they pack you in like sardines. No water or anything. The cleanliness is poor too.",0
"Bangkok to Los Angeles via Hong Kong. Cathay Pacific cancelled my flight twice just because it tried to fill up more flights due to the lack of customers from coronavirus. Refused to offer any changes without fees. Food garbage, customer service non existent, prices not cheap.",0
"Hanoi to London. The main complaint was regarding the food, we did not eat a simple thing. Not much leg space either. We did not have any choice of aircraft due to going on a organised tour.",0
"Cape Town to London via Dubai. Friendly, helpful flight attendants as well as staff on the ground. Food is decent. Forgot duty free bag on transit flight and there were no issues retrieving it on flight back home.",1
"Patna to Mumbai. Really worst experience twice. They delay at last moment and leave you with no option. Once they changed the flight timings and didn't even forward me the revised schedule. The second time I had to wait for the flight for 3 hours, being delayed again and again. I would now prefer not flying rather than booking a SpiceJet flight...",0
"Newark to Toronto. I received an email that our original flight time from Newark to Toronto was cancelled and rescheduled but when we went to check in, the woman asked us if we wanted to take an earlier flight out. Frustrated with the cancellation we gladly agreed, only to go through security, check our bags, sit on the actual plane, to be told to get off the plane as only I had been moved to the earlier flight while my friend was not. After getting our carry on back, we were lectured by the airline attendant that this was our miscommunication. Due to this, my friend and I doubted that our luggage would be placed back on our original plane and not lost. I do not recommend this airline what so ever.",0
"Would never recommend it. No service no management just catastrophic from Sabiha Goecken Airport Istanbul. Very long queues no one supporting, very rude staff. No one knows where to go, what to do. Worst service ever.",0
"Beira to Johannesburg. I'm very disappointed with this airline. I have a shuttle service which I use to travel from Johannesburg to Witbank Mpumalanga 110 km from the airport. Got to the airport to check in for my flight to Johannesburg, supposed to leave at 13h10 to find out flight has been changed from 13h10 to 15h20 Beira via Maputo then to Johannesburg. Now I'm screwed as I will miss this shuttle service which i paid for and it's non refundable at last minute. This airline does not take responsibility for their actions. This is not the first encounter I have with them. I really would not recommend them for the future.",0
"LGW to SZG. Absolutely useless for a scheduled service and would not recommend to anyone. Booked flights to Salzburg for travel in September way back in April and chose the 13.45pm flight as most convenient even though more expensive. Luckily we arranged an overnight stop in Gatwick as we live in the North of England as otherwise don't know what we would have done when our flight was cancelled with notice only being given about 9.30pm the night before. We were put on the 7.15 am flight which meant being at Gatwick for 5am. This is a much cheaper flight but no partial refund is available its take it or leave it with BA. Our subsequent onward travel plans were also in disarray because of this and it was a most unpleasant and stressful start to our holiday. Having taken the trouble to complain to BA I am amazed it took 8 days to send a most unsatisfactory short response which ended with ""we hope you fly with us again to restore your confidence in our service"". BA need to learn that scheduled service means just that and plans are made around the timings that cant just be altered with no notice. I would not trust or travel with them again.",0
"My flight from Las Vegas to Tampa was cancelled one hour before boarding without a reason, they sent me an email. We got a new flight in another airline from Las Vegas to Ohio and then another one to Ohio to Tampa , we were in the airport 6 hours waiting and then another 2 hours in Ohio. Never travel with this airline.",0
"It was my third flight with them this year. Quick flight from Winnipeg to Grand Rapids on July 17, and return on July 19. Smooth checking, boarding, clean aircrafts, on time departures and great service provided by ground and in flight personnel. Tickets a bit over priced, although at the same Delta provided great service. The only thing that could be improved are the snacks in economy.",1
Excellent service all round. Spotless planes excellent service smiling crew could not do enough to assist. Entertainment options were adequate and food was good.,1
"Arrived at the airport 2.5 hours ahead of my scheduled departure. When I arrived at the ticket counter to check my bag, I was advised my flight had been cancelled at some point late last night or early in the morning due to a flight crew issue. I was placed on a flight that was four hours later than my original flight. All other flights were full so I had to enjoy my six hour visit at the airport. My complaint is for this reason only, other airlines I fly give you email updates when a flight is delayed or cancelled. If American Airlines had taken this approach I could have possibly made another reservation or at least, hung out in my hotel for another four hours. Instead I had to hang out in an airport for six hours.",0
Indianapolis to Jacksonville. Both flights were delayed. Not slightly but by hours. Not weather related. I fly frequently with standard airlines. Tried this airline once and only once.,0
Flights WG589 on 28th April and WG590 on 5th May. I have taken 3 trips to date with Sunwing planning a fourth in September. I have never had a problem with this airline and wouldn't hesitate to recommend them. We had a situation 2 weeks ago on a flight to Cancun where we had 3 wedding parties start the party early one passenger even started smoking in the toilet! The cabin crew handled the situation well. I felt sorry for them. Delays happen not always the fault of the airline. I usually pay for elite plus seats makes a huge difference.,1
"Honeymoon ruined and a huge expense incurred by this incompetent, unprofessional airline! We were flying from Sibolga to Medan where we had a connecting flight with another airline but a dog got on the runway at takeoff. So we had to wait over 5 hours until we could take off so we  missed our connecting flight. I asked the staff at lion air to help us but they were totally unsympathetic and refusing responsibility and we had to buy replacement flights with Garuda air instead. I understand that I have rights as a consumer in Indonesia and was at least supposed to get some money for the inconvenience of delay, but we got nothing but scowls and lies. They lied about the delay and as it got worse and worse.",0
"Keflavik to Luton. Terribly disorganised, for no apparent reason, claimed we could not take our travel size carry on when the tickets clearly stated we could. Staff do not know what they are doing. Delayed both journeys due to incompetent staff.",0
"Honolulu to Seattle. Delta has stopped all drink services and they give you a snack bag. The aircraft luggage bins were nasty, the lavatory was in disrepair. There were flight attendants in tee shirts.  They have lost touch with their customers and their roots. Was like a bus ride, sad.",0
"A very disappointing experience and Gulf Air has deteriorated greatly since I used it regularly 5 to 10 years ago. Cabin crew were reasonably polite but not particularly helpful and couldn't solve any issue. The quality of food was lamentable. Even though my flight via Singapore was very long and at night, no blankets or pillows were available. Toilets were dirty and cabin crew did not seem at all concerned to keep them clean.  Gulf Air seems to have become on a par with the most basic budget airlines.",0
Yangon to Adelaide via Singapore and a great experience with Singapore Airlines. The food has improved since previous journeys. Crew friendly and happy to help. The IFE was sufficient for the routes flown with plenty of options. Even on the shorter journey the attention to detail was evident. Both flights couldn't be faulted.,1
"We were 2 pax traveling Oslo to Luanda via Brussels. We did have some negative vibes after having read some reviews but the connection was good and price attractive. Turned out to be a wrong choice. It started out with an overbooked flight from Oslo and an advice that one of us would have to stay behind. Only after reminding the ground crew that Luanda is an not an easy destination to reach, that we had confirmed tickets and that we hold Star Alliance did we get on board. The flight from Brussels to Luanda was just not good. The cabin looks and feels fresh and clean, food is acceptable but there end the positive comments. The seats are nothing but horrible. In theory they may be ok but that's only on paper. You feel cramped with little legroom and the backrest has a hard area that sticks out and makes it difficult to lean properly back. The recline is ok but as long as you have someone behind you, reclining is not an option. The fact that my traytable was very loose of course did not help. In my 40 years of intercontinental travel, I've experienced worse seats but that was a long time ago.",0
"Tijuana to Mexico City. I am a usual Interjet customer and starting 2017, I will quit flying with them. It seems like they have been over estimating their poor ability to organize themselves on time. I have been flying on Interjet for last 3 years almost monthly base, and their punctuality gets worse to the point of being not acceptable.",0
Singapore to Amritsar. The services are very poor. Everything is paid and quality is very poor. They don't even provide free water to their customers. The behavior of the crew towards the customer was also bad.,0
Two Tiger flights. Sydney to Mackay and Mackay to Melbourne. Inflight staff on both flights were extremely happy and friendly making both flights very enjoyable. One flight arrived early the second flight was late but pilot and staff were very apologetic But all went well. A good safe flight.,1
"Worst experience ever! We took a flight on 1st April from Amsterdam to Luton and the flight was delayed two hours without any announcement! The gates opened on schedule but we had to wait 2 hours past the initial departure time. On the 3rd April we returned back to Amsterdam and again there was a delay of 3 hours! The worst airline ever! No information was given about the delay, no serious apologies, people were left clueless on the airport just waiting for the flight to arrive. I feel worse for people who had to go to other cities and the only option to reach home was by taxi. The expenses that come along with that are even more than the ticket price. Such a terrible experience, and I will never fly with Vueling again.",0
Baku to Ankara. Baku to Ankara. Buta Airways charge 25 euros for carry on luggage if you have budget class tickets. This practice is misleading. I will avoid this airline in the future.,0
"Las Vegas to Houston. Not only was my flight delayed due to mechanical reasons, you also do not get complimentary drinks. Then they lost my luggage and about 20 other passengers. My first and last time flying with this airline.",0
Rapid City to Phoenix. On Tuesday night our flight was canceled due to plane problems. Which can be understandable. But the next day all I got is delay delay delay emails when I tried to call and get more information it was like pulling teeth. What I do finally arrive for my flight they say it is now going to be another four hours late even though there was one taken off earlier which no one had contacted me or let me have that option. Very poor communication.,0
Very good experience. We flew from Barcelona to Jerez in April and then from Seville to Milan in May. All flights were on time and smooth. We had no complaints.,1
"The flight caught a lot of delay caused by the arguments about the luggage of one passenger. So after 55 min we were finally in the air. Apologies were said in a way ""we must do it"" unfriendly FA, poor information from the cockpit. You have to pay for drinks and even in business the drinks are served in carton cups. In Hamburg 40 minutes waiting for the luggage",0
Never again! Our flight from LAX to Dallas Fort Worth was 2 hours late. When we boarded the plane the attendant that you usually see greeting you was busy on their phone. The attendant before take off checked the overhead compartment while sighing as if she didn't want to be there. The attendants were overall unpleasant. When we left Dallas Fort Worth to LAX we received the same greeting. The flight was an early morning 6.20 departure and I realize everyone is very tired in the morning and that perhaps the passengers have the right to sleep during the fight but I certainly don't think that the flight attendant should be sleeping in their seat at the back of the plane. My luggage is in Las Vegas and I am 4 hours North of LAX. The seats on the plane so small need not recline back. So uncomfortable! When I booked this flight I was excited that I had found airfare for family of 4 at such a low price now I know why! I think what bothers me the most is that the attendants weren't very attentive and we're too busy with their social media to be bothered by the passengers.,0
"Knoxville to North Eleuthera via Miami. One mechanical problem followed by another, compounded by a breakdown in ground equipment caused a 5 hour delay at our origin. As a result, we missed our connection in Miami despite scheduling a 3 hour layover. This caused a 24 hour delay. As a result we miss at least one day of vacation, a day we have to pay for. The information provided while waiting on the tarmac for almost 3 hours was infrequent and unhelpful. ""Customer service"" was provided only grudgingly with every attempt made to provide minimum assistance.",0
Horrible service. I can't check in and there is never anyone from their customer service to help. Even worse is they thought it was a good idea to go all automated so you can't speak to a person when you need assistance. Should have known this is one of the worst airlines to fly. The CEO should be ashamed to be in charge of such a terrible company.,0
Frankfurt to Tokyo. Simply the best airline even in economy. You feel like you are an important traveller. Cabin crew is so kind and gentle. I am an anxious traveller and they come so many times to know about me. The meal were so good and the snacks are at your disposal when you want. This my second time with ANA and if I could I will always fly with them. The Pilot made a smooth landing in Haneda and smooth take off. One of my best flight. You can bring two luggage of 23kg in economy class. This was the best for christmas gifts.,1
Worst experience I've had flying and I fly a lot. Received an email 3 days prior to departing that my flight was cancelled then a few hours later receive an email stating that was sent by accident. Fast forward to departure day get to the airport to find out my flight has been cancelled and they don't have another flight for 2 which would cause us to miss our hotel reservation and other flights plus a day or more of work.,0
"I always look forward to flying LOT Polish Airlines. I know I can count on the great service. Food is always tasty as well. My last experience was as expected, great. From the time we stepped on the plane to the moment we stepped off. The cabin crew were courteous and helpful. They were patient and ready to offer assistance to all passengers. It was another great experience. Thank you LOT for providing great service and taking care of your internal and external customers.",1
September 16 2013 my husband daughter and I flew from Athens to Toronto. Unfortunately when we fastened our seats belts and were ready to depart our captain mentioned that we would be stopping in Paris to get more fuel. I do not understand how a direct flight includes a stop to get gas. Secondly customers should be warned beforehand because we would have booked another flight if we had known about this stop. We arrived to Paris at 3.45pm making it a 3 hour flight with an hour late departure from Athens. Told we would be leaving shortly but unfortunately an hour wait turned into a 6 hour wait. During this time we were told by a crew member that something was wrong with our engine and we would have to wait and see if it could be fixed or not. The way we were all treated was unacceptable! We stayed onboard for 6 hours we were not given water or food during this wait. We understand that safety is first and that mechanics were working on our plane but no one thought of the passengers. After 6 hours the captain told us that there was a computer problem and it had been reset but then we were told that because of our crew we had to stop again in Newfoundland. After 13 hours on that plane we were fed with a meal. We constantly asked for water and were told that the crew would be coming around for everyone and after waiting an hour no water was given. In the end we will never fly with Air Transat again and we would not recommend Air Transat. Our 8 hour flight turned into a 20 hour flight.,0
"Toronto to Edmonton. Big shout out to the crew and passengers on this Westjet flight. The almost 4 hr flight was lovely for my 9 month old and I due to the kindness of everyone on board. A special thank you to the 2 male flight attendants who treated us like gold, made my daughter laugh, and did not get upset over the many Cheerios squished on the floor.",1
"Breeze turned out to be a great airline. Staff was great, plane was clean and very nice, seats were roomy. Plane was on time going and just about 20 minutes late leaving Las Vegas . All of our luggage went to a different airport in Florida but they were in contact with us before we reached the terminal and stayed in contact until they had it delivered to our house by the next day. I will definitely be using Breeze in the future!",1
"I did not even have the opportunity to take this flight, but I wanted to share my experience with their customer service department. I called to cancel my flight and receive a refund due to the time being changed on my flight. When I called, the person taking my call informed me that they could not refund my money because the tickets had been purchased through a travel company and that the airline did not receive payment for the tickets. This was clearly incorrect because I had an airline confirmation number, confirmed seats and flight numbers. Further, my deposit for the trip was the price of my airline tickets and my 'Cancel for any Reason' fee. When I asked to speak to a supervisor, the American Airlines representative was angry and told me that I needed to call the travel company. I told the person that I already did and they informed me that I needed to contact the airline. When I asked to go through the refund process with the airline, the AA representative told me that it would be denied. I became firm and told the AA representative that I wanted to go through the process anyway, and he hung up on me. I will never fly with American Airlines again. Their lack of customer service and humanity to their customers is ridiculous.",0
"I will never fly American Airlines again!! You have no idea what social distancing is, but you make sure to threaten people about the mask while on flight every chance you get! Even though your stewardesses aren't going by the rules or is the guy flying the plane! No food at all except pretzels and a water, and when you say get that mask on or you won't fly American again, I am the customer and you don't talk to us that way! If I could give you a zero I would!",0
"Absolutely the worst experience. Flight from Anchorage to Denver was delayed over 2 hours due to a ""monitor light being on"" or at least that was the explanation given. Once the issue was cleared, we still sat with no movement for close to 30 minutes. Most of the passengers had connecting flights that were ""rescheduled"" however it was physically impossible to make the rescheduled flights as they were departing mere minutes after this plane landed. Thus, over an 8 hour wait at the Denver Airport for next connecting flight to Florida. The app is not helpful and updates are given at the last moment, if at all. Not flying United again and would not recommend to anyone who values their time.",0
"Montreal to Beijing. Worst airline company, this is the only Chinese airline which refused to provide full refund for tickets cancelled before Jan 28. The government set up policies about refunding but this firm is just playing word games.",0
We flew from FL to Houston on February 25th and had a great experience. My husband and I flew with our 10 month old son and he was very hyper. Our flight attendant was a blessing and very attentive. She found another seat for the passenger next to me so she didn't have to be bothered by our young son and we could stretch out. She also made a glove balloon for our son for entertainment. At the end of our flight another male attendant gave our son a souvenir wings and booklet. Overall they made the flight more comfortable for us.,1
"Varanasi to Jaipur. The flight timing was changed without any information. I am an old lady and was waiting at the airport for more than 4 hours, without any assistance from the airline members. On asking why has the airline not informed, they gave me an excuse that sms to all members have been sent and it is not their responsibility, if I have not got the sms. No courtesy at all.",0
"Had a very pleasant trip to and from Kathmandu. Total flight was so smooth. Crews and staff were absolutely professional. Check in and other ground activities, other than immigration were very fast in Dhaka Airport.",1
Jacksonville to Washington. I think I won't ever fly domestic economy flights by United again. On the way to Jacksonville from Newark the flight was delayed for 3hrs so my car rental was closed by the time we arrived. On the way back the flight was first delayed and then cancelled. Too much.,0
"Never in my life have I had so many delays. Also, their system has some sort of glitch today so apparently that means that had to cancel a ton of flights and delay many others. I'm in the military and needed to be home by midnight because that's when my leave ended, no one could help accommodate me and the people at the check in counter were not very friendly. I will never fly United again.",0
"Auckland to London via Seoul and I recommend Korean Air. The service onboard was very good and flight attendants were delightful, providing service with a smile. The food was pretty good. The flat beds were comfortable and the film selections were current. We enjoyed our flights. The overnight stopover in Seoul at the Grand Hyatt was superb.",1
"Houston to Las Vegas. After staff asking for volunteers to give up their seat for a credit, room credit, etc. I went up to the front to offer my daughters seat because she was not traveling with me today. Instead of being offered a credit I was told if I was cancelling her seat I would need to pay a cancellation fee! Supervisor on duty was opposite of helpful.",0
Worst service. Had one AA rep tell me he was to busy to speak with us. Delayed flights. Put on other flights that also were delayed so American Airlines wasted one day of our vacation. Then because we were group 9 to board they would not let us take our cary on. So now we have to go to baggage claim adding even more time to what has become a terrible experience. I will never fly American Airlines again.,0
We flew long haul from Manchester to Cancun on 17th Oct returning 31st Oct. After reading some of the reviews on here I was dreading the flight. I can only say we didn't need to worry from check in to landing each flight was great. We paid extra each to have just 2 seats together at the back of the plane as my partner likes to look out of the window and I have a bad right leg so would have more room to stretch. This wasn't needed as the leg room was great even for my partner who is over 6ft. The attendants were very nice even though they were very busy. The food was good for airline food. We knew b4 hand the cost of drinks so bought water and coke at the airport. Never watched the films so I had put films I wanted to watch on my kindle so going I watched these and read a little coming back the same. My partner slept most of the way both trips and he said the seats were very comfy.,1
"I had the most fantastic experience flying back from Atlanta. We were lucky enough to be upgraded to Premium Economy. The staff went out of their way to make the trip a very special one, providing blankets and serving drinks and food, it was done in a professional and courteous manner. I would have no hesitation in recommending Virgin Atlantic.",1
Rome to Tel Aviv. Paid by mistake extra weight and have not received refund even it was long time before the flight. My hand luggage was at the dimensions and weight under the maximum limits. Without any reason they don't allow me to take it into the cabin. Other luggage belong to other people that were bigger were allowed to take it to the cabin. I will not fly again with Ryanair.,0
"While I am 6'4"" I am hardly a giant and I cannot sit in the seats without my knees pushing into the seat in front. I was not informed at booking that it was a Rouge flight but I will avoid at all costs. I do not mind stripping amenities to reduce cost but making the seats so awful is ridiculous. What is this an airline for ants?",0
Bali to New Delhi via Kuala Lumpur.  No inflight entertainment and no free food given on flight. One has to pay. They defend that position by calling themselves a budget airline. Seats are uncomfortable. I'm  going to pay extra and travel with some other airline next time. The positives are that the staff is courteous and the flight is on time always. In fact they're before time.,0
"I travelled from Heathrow to Helsinki return with Finnair. Outbound was on a Airbus A320. This flight was full and left and arrived on time. The return was on the new Airbus A350 again leaving and arriving on time. The A350 is a very nice aircraft, very quiet and nice mood lighting. I had an exit row seat which gave masses of leg room. I am not sure this would be my choice of plane for long haul, my wife and I select our flights by seating configuration i.e .pairs of seats of which the A350 has very few, mostly 3x3x3 , which can be a pain over distance. There was full IFE on this flight which I did not use. Only coffee, tea and juice served .I did not make any purchases.",1
I haven't actually been able to fly yet. The airline cancelled my flight. Did not offer any type of refund or change flight to a different airline. Apparently I'm just stranded and they get to keep my money. I have to call my credit card company to report a fraudulent transaction just to get my money back. Whatever happened to good customer service?,0
"Abu Dhabi to London on 10th May. My worst flight ever. The cabin crew were the laziest I have flown with. I realise they are entitled to a break but they entered the cabin twice during the flight once with lunch and once for a snack near the end of the flight. My sister could not even get any water, the crew ignored the bell and switched it off without even coming to see if there was a problem. After lunch was finished the curtain was closed and if you went to use the toilet behind the curtain you were told to use the one at the rear of the aircraft. I will not be using Etihad in the future.",0
London to Hong Kong via Stockholm with SAS Scandinavian. First I flew from London to Stockholm and I haven't received a glass of water for free. I had to pay for absolutely everything. Than I flew for 10 hrs to Hong Kong and the only drink I received for free was a can of coke. Low cost services at high prices. The airplane was clean and staff was very nice. However this is not enough.,0
"I had 2 major surgeries in Puerto Vallarta and was in a lot of pain. We just needed to get home. The stewardesses, went above and beyond to help us, one let me get a personal water bottle and both of them kept checking on my husband and I. I was last to deboard and they both helped us. I can't say enough on how grateful we were that they took the time to care with do much sincerity.",1
Sydney to Albury Dash 8. Wonderful service with breakfast friendly efficient staff smooth trip. Have booked another return trip Sydney to Albury with special requirements and the staff couldn't be more helpful.,1
"Chicago to Jacksonville. Traveled with my granddaughter and the same luggage both flights, they tried charging for carry ons on my return home. Called me rude threatening to not let me board the flight. Cost me to lose more than 200 dollars worth of clothing and to have an anxiety attack. I won't ever fly Spirit again. I know I've recommended Spirit in the past but never again.",0
"El Al has the best Premium Economy product on this route, US carriers don't compare to the seat pitch, width and comfort, impeccable service from the flight crew , the food served on china, a large selection of IFE, and even the goodie bags. I like the curtain they use to cut off this section from economy.",1
"Zvartnots to Los Angeles via Doha. Comfortable seat in the flight, friendly service, ease of moving in the airport, great ticket price, compliant with COVID 19, very helpful customer service.",1
SGN to Pakse and return. Will someone please give this airline the four star rating they deserve? Cheerful FAs on time departure and arrivals clean ATR 72s and Airbus 320s and free Beer Lao. Even the coffee was good on my flight into SGN this morning. I cannot recommend Lao Air highly enough.,1
"New York to Mumbai via Dubai. Comfortable, clean and modern aircraft. In flight entertainment excellent. Food was decent and warm. Customer care is poor. The flight crew are running around doing whatever they feel. Most of the time they are sitting in the middle talking to each other. I have been flying internationally for last 15 years and this was the first time a crew member got upset when I made a request for water. In between meals no beverage provided. Even when meal service was being done, one of the stewardess rushed past everyone so that no one could order. This airline is not worth your money. Please spend a few more bucks and go to Qatar Airways where you will be respected as a human being or go cheap on Etihad as they are worth what you pay. Emirates no longer cares about its customers. I regret spending my money and keeping my expectations high with Emirates. Never will I fly them again.",0
"Had 3 hours delay at the airport in Kenya and what was funny was to be told they cannot trace where the plane was but it was already in the country. Asking them that they need to send a message for my connection flight that there will a delay, they advised that they will send and email. Upon arriving at OR I was told there is nothing they can do and there was no email sent and they just need to book accommodation and in the morning I will have to come back to the office to meet their manager. They could not assist and had to buy a new flight for the missed connection flight as they did not take responsibility knowing that I missed the connection flight because of their delays. At the booked hotel, were told that was a daily occurrence with Kenya Airways, they have 10 or more people booked because to those delays. They have less planes and need to use same plane when it lands.",0
"Hyderabad to Kolkata via Aizawl. They cancelled flights before any lock down was done by the Government, that was understandable due to the current situation, but the fact that they do not reply to any email about refunds, or their customer care number which doesn't get through even after multiple calls per day. This is by far the worst customer service.",0
"Do not book with this airline. My family and I all booked to go to Hamilton island for my 50th birthday but due to COVID we could not fly, I tried to get a refund and they refused. I had to accept a voucher. A year later my parents are not well enough to travel and they refuse to give our money back, what kind of good company would do that. I will never use this airline again, good customer service would have been giving our money back without the stress and would say I hope you can book with us again in the future however this airline has no such thing as good customer service so I have to get our credit card insurance company to take up this matter take them to court to get our money back. I have 5 children that need my money more than Jetstar do, what a terrible company.",0
Rochester to Newark. I asked to have a seat reassignment the attendant told me they won't even look at it then the flight is late because the airport did not have a power pack ready to power up the plane.. Horrible customer service and performance by United to meet their obligation to their customers.,0
Flew Kulula from Johannesburg to Durban. Long wait. Under staffed. Rude. Asked for seat with leg room and he put me in back seat with no leg room. Awful. This isnt the first time. Particularly poor is the attitide of the check in staff. Also not well presented or dressed but mainly lack of service.,0
Travelled Auckland to Port Vila this last weekend. For such a short hop to Vanuatu all aspects of the flight were excellent. As this trip was for a long weekend travelled with hand luggage only. Crew on both sectors warm and welcoming not to mention hardworking.,1
"On both ways, we had the last seat on the planes 26A, 26B, 26C, and 26D. These seats do not have any window and there is not enough space between these seats and the front seat. We had a baby with us who was sitting on the legs of his mother. That was scary because the free space between the baby and the front seat was less than a hand palm. We didn't have an extra scale for the back seats. There was only one scale at the front of the Airplane. My husband forgot his Polo Ralf Lauren hat which he placed on his seat. He realized it immediately when we were on the bus on the way from the plane to the arrivals. Because it was late and with the baby, it was difficult to go back to get it, so I called the next morning the lost and found department of Volotea in order to inform me how I can get the hat. The answer was that nothing was delivered to them and to call again the next day which I did but again the answer was negative. No hat has been found.",0
"Lima to Trujillo. This airline offer good price only for locals and overcharge to international customers. Then the flight was late and I arrived later because delayed. The airplane was there yet but they didn't let me check in my luggage because they affirm that the flight was closed. How they can close a flight which airplane is behind and has not arrived yet. I requested to talk with the supervisor and ignored me saying that the supervisor was busy helping another person. I was with my 1 year old baby and my grandma of 83 years old, my daughter and husband and I was mistreated by their personnel. Ignoring my situation and condition in that moment. I came to Peru after 5 years and my day was so far pretty bad due to these people.",0
Denpasar to Lombok. 2.5 hours delay and counting on boarding. No response from the airline staff or gate staff about the expected boarding time. The pricing for the ticket is cheap. However it is known that the Lion Air always delays. Pick a different airline.,0
Nashville to Pittsburgh. I had paid extra for A group but turns out there were already 15 to 20 people on the plane from the previous flight that all moved to the front on the plane. This is not a fair way to board. If they leave the plane they should re board with everyone else and if they choose to stay on thru should remain in their original seats. I feel scammed for paying the extra money to board in A group and I will not fly southwest again. I asked the agent at gate C 22 about this and she looked at me like I was the rudest person for asking why this is. Not at all happy with Southwest.,0
Some of the cabin crew were extremely rude. I was forced to fly American Airlines via British Airways and I would never want to wish this on my worst enemy. Please stay away at all costs.,0
"I booked my flight and Wizz Air just sent me an email a few days later saying that they changed my flight date without my permission and i had to accept it via my account on Wizz Air, which i could not because i did not have an account. So i made an account, i found my flight but i could not accept it or decline it. I tried to reach a representative in Greece or Cyprus but guess what they do not have one. Anyway i accepted the change by calling at one representative of the countries they do have horrible English. I could not check in online so i had to pay my check in at the airport and now i can not reach to them again. I cannot check in online. I will not travel with that airline again.",0
"Brisbane to Shenzhen on 3rd January. First time flying with Hainan Airlines with much disappointment. I paid extras for the preferred Economy seats but I need to change as there is no point for speaker to be plug into when viewing movies. When I brought up, an attendant recommended me to watch mute movies. I asked another attendant mentioned about changing seats but the screen does not work at the new seats. I was told if I need to watch any movies, I will have to make do by watching from the screen beside me. Such helpful advice!  A male attendant tried fixing the screen but was unsuccessful. But I must admit that he did try calming me down.",0
Dubai to Libreville via Kigali. Was comfortable with flight as cabin crew were attentive and available. Clean and arranged flights all the way through. Didn't enjoy transfer at Kigali however as Airport was not as organized as flight.,1
London to Auckland and return. All faultless. Flights on time amenity kits hot towels and decent food. The crew worked hard throughout the flight regular water rounds and snacks on offer. We were not put up at the Hyatt this time but the Ramada Songdo a little way out. This is my second time with Korean and I look forward to flying with them again.,1
I flew from Sacramento to San Antonio through Denver for my sisters funeral. Not the best time to be delayed by a full hour and have to rush to the next flight just to make it before doors were closed. They excused themselves saying it was the weather. But here it is 3 weeks later flying home and not only was my first flight delayed but so was my second flight. There was no room for all the luggage and people had to put 5hem under the plane. While I am delayed my spouse is driving 3 hours to wait an hour. I had to feed my children in the airport expensive cheap food. Never again will I fly United. They need to quit booking flights till they can get their seating under control and their flights timed right. They need to get their act together big time..,0
"I will never fly United Airlines again. Poor service, almost they don't serve food. Flight attendants are having fun together, they are talking laughing and we are waiting for the lunch. Only two hours flight left and no lunch has been served yet. I am starving.",0
Paris to Newark. Sitting in a lounge for hours without any information. We are told that there are delays due to possible mechanical trouble. Feeling absolutely ignored. Will never fly with this airline again!,0
"Flights cancelled by LOT in early June as London CIty Airport was closed due to Covid. Refund request still not processed, they advise patience ... mine has now worn thin. Can't get through on phone lines, can't get a refund or proper estimate when they might pay out. Never again !",0
Excellent top notch service that you would expect from a Premium Carrier's Premium Cabin. Food was good staff helpful with good attitude. IFE miles above Virgin's.,1
"Dallas Ft Worth to Missoula. 2 hours and 15 after scheduled departure and leaving the gate for the second time. Left first time 15 min late, sat on tarmac 15 minutes, then decided not enough fuel. Took 45 min to get back to the gate, took another 30min to get person to pump the fuel, took another 30 minutes to leave the gate for the second time. Utter incompetence! Do not book with AA unless you have no other option.",0
Flight from Christchurch to Guangzhou. I had flown from New Zealand to Guangzhou quite often and China Southern Airlines has been always my first choice. Staff are very nice and hospitable. Facilities of the cabin are very well maintained and food is nice. Will choose China Southern Airlines again for next trip.,1
"Mumbai to Manchester via Dubai in business class. Overall, an excellent experience. The refurbished seats on the B77L were extremely comfortable and spacious. Certainly an upgrade from the dated seats on the 77W. A380 to Manchester was excellent. The ground staff in Mumbai were very helpful and attentive. The chauffeur service is one of the best features of flying with emirates. The complimentary WIFi was useful to stay in touch midair.",1
Tampa to Chicago O'Hare. Started getting texts early morning for a slight delay after 6 throughout 7 hours our flight delayed 5 hours and all they offered were free snacks. Our entire day was wasted sitting in Tampa airport waiting for a plane to show up. Their customer service desk was less than helpful and sympathetic.,0
Ft. Lauderdale to Nassau. Getting the ticket and checking the bag was a breeze the fun began while waiting for the flight I was chatting and wasn't paying attention to the time however others were. No one bothered to tell us the flight was delayed although on the screen checking in it advised it was going to be on time. We took off an hour late. Also on our return trip we were an hour late. Never again.,0
"Denver to Fort Lauderdale. Avoid avoid avoid. I will never fly United again. There are weirdly cryptic baggage fees, consistently late flights, and horrible customer service. If you can, I would advise steering very clear of this airline.",0
The overnight flight Papeete to LA was cancelled without notice. We were booked on the flight 12 hours later which meant we could not make any connecting flights that day to JFK as we arrived too late. We were given an hotel room for the night before the flight but had to fend for ourselves in LA for the enforced overnight stop. The reason for the cancellation was not made clear but I would suspect it was none other than not enough passengers as cancellations seems to happen frequently. The same flight the previous evening had also been cancelled. At no time did anyone offer an apology. I would not recommend this airline as they are unreliable.,0
"Austin to Orlando. The boarding process was clear and smooth. The cost of the flight alone is worth taking a trip. The flight attendants were wonderful, caring and thoughtful. I observed them taking care to assist each passenger who had an issue or concern. They took the time to listen. I find that so important in a society that lacks active listening. I was ill and before I even said a word, all 3 jumped in and offered assistance to help me feel better and checked on me the entire flight. The plane was clean and comfortable. I have and will continue to share my experience with others as I continue to fly Allegiant!",1
Seattle to Los Angeles. This is the worst airline ever. I had to check my bag in because there was not enough storage when in fact there is so much storage on this plane. We have been waiting at the gate to take off for an hour now. Everything about this airline sucks. I was supposed to be in LA by 1 but looks like I will be home by 3 pm.,0
"I will not use Copa Airlines again even before I have flown it tomorrow. The are unreachable by phone until I used the contact number for Canada from the US and waited about 45 minutes. Their app is horrible. When I tried to enter my credit card, it required that I select a country. However, the United States of America or USA were not on the list. I checked it 6 times to make sure. The website is just as bad. I tried to upgrade seats and pay. Each time it rejected my credit card. Tried this an unbelievable 9 times before I accepted their stupidity. Quite honestly, after this experience, I am afraid of what actually checking in and flying is going to look like. My first experience with Copa and very well will be the last unless something miraculous happens tomorrow when I fly.",0
"I wasn't allowed to bring on board my small guitar, I had to pay 60 dollars to check it in as special luggage! The flight was half empty and I could always keep it under my seat.",0
"Okinawa to Taipei. I checked in at the counter and they charged me for extra luggage. I paid, then the check in staff tells me that I will not be able to board the flight due to a technicality. I asked for a refund on my luggage. I was told to contact the airline. I did. They argued with me. Gave me a lot of attitude. Finally the informed me that they would issue a refund for the luggage charge in the next 4 months. They told me that they are unable to confirm my refund by email.",0
"Almaty to Istanbul. I use Air Astana for my domestic and international flights, I can say that they are best option for the region. The quality of service, aircraft quality keeps increasing.",1
This was a horrible trip. Supposed to be a 4 day weekend. 2 days were used traveling thanks to American Airlines changing our flight to a much later flight in the day leaving Philly and adding a layover. No explanation for that but customer service was very unhelpful and my call disconnected twice after being on hold forever. Flight home was delayed all day. No reason given just hours of delays. The worst part was they damaged my son's tuba in transit and absolutely refuse to accept responsibility for their bad handling. They tried to imply we caused the damage. Absolutely infuriating to basically be called a liar. Baggage claim representative did not care one bit that the tuba is permanently damaged thanks to their negligence. Awful airline. Terrible experience. Bad customer service.,0
"Unpleasant check in process, waited in line for about an hour without telling us anything, after updating their boarding terminal very last minute so everyone had to run to the other terminal in Paris. And I've never needed to check in again for a connecting flight in such a short connecting time, not sure why Play had everyone do that.",0
"Aircraft and inflight crew is good but ground crew treated us poorly. We were traveling with three kids and booked flights online with difficulty as their system was rigid and insisted on us buying infant tickets when we wanted a dedicated seat for one of our twins. We got to the airport and everyone said the plane was completely full. This includes front and at the gate. We were forced to check in one of our infant seats but promised we would get it back during our layover in Istanbul. It did not show up in Istanbul and everyone gave us a run around for two hours. We finally gave up and at our destination, no big surprise, our infant seat was missing. ",0
"Newark to Vienna. First time flying with Austrian but not the last. Very pleasant trip from back in the cheap seats. Cabin crew relaxed, friendly and professional. Food and drink adequate for the class of service. Triangular food containers a neat touch. Cabin appeared recently refurbished. Standard seats had plenty of pitch and width. IFE was up to date but my wife's was inop on the way out. EWR departure very convenient for us vs JFK. Express train from VIE to city center convenient, clean and very reasonable. For return flight, checked in at the train station saving time at the airport. Overall, highly recommended.",1
Mexico City to Los Angeles. Great customer service. Staff was honest and helpful with any assistance we needed. I would recommend the Delta service in Mexico City,1
EK404 Dubai to Singapore 777ER300 14 April 2014. Left around 30 minutes late but arrived on time into Singapore. Cabin crew excellent meal was excellent with the crew constantly wandering around the plane handing out drinks and snacks. In flight entertainment was excellent. The trip was just on 8 hours long during the day but thanks to the service and IFE the time flew by.,1
Flight from Athens to Vienna in business class. Very nice service from the crew and a fantastic breakfast. Aircraft was a new airbus A319.,1
We were flying from San Francisco to Philadelphia. The first thing I saw when we checked our bags in was how nice the staff were and there was peaceful music on with colorful seats. In a good mood we started to board. I noticed they had screens on the back of seats were you could watch TV play games and order food and drinks. It was the best flight I have taken! I will be coming back.,1
"Flew Frontier Airlines from Salt Lake City to Grand Rapids, Michigan. Rude. Boarded 35 mins late. Get on the plane, sit there 40 mins. Then they make us check a bag below when this very bag has been on 8 of their flights in the last 6 months. Further, they measured my bag and said it was fine size for a carry on. Then, they make the entire plane deboard. Now we are 1.5 hours late and waiting. This is unreal. The staff are so rude. They make you pay for a soda, after all the add ons you've paid double the ticket cost. They lost my business today. On the way to my moms funeral. Nice!",0
My wife and I used Icelandair because of the cheap price I got for the Saga Class on a Trip from Seattle to Paris. On the first leg of the trip from Seattle to Reykjavik my entertainment console malfunctioned even after it was rebooted. A complete waste of time for me. My wife's worked fine. On the trip back it worked OK but the screen was smaller than flight from Paris to Reykjavik. Otherwise I liked the service on all flights.,1
Really bad airline. Rather than provided accurate information eg flight is delayed until x just kept providing an estimate of when the flight is to land. Never ever been on a flight with them that is on time. Very unreliable airline.,0
The Brussels Airlines Business lounge at Brussels is terrible! Friendly staff in the airplane. Seats are not very comfortable. Food is moderate. I forgot my reading glasses in the plane. The same day I reported this to the service desk with the exact place were I forgot this. Till this day I got no answer. ,0
Rekjavik to Amsterdam. This is the worst airline ever. The flight was delayed over an hour on the way to Iceland which made us super late to our appointment on the island. I forgot to take my travel sickness tablet and the flight attendants refused to give me water and asked me to pay for it when the flight took off. Luckily the person sitting next to me offered to give me water. On the way home there was only a 20 minute delay however baggage claim took over an hour to get which made us miss our next flight. We were not able to check in our luggage for our next flight as we had 30 minutes left and the flight was already boarding passengers. Because of this we had to book a new flight to get back home. We were stranded at the airport.,0
"My Daughter and I flew economy but paid for extra legroom. However, this was by a door that had been open to allow supplies in, in a storm and had soaked the entire carpet, seat and seatbelt. The entertainment monitor did not work for the first two attempts of resetting by staff and was very frustrating. My daughter put her hand into something that smelled of vomit when she was retrieving the monitor from her seat. The assistant woulnt move us as he said they was no other seats although it was obvious there was. The last straw was when my feet got wet due to the sodden carpet, my daughter's bag got soaked and the wall of the plane was dripping a dirty yellow substance. A cold, uncomfortable journey home with no sleep.",0
Flown on the A380 from LAX to Incheon last October. Business class is located in the upper deck and the overall experience was something to repeat. Great service great IFE with a wide selection of movies and shows not only in English but also in Spanish and Italian. There is very nice bar in the back of A380 where a wide range of tasty and perfectly prepared Martinis are served. It's a good spot to meet some other fellow passengers and to exchange a few words. It reminded me of when traveling by plane had its glamour.,1
"The worst airline that I have traveled. The flight was late more than 3 hours and they kept the passenger in the plane for nearly one hour before they take off, after that they even offer a bottle of water. It was the first time that I traveled with TAP and the last time.",0
"The captain of my flight didn't have any explanation for my 2 hour delay. I was late to my next flight, got to the gate the plane was there and they did not let me board. Closest hotel they could get me was 20 miles away. I've decided to spend a sleepless night at the airport. Thanks United! Most other airlines ran fine. The customer service line was at least 200 people long. I refuse to fly with them ever again.",0
Flew Istanbul to Izmir. The flight was on time and the plane was clean. Overall the crew was friendly. Even though the flight was only around 30 min we still got served sandwiches. Considering how cheap the flight was it was really worth it.,1
"Generally a pleasant experience. Cabin crew provided good service and check in at Rome was reasonably quick, our baggage arrived with no problems. The inflight entertainment was only average. Overall better than we expected.",1
Flew to Bangkok via Muscat on their new A330s. Excellent cabin space and service can't fault either leg. We normally fly Qatar and Oman just about matched them except for the hub. Muscat is not a patch on Doha with it's dedicated business terminal.,1
"La Guardia to Detroit. I was with 3 others on April 14th catching a flight from La Guardia to Detroit. The weather was fine but according to Spirit Airlines, it was not. Our flight was cancelled.  The manager refunded a customer and paid for their hotel in front of us but would not refund us our tickets. I will never fly Spirit again.",0
"Great airline, offers everything one needs. Very efficient and friendly staff and service on board is great. Very good quality food and drinks onboard. Kevlavik airport is easy to navigate because of its size. Can recommend all aspects of the trip.",1
Flew Mykonos to Athens with Olympic Air in Premium Economy. Check in was polite and efficient. Aircraft was clean inside and out had seat 3A. Pre take off drink was served. Left on time and a filling and tasty snack of pasta salad and a cake was served with a drink by 2 polite and professional cabin crew. A very comfortable flight and we landed on time. Would recommend Olympic Air and would choose them again.,1
"The worst airline ever. Do not fly this airline unless you don't care if you make it to your destination. They canceled my flight today for no reason and no explanation given. They had no other alternative flights. This is the second time this has happened to me. They, by far, are the most unreliable airline. Service is poor and they run a cattle car system. Not worth the time or effort to trust this airlines with you travel needs.",0
"This has been the worst experience ever in flying. First we were late leaving Columbia, MO due to lack of personnel. Then in Chicago we loaded and unloaded 2 times before being stranded for the night. The flight is scheduled for tomorrow morning. So I will be sleeping in the airport tonight. No accommodations was offered! This is totally unacceptable! I will not be flying United ever again!",0
"Flew with GA334 on 16 July. Bad luck for me, I got Boeing 738 without IFE. Crew served hot meal, although the flight under 2 hours. It was pleasant flight.",1
Flew on Dreamliner Melbourne to Brunei. Flight departed late due to airport only using one runway. Spent 90 mins on tarmac waiting to take off. Biz class cabin has only 3 rows. Seat was comfortable enough and the provision of a large pillow was great for sleeping. Service was excellent food was equal to other airlines and IFE adequate for all but avid movie buffs. Missed my connection in Brunei due to delay in Melb. Was met on arrival guided through immigration and sent to hotel for overnight stay. Flight to KL the next day was equally as good.,1
Terrible customer service. No way to follow up on lost baggage once you are outside usa keep getting sent from one place to the next. No international number to call,0
Used TAP from Amsterdam to Oporto on board a Fokker 100 operated by Portugalia. Flight left on time. Wonderful hot meal offered and fruit portions small but tasty. Crew were professional and friendly. Check in and boarding was smooth. Bag delivery at Oporto took rather long was not busy our flight was the only one arriving. A good experience and everything on board free including spirits.,1
"Qantas truly back on track. Amazing service and staff. Wonderful food, amenities, everything was top notch. From the check in process to boarding, on board and baggage.",1
We flew business class Perth to Sydney on Xmas Day and Sydney to Perth Jan 17 one may expect Xmas spirit. On the Perth to Sydney flight I asked the stewardess for a glass of water and champagne about 30 mins after takeoff and was told to wait till they served the food in half an hour. She then walked off and it took 10 mins to get another stewardess as they were all in the food area with the curtains shut. Finally got a drink of water and then when food came around I was informed that from a choice of 4 only 1 was available as they had run out of the others. It was a one third full business class section and we were the second to be served! I questioned this and she grumblingly walked off and found me an omelette. We never saw the staff without having to ring the bell. Sydney to Perth again I was told to wait until the meal was served before I could get a drink of juice and wine. I got better service in economy. But the male crew were fabulous friendly and brought us drinks without having to wait until the food was served. Seats were frayed and vinyl split some of the reclining buttons did not work. Food very average. Very poor female crew and overall and I will not fly Qantas business class out of choice ever again. I will go back to Singapore Cathay Air NZ and Virgin.,0
"Hobart to Adelaide via Melbourne. We checked into our flights the night before and on arrival at the airport checked in our luggage, printed boarding passes and attached bag tags. We then waited in a queue while one staff member processed the ever lengthening line, including doing the complete checkin for most of the others. Meanwhile, even Jetstar had more staff and efficient processing. Not sure why we bothered doing the right thing by Qantas.",0
"Tokyo Haneda to Bali via Manila. The flight from Haneda to Manila was ok. It was a good new aircraft and the flight was also smooth. The flight from Manila to Denpasar was not so smooth. When we reached Bali, we waited for our baggage for around 1 hour but still there were no sign of any new baggage. When we confirmed with baggage handling service that handles Philippine Airlines, they told us that 40 baggage were left at Manila. We had to wait 2 days to get our baggage. While returning, again the flight was delayed by 1 hrs. we had only 1.5 hrs of transit at Manila and the flight was delayed by 1 hrs and there is a unique system in Manila airport that you need to present your boarding pass to transfer desk, stamp it and only then allowed to go through security. We were lucky to get in front of line and get on our plane right at the end of boarding time. Don't expect personal entertainment system in the plane as most of the plane do not have them. In addition, board the aircraft as soon as possible and ask for the blankets because they have very limited amount of blankets.",0
Guangzhou to Melbourne CZ321 on May 17. What a wonderful airline with genuine good honest service. A few of the Australian airlines could take a leaf out of their book for sure. All the staff were most friendly.,1
"British Airways from London to Rome, almost perfect on my last 3 flights. Food was edible, the flight attendant very pleasant. The problem with them is their policy to make people pay to choose their seats, very Ryanair.",1
"On June 27 I flew from Sacramento CA to Seattle to take Icelandair flight 680 to Iceland only to find out that the flight had been cancelled without me being notified. No flights back the same day so I had to rent a car to drive back to Sacramento, about 14 hours. Vacation gone so no way of even contacting the airline. Customer number just a recording pointing you to one place or the other on their website. Icelandair is is the most dishonest company I have ever done business with.",0
Sun Country Airlines the worst customer service I have ever seen. Trip of a lifetime to Alaska tainted by lost luggage for two days now and the only thing they can tell us is it might be here tomorrow. No guarantees no proof that they even know where it is and NO compensation for lost time at the airport waiting for it or for items that had to be replaced.,0
The worst airline ever. The airport employees are rude and have the worst attitude. They do not try and help and above it being their fault they get an attitude towards you. Even if you paid for insurance and coverage they do not respect their policies.,0
"Great experience. The cabin crew, Food, Seat comfort, Wifi all the things were great. Glad to have a safe journey with Vistara. Satisfied with the journey.",1
Flew to Mauritius and my experience was unsatisfactory. The service was appalling. I pressed the hostess button numerous times with no response. One meal throughout the journey was inadequate with a very small snack before landing. My snack was a soggy sandwich and breakfast was no better. I will not recommend this airline. Quality is of the essence.,0
"Oslo to Lisbon. TAP is the worst airline I have ever encountered with regards to customer service. They significantly changed the departure times for both flights without notifying us. We discovered this at check in, 22 hours before the flight, and this resulted in one of the travellers having to rebook a connecting flight. TAP customer service confirmed that we had not been notified when I called them. We made a written complaint to customer service as soon as the trip was over, and waited 13 weeks before we were asked to provide more information. I have now waited another 4 weeks, and still no answer. This is unacceptable in terms of customer service.",0
"Traveling home and canceled flights and couldn't rebook for a whole week, had my children with and left us high. Very disappointed in this airline, shame on you for leaving not only me but other customers in a bind and make other arrangements. Had to get a car rental which was way more then my ticket!",0
"I arrived 2 hours before my Spirit Airlines October 31st flight from Dallas to Detroit, only to be told when checking my bag in that my flight was cancelled with no explanation at all. I was told very nonchalantly that the next flight out would be Monday, November 2nd at 8 pm. I was given a hotel voucher, but I could not use the transportation vouchers given to and from the airport because no taxi service I could find would take the voucher. I was also given food vouchers which were only good in the airport, and were worthless because I couldn't take my luggage through security and since my flight was canceled and I didn't have a boarding pass. Although, I got on a flight the next day rather than a 2 day mess, I was booked in someone else's seat. To top it all off, customer service was rude while working through all of this and on the plane. It was one nightmare after another. It never feels good to be traveling alone and be stranded.",0
"After a 36 hour journey, I arrived at LAX to find that the flight showing confirmed on the Qatar app had no record of my booking. I spent 30 minutes on the phone with Qatar trying to get on the flight. Qatar told me I'd have to stay in LA for 4 days. While we were talking, the flight closed. I ended up paying cash for a ticket home on United. I have another flight with them in 4 weeks. A similar nightmare is unfolding. Rebook for a lower class of service, give up my premium seat on a 38 hour flight or pay cash for my own ticket from Reno to LAX that I already paid Qatar for. Be prepared to be stranded. Make sure you have enough cash to buy an alternative ticket home!",0
"Buffalo to Orlando. Best airline ever! Flight attendants were the friendliest and the pilots amazing! My special needs granddaughter was able to get her picture taken with the pilot. The front flight attendant had a great sense of humour and was a very caring person! I would never hesitate to recommend Southwest Airline.  Honestly, best airline experience ever!",1
We had booked an Air NZ flight but with Star Alliance ended up with a part journey Heathrow to San Francisco on Virgin Atlantic. I had the misfortune of getting sick during the flight. Once they realised I was sick and not in need of emergency medical help they ignored me and my flight was awful. Never made any effort to assist. They said they would get our carry on bags taken for us. As we had a family of five with small children we had a number of bags. As soon as I took a step off the flight they decided they could not. You can imagine my feelings towards them at that point. Should be avoided at all costs.,0
Oakland to Orlando via Houston. Our connecting flight was cancelled. We left at the airport for two days till the next flight. There was nothing offered for this problem other than sorry. We are 1000 miles from our destination! They don't free yo only refund that second part but we still have to find alternatives as they offered nothing. We paid the what others were offering and choose this airline for it depart time. Never again we will fly this airline. Caused a lot of stress and money. Avoid this airline.,0
"This has been the most horrific experience I have ever had with an airline. Losing lots of money, getting no sleep, ruining my vacation. No one at Delta will do anything to compensate for the extraordinary damage they are presently wreaking on my family.",0
Absolutely the worst airline ever. Paid extra for a nonstop but found out at the last minute that they diverted us from a 1 hour flight from Phoenix to Vegas to a 5 hour flight with a two hour layover in Dallas. Horrible experience. I would rather walk!,0
"Edmonton to Abbotsford. This is the first time I've given a company 1, but when the agent recommends you book with a different company that speaks volumes about the company. Swoop did absolutely nothing but lie to us for our 6 hour delay for a flight that is only 1.5 hours long. We waited over 3 hours on the phone to speak with someone in regards to cancelling our flight. The service was horrible and they kept telling us there is nothing they can do and they are unable to help us. I get its a budget airline, I'm ok. Paying for every single thing but I'm not ok with being disregarded as a customer. Never will I fly with them again and I'm sorry to Westjet cause they were always so good to fly with but this will impact my decisions about westjet moving forward as well.",0
"Another good experience on American. This 10 hour flight was very comfortable and I was happy with all the elements. Flagship lounge was great, food was quite good and the service was efficient and very friendly. Only complaint is the entertainment system which had plenty of content but awkward to use with many unresponsive moments. All in all, in my experiences these last two flights, American is upping their premium game.",1
"Dublin to Bangkok via Abu Dhabi. Chose to travel business class for extra comfort on long haul flight. Unfortunately chose Etihad apart from seats being more comfortable everything else was the worst of economy I have ever traveled on. Daytime flight from Dublin leaving 7 30 am, given lunch menu, no breakfast just coffee and biscuit, lunch served. I requested it at 12 Irish time. My inflight TV system wasn't working was given small tablet to watch a film. After lunch which would have been maybe 14.00 Irish time lights turned off as if night flight.cabin crew no where to be seen. Late landing in AUH so boarded next stage of journey to Bangkok. Sat on plane 4 hours due to technical fault. No refreshment offered.again cabin crew in galley.no help.i asked for refreshments was handed an open packet of nibbles one of them was eating. .i did complain to customer service.have been offered 400d ollars credit. to use on future flight. O explained would not not be doing a long haul light again in the next year but was told take it or leave it the matter is closed as far as they are concerned. The return flight was ok but as most of journey was overnight slept most of the time.",0
"I paid for and flew first class from Cedar Rapids to Las Vegas on American Airlines on November 23 2018. On the DFW leg of the flight I had reserved a meal for this flight. Everyone in first class was served drinks and a meal before me. I thought it was rather strange, but I didn't say anything. After everyone had eaten the attendant told me that they did not have my meal. The meal that I had pre ordered! I was then given a snack box. They told me that there was no record of me ordering the meal. Even if I had not ordered a meal I think I should have been served with the other passengers. I received 5,000 frequent Flyer miles for my trouble, wow!",0
"Santiago de Chile to Concepcion. I thought the onboard service was going to be expensive, but no. The prices are the same as you can found everywhere, and you have a large choice of food and drinks, hot or cold. In some flights they can't heat it because the flight time is too short, but this flight lasted 45 minutes and they were hot. The interior of the plane is well preserved, despite its age",1
"Arrived slightly late for this flight and was told it was on time and that check in had closed and I had to buy a new ticket. When I got to the gate I found out my original flight was in fact late but response was inadequate and uncaring. Boarding was late and when I finally got on I was told that the flight was full and I had to check in my carry on. When I told them I had a laptop in there I was told to take it out and sit with the laptop on my lap. I asked for a bag to put my computer in but got nothing. We waited an additional hour on the runway with no explanation. When I asked the steward he said ""I'm not sure maybe it's because they're backed up"". This was not the first time I've endured terrible delays and ridiculous responses from staff. I will never fly Lion again.",0
"Cebu to Seoul Incheon on a Boeing 777. Seat wise it was comfortable with enough leg space. For a four hour flight to Incheon it felt good, with good service, good food, and IFE! For the price, it was a very good deal in my opinion. Check in was a breeze in Cebu. Even was lucky enough to get bulk head seats. Luggage was checked through so, it was really nice.",1
"Flew Tel Aviv to Rome. Flying business in single aisle aircraft in Europe is usually getting the same seats but without the middle seat occupied. On El Al you get 2x2 configuration with nice business seats and full business service. The seats are hard and manual but its dramatically better vs other options. The service on this flight was nothing beside perfect. Warm welcome, super professional and nice team. Really can be a top service in any airline.",1
"Salt Lake City to Albuquerque. Extremely upset with the service of Southwest. I am a freelance makeup artist and have to fly sometimes for jobs. Have never had a problem with Southwest until now. I check my makeup kit due to the fact I have a lot of liquids and can't have it as a carry on. I had them put a fragile sticker on just as a precaution because I packed it well and it should have been fine. I opened my kit once I get on site for my job and everything is shattered.  I was reassured by numerous Southwest incident associates that since the damage was extensive and puts me out of a job I should be reimbursed. Going through months of trying to get my case looked at and have to deny jobs due to the fact my equipment is ruined they finally got back to me. ""Unfortunately we will not be reimbursing you because we are not liable. Here's a voucher for your next flight"" Thanks for putting me out hundred of dollars, putting me out of a job, oh! But thanks for the voucher.",0
"Absolute awful experience, they cancelled my return flight in January 2022, and no offer of alternative unless I flew by March 2022. I had already booked with alternative airline so only option was to request a refund, did this on 15th December 2021 and have heard nothing since, tried to email in January asking for update, no response. Will never recommend Egyptair.",0
We travelled with Ryanair to Majorca two weeks ago I had booked assistance for my husband due to his mobility problems and found the staff at both ends of our journey so very helpful I cannot thank them enough. It made what l thought was going to be a rather stressful journey easy for us both. We were given all the help we needed in a pleasant and friendly manner.,1
"Budapest to Tel Aviv. Terrible company, with even worse customer relations, no clear indication of the rules for check in. for example, after choosing online check in, we weren't able to do so online and ended up paying a ridiculous amount of 40 eur for each passenger at the airport. Will never fly Wizzair again.",0
"Raleigh to Atlanta. Horrible customer service. I arrived 30 minutes before my flight in Raleigh more than enough time to make it to my flight, there was no line in the security check in. The lady refused to print my boarding pass, she just said I was too late and nothing she can do.",0
"Hamilton to Edmonton. I was travelling with my partner for the first time with Swoop and had the worst ever experience. While we were getting our boarding pass from Hamilton airport, the lady at the ticket counter stated that we have to pay for the bag since to her it appeared big in size. I told her that the bag is flexible and will fit in easily to which she replied that she would charge me double at the door of aircraft if I didnt pay her now. I had no option left and I paid. In the aircraft my bag fit properly under the seat and the crew from forward confirmed that it wasn't oversize bag and I should not have been charged. On her recommendation I got the courage to take the picture and post a review. The crew inflight was amazing but they definitely need to have a good on ground crew with some customer service skills. I am really upset and would definitely want to get the refund for the same. I hate to travel with swoop again.",0
My wife and I flew Auckland to Guangzhou and on to Heathrow in July this year in first class and enjoyed the experience. Only 4 seats and 2 cabin staff to look after us.,1
If you want your flight delayed or canceled book American Airlines. This was an absolutely terrible experience. My flight was delayed for over an hour. Tons of peoples flights canceled all in time for Christmas.,0
"Prompt check in in LHR. Efficient boarding pleasant flight attendants. 1 hour transfer in Paris. Got to gate and boarding had commenced. Not by row. You just queued up and boarded. It was a bit chaotic in the cabin as every one was pushing past to get to their seats. Take off was very smooth and quiet for a large aircraft. Drinks service was prompt and they were generous with the allocations. Food followed which was of a very good standard. Finished off with fresh fruit and brandy. Nice touch. The cabin lights were then turned down for the next 9 hours as it was a night departure from Paris. The crew offered water throughout the night. The ife was very good with a great selection of up to date releases. Seat was comfortable and I had room to stretch out. It felt a bit claustrophobic when the seat in front reclined. It forced you to recline also. The blinds stayed down all flight even though it was light outside, which I thought was odd. Breakfast served 1 hour before landing in Hong Kong. Felt slightly odd as it was 6 pm local time at destination. Again service was quick and efficient. The crew all spoke good English and were very happy in their work. Disembarkation was quick and we all exited via first class cabin. Overall a very comfortable experience, with good food and entertainment. The crew were very happy and provided a good service. I will definitely consider Air France for future flights.",1
"Cologne to Berlin. Probably the worst airline in europe. Out of my last 4 flights with them 1 was canceled, 1 was delayed by 40min, 2 by more than 1.5hours. There is absolutely no service at all from ground staff, they are more occupied with checking the luggage sizes. After my flight got canceled, there was no free of charge hotline available. There was no offering of compensation as part of the EU flight regulations. The seats are super uncomfortable. I am 1.9m and it really is a pain getting in and sitting there for more than 10min. There is no wifi and during the flight I am bombarded with offers of lottery tickets. I am always trying to avoid them as much as possible. Unfortunately there are legs only served by Ryanair that I need to fly from time to time.",0
"Penang to Bangkok via Medan with Air Asia Indonesia. This was my second worst flight experience ever. It is absurd that they do not offer Fly Thru service for International flight connections. It is absurd how small the pitch is between seats. It is absurd they will fill up an A320, with no one in the exit rows because that costs extra, and kick a passenger who relocated there during the flight, how many advertisements are in the plane and that after collecting our baggage and passing through customs, simply to catch a connecting flight, the Checkin Agent insisted I pay cash for an outrageous overweight bag fee because he didn't feel like entering my credit card information into the computer. This is 2017, I can pay anyone for lunch with Venmo, but paying a major airline for a fee is difficult? Are you kidding me? It is absurd they woke me up to hand me a meal which I did not order, only to realize that the meal was for someone else, so they took the meal away.  Wifi on plane? Advertised but doesn't work. Seat entertainment? Not on any planes. T",0
"vRiga to Frankfurt. My favorite airline. Amazing crew, very good pilots and the aircraft very well maintained. I am normally afraid of flying but with Lufthansa I always feel very safe. They can land and go in any conditions and never have delays.",1
"Lisbon to Vienna. All bad. Started by charging extra 27EUR for my small trolley. No Portuguese receipt. Bad seats, little space, bad service. Avoid avoid avoid. Worst flying experience ever.",0
First there was a delay leaving Sydney on Friday then as we got into Melbourne there was another delay. So we had to circle for a good 30 minutes before we were finally allowed to land. Intentionally booked an earlier flight home on Monday 7th October for a family gathering on Labour. Got a text 2.5 hours before flying time to be told flight has been cancelled. No earlier flight home and earliest available is 6.45pm. Well done Jetstar thank you for screwing up my long weekend. I totally understand there are unexpected delay from time to time. But somehow you managed to make this a constant occurrence every time I choose you fly with Jetstar. Think this is where we part ways never again lesson learnt.,0
I have my first time experience fly with Lufthansa in July. My flight from Jakarta to Innsbruck via Frankfurt and from Budapest back to Jakarta via Frankfurt. The quality and efficiency really impressed me. The crews served the meal and drinks promptly. The entertaintement is better than most airlines that I ever took before. The flight departed on time. Check in was fast and efficient. The only downsize was that the seat was a bit hard.,1
"I must say I didn't know what to expect flying Spirit Airlines from Detroit to Las Vegas, I had read a lot of bad reviews and I travel a few times a year but always on a large airline as in a 777. The idea of flying a no frills airliner did not appeal to me however I have to admit it was a little tight in the cabin but it wasn't that bad, as for the flight crew both ways were amazing they engaged in conversation even joking around with us. They took time out at the end of the flight and sang happy birthday to my husband when they found out it was his birthday. So all I'm saying is that it is a no frills airline but if you understand that going in it's really not that bad and if you treat the flight crew with the respect that you and everyone else deserves you will treat you with the same mutual respect.",1
Geneva to Chiang Mai via Beijing. I like Air China. The staff are friendly and has sufficient English language skills. The drinks selection is good and the food good too. There is always a Chinese and European selection. The seats offer enough leg freedom. with 1.80 meters have no problems. The ticket prices are unbeatable. The cleanliness of the toilets could be better. The staff often cleans the toilet during the flight. This is my ninth flight with Air China and definitely not my last.,1
Vienna to Athens. Lot of delays without providing anything for assisting the passengers. Unfriendly ground crew both in Vienna and Athens. Not helping with informing the customers.,0
Ft Wayne to Charlotte. What helpful and pleasant customer service associates. I purchased a non refundable ticket 10 days before the hurricane hit North Carolina in September. American Airlines was kind enough to offer me a travel voucher. I booked for November and then my grandfather died and yet again American Airlines gave me a travel voucher. Above and beyond I love the direct flight from FWA to CLT! And now on will purchase travel insurance,1
"Bangalore to Mumbai . Very poor and nonsense service.  On boarding service staff don't know which gate no flight is coming. After complete boarding, flight stop 20 minutes at same place. Cabin crew don't follow proper regulations. After landing cabin crew announcement please collect your luggage from counter no 1, when everyone reached this there is no luggage. After 10 minutes 1 person come to counter no 1, and told please collect your luggage from counter no 4. Very disappointed.",0
Eldoret to Nairobi. Horrible airline. My first flight with them was from NBO to ELD which was delayed by 4 hours!! My return flight has again been delayed by 3 hours with a silly explanation.  Unless you want to be wasting your time at the airport with delays. There are better more reliable local airlines. Awful experience.,0
"Shanghai to Barcelona via Hong Kong. The 1st flight was late, so we barely caught the 2nd flight. I made it, but my luggage didn't. They told me that they will only be able to deliver the suitcase 2 days later. I was instructed to call the airlines for the compensation. The service is terrible. They never pick up their phone calls and never respond to the emails. No one cares. It is so frustrating. My suitcase was supposed to be delivered 2 days later at 1.30 PM, then in the evening, then the following day in the morning. Seems like I'm never going to get it back. I would not recommend this airline to my worst enemy.",0
"Dallas to Amman via Frankfurt. It's our first time using Lufthansa Air Line, really it was a very nice trip, we enjoy it very much. Ground Service Manager in Dallas DFW Airport, was very nice and cooperative. He was so nice to all passengers. We recommend to use Lufthansa Air Line, they are very nice and professional.",1
"My wife and I flew to Dublin from London Heathrow in Business Class on a Avios upgrade with British Airways. We used the lounge in terminal 5 which had a good selection of food and drinks. We were delayed leaving for just over an hour for technical reasons. Salmon salad and a couple of drinks on the hour flight. Good value with an almost free upgrade, would not pay the normal price for such a short trip.",1
"Our flight with EVA Air was very good. The flight to Bangkok was long and the service was good. The staff were helpful, the service good and the food was better than we expected. On our return flight from Bangkok, I had injured my leg the day before. The staff at check in were so helpful, making sure I had a wheelchair right up to boarding. On the flight, they made sure I was ok, the food, drinks and in flight entertaintment had a great selection. I would fly with EVA Air.",1
"Our Spirit Airlines flight from Atlanta to Baltimore was cancelled due to weather. They offered refunds only and no accommodation or help with other flights. My wallet was stolen during the business trip so I had no ""original credit"" card that they wanted to put the refund on. They had no consideration for me to put the refund on another credit card. They offered to put me on another flight out two days later. The next day I found another flight and could not get them on the phone because you can never talk to a human being. I've emailed them three times for my refund have never heard back from them. Another flight came in trying to get to New York and they hired buses to take them but gave them no instructions, nothing. The passengers didn't know what to do and could get no help. It looks good on paper to save all that money but it's not worth the headache just to save a few dollars",0
Boston to Dublin onboard an Airbus 330. A very warm welcome from the Irish crew members upon boarding the aircraft. Soon after takeoff we were served beverage service and then our main dinner course of which was up to high standards. The main course consisted of chicken or beef. A very tasty meal. The crew members were all welcoming and served the passengers with full courtesy and friendliness. I have to say the crew always work hard on these flights and are a pleasure to have on board. I definitely will be flying with them in the near future.,1
I was having flight from Bangalore to Darbhanga and I fly from your SpiceJet continuously but this time I had a really really bad experience with u guys. My luggage was overweight and I was ready to pay for that but ground staff was so rude. I just paid 4500 extra for my luggage but they should have manners. I will never ever fly from your spicejet it was really the worst experience.,0
"I have been a skywards member with Emirates since 2012. But recently, when I took my pregnant wife to board the Emirates flight from Mexico City to Dubai with a stopover at Barcelona, they inform me that I cannot travel since I do not have a transit visa at Barcelona and it is mandatory to disembark at Barcelona. This was not the case earlier. Emirates Mexico team was sitting on this information for 2 months and have never updated to a passenger. They have my email id, contact number and still they don't bring up this requirement. My wife was travelling to India for delivery and everything was planned. Lack of information sharing by Emirates has brought so much of discomfort to me and my wife. Really bad from emirates.",0
"Zero social distancing, sitting like sardines. Badly damaged my bag that was booked in, had to buy a new one before returning on a different airline. Won't be using them again.",0
"London to Abu Dhabi via Doha. It was my first time flying with Qatar Airways and I was very impressed. Plane was really lovely inside, comfortable seats and 'lobby' entrance with lovely lights effects was stunning. Good selection of food and drinks and professional cabin crew. It was really above and beyond. I recommend this airline for people who looking for comfort and good service. Hope will fly with them again.",1
"I booked a flight last September from Bangkok to Amsterdam in April 2023. Everything was ok until i got a message last night that my first flight was rescheduled to a week later while the other flights were on the date of departure. I tried to contact the airline, but they only have a bot reacting and told me to contact them by phone. After I called the employee told me to change my booking on the website. There were no other flights available so I contacted the airline again and they told me they couldn't help me if there were no other flights available. I asked them how they can reschedule the first flight and not change the rest of the flights. They couldn't help me with anything. Terrible customer service and I wouldn't recommend this airline to fly with. This was my first and last booking with this airline. I had to book a new flight with another airline and getting my money back is also a hustle.",0
LaGuardia to Chicago. I don't know why all the terrible reviews? Other then being a little snug it was a fantastic experience flying with Spirit. Friendly employees from check in to stepping off the aircraft. Thank you Spirit! I'll be using your airline again in a few weeks!,1
"Jogjakarta to Sydney via Bali, and very impressed and grateful for the assistance provided to my mum who flew on her own for the first time. Garuda assisted her all the way even though I didn't make a special request. Cabin and ground crew looked after mum very well and made sure she didn't miss her connecting flight since the first flight was delayed due to bad weather. Thank you.",1
Tel Aviv to Brussels. I am truly appalled by this airline. I will never choose to fly this airline again. They do not provide the minimal needs of the customers such as free water. After 3 hours of feeling very dehydrated and begging for water they provided a cup. I can't believe this is their policy on an international flight to have buy onboard in economy class. I am truly disgusted and disappointed.,0
"Singapore to Beihai via Guangzhou. I chose China Southern through other reviews, and wasn't disappointed. Having experienced economy in Chinese airports, with flights direct into Beijing and Shanghai, I dreaded an international to domestic change at the huge Guangzhou airport. But having heard business class passengers were escorted swung it for me. So paid the extra for business class, and regretted nothing. The seat was comfortable, food was good and well presented. All the attendants spoke good English too. The entertainment could be better I'd admit, but this has been well documented, so I was well prepared with a gapped book and music via my iPod. The escort through the airport was much appreciated as I doubt I could have navigated myself around as quickly. Would I recommend China Southern? Most definitely, especially when travelling business class.",1
"Who knew that this airline was so great! On a short 30 minute flight from Athens to Santorini you still get served mints and a snack. New planes with generous seating I would definitely fly Aegean again. Certainly worth the few extra bucks for great service and comfort. Not 5 stars as Santorini airport is a disaster and although Aegean doesn't own it, would love to see them put pressure on investing in its infrastructure.",1
"Sydney to Paris via London, after flying with them I have to admit it's probably the worst airline I have been flying. When I boarded the plane, I notice some ketchup on the window and wall next to my. I assume for long distance flight airlines should provide you a mask for you to sleep, ear plugs, maybe a small tube of toothpaste. Here you have some headphones and that's all. With British Airways, you can order some special meals. I received my first low callries meal as expected but they could not find the breakfast. One of the cabin crew asked me if I ordered a special meal. The plane looked quite old. I tried BA, never again.",0
"Glasgow to Antalya. First time flying with Freebird Airlines and was a little apprehensive as I had never heard of them before. However, my husband and I were very impressed with the outbound and return flights and the courtesy extended by the Crew. The aircraft offers better leg room than Thomas Cook and the baggage allowance is also much better. I would not hesitate in flying with Freebird again in the future.",1
Aruba to Denver. I am upset due to jetblue canceling my original outbound flight date. Airline declined to reimburse me in any way .. the island I traveled to cancel all inbound flights but not outbound. Due to JetBlue not having and traffic due to inbound flights banned JetBlue is not willing to pick up their paying customers.,0
"Olbia to Stockholm. Incredible flight with SAS! We were the only two passengers on the flight, probably because it was during the Swedish midsummer holiday, and the plane was empty. The cabin crew were super welcoming, and they upgraded our booking to all Inclusive! Best flight of my life.",1
American Airlines sold my seat after their connecting flight was delayed. My son and I approached as they were shutting the door before the actual flight time. They said you missed it and put me on a flight 5 hours later. I had paid for assigned seats and earlier entry but the second flight was separated from my son and last on the plane. When I filed a complaint they said sorry you didn't like it but that is all we are gonna do. Fly another airline.,0
My first flight with Porter and I was satisfied. My only gripe was the check in agent was rude and made me shuffle 2kg to my hand luggage one of my major annoyances when flying really what was the difference if I am just going to put it in my hand luggage? It gives a negative first impression. Security check very fast lounge in Newark a nice added value perk with free Wifi legroom fine cabin clean attendants were great nice snack with wine in real glass! Landing on time immigration in city airport excellent. Overall the price was cheap and I am happy and would fly again.,1
"We just had the worst experience with Akasa airlines. We had booked a flight from Mumbai to Kochi with 5 hours layover in Bangalore. To start with the flight was late to start from Mumbai and thus arrived late in Bangalore. We had 5 hours transit time in Bangalore , so we were hanging out in the airport lounge. But they preponed the flight from Bangalore without any prior information. Obviously we didn't knew about this and missed the flight. Later when we spoke with manager and other staffs of the airlines, they handled the situation quite unprofessionaly and Irresponsibly. As we were transit passengers no airlines can take of the flight without transit passengers. They didn't make any effort at all to get in touch with us initially to inform about the change in the timing and later for boarding the flight. Anyways even after talking with then for a total of two hours they didn't provide us with any suitable alternative options.  We had to book hotel and take a later flight on the same day after 12 hours. The money for hotels, transport and food was just a waste from our side to clearly a mistake from their side. I am writing this review sitting in the above said Bangalore to kochi flight and it's delayed.",0
"Mumbai to Amsterdam. Worst Airline to travel. Extremely rude and unhelpful staff. I needed water and called the air hostess multiple times but no one paid heed. It might sound unreal but I had to wait for 2 hours before someone attended me! When the air hostess finally came, she says we will serve water with breakfast. I have waited for 2 hours to get you and you want me to wait more. Ridiculous. Absolute worst experience. Have travelled so many times through various airlines but even the cheapest of airlines do not have this bad service.",0
Toronto to Manila via Shanghai. Very pleasant  team of staff on all sectors of my trip. Very clean and prompt service. The staff were smiling and trying to help with anything. Amazing experience and I will definitely fly with them again.,1
Attendants will ply you with excellent Aussie wine and very good food. Snacks galore. Unlimited choices on your TV. They provided plenty of blankets and pillows and the first leg was not crowded and they had no problem that I stretched out across 3 seats and slept a few hours.,1
Boston to Phoenix via Sacramento. Absolutely terrible. Poor planning and execution by American Airlines. We waited for food to be loaded onto the plane. Took over an hour. Pilot said someone dropped the ball. Sure did.,0
"Bangkok to Chiang Rai. Return trip as good as the first one. Both legs on time and bags on the belt before us. Again the only issue is the impossibility of check in through your final destination. Leg room is very tight but fine for an hour flight, I am 1.60 so I normally fit well in any airline seat. 15 kg checked bag is included in the price.",1
We connected in Los Angeles from Alaska Airlines to Air Pacific for our Fiji flight. We walked between terminals however the boarding pass issued by Alaska in Seattle was not sufficient to get past TSA at the International Terminal. Wwe felt very rushed at LAX and were the last to board. We sat in Row 28 with no one between us so had an extra seat. My TV didn't work so it was a long 10 hours. The food was fine plenty of it and nice flight attendants. On the return we opted for the upgrade sat in the upper level of the 747 3 seats across each and slept from Nadi to LAX.,1
"Hanoi to Hue. Delays after delays. We have made the mistake of flying with VietJet Air several times. The flights themselves are a classic example of budget airlines. Basic service but cheap tickets. Of all the budget airlines in Asia we have used they are the worst. Our flight was delayed 3 times today, totalling 5 hours. We even paid more for the earlier flight that didn't leave much earlier than the cheaper evening flight. All the VietJet flights out of Hanoi today were delayed as well. This seems to be a trend as they are not punished for persistent delays. Avoid and pay the few extra few dollars for a reliable airline!",0
"London to Delhi. Generous seat pitch. Air India's 788 have 33 inch seat pitch with good leg room. The flight left on time and food quality was quite good. Service was average but nothing to complain. Air India can do better on cleanness and maintenance of plane. Overall, I was happy with flight and service.",1
"Hamburg to Accra via Lisbon. The business class is low economy class standard. My knees touched the next seat, not much option to recline the seat. There was no inflight entertainmaint and no socket to plug in a laptop. Food was okay, the rest was worse than what you get on most economy flights.",0
"We were 3 hours late departing Edinburgh so missed our connecting flight from Amsterdam to Toronto. We were forced to take a flight to JFK New York and then another flight from there to Toronto. Although it was very inconvenient and tiring, I realize that sometimes things happen that you cannot control. I contacted the customer service people when we returned and they were extremely helpful and compensated us for the flight. I would fly with KLM again!",1
"Copa Airlines has terrible customer service. My wife had surgery and needed wheelchair assistance. The airline refused to provide her wheelchair assistance in Brazil and forced her to carry her own bag despite providing the ticket agent with written doctor's orders explaining the need for assistance. While my wife was in the air, I called Copa Customer Service and they promised they would provide her assistance in Panama City and in Los Angeles. Of course, they did not. ",0
I have been flying Spirit to Myrtle Beach since 2005 and have been happy yes there are delays sometimes however I like sitting on the ground instead of going in circles in the air. I agree on the weight of luggage why only 40 lbs and not 50. as far as the staff and service no problem. Going to MYR in 3 weeks I'll see if there are any changes to the bad.,1
"Flight cancelled for no reason. Was told by several people on Southwest flight to Syracuse that Breeze would cancel for no reason and then, yes, my flight was cancelled. Could not reach a customer service rep. Could not reschedule through Breeze. So had to extend time is Syracuse an extra day to find flight.",0
"Flew on PG964 from Singapore to Koh Samui on 02 Oct. Even though flight was delayed for 30mins due to late arrival of the aircraft, we arrived Samui on time. Seat was comfortable and legroom was adequate. The staff were friendly and helpful. However, the ticket was expensive. but its reasonable because Samui airport belongs to the airline. Overall, I enjoyed this flight.",1
"Volotea always offers the best prices. I had to fly during the covid pandemic, and they had perfectly adapted to the situation. The flight is never late. Moreover we often land with 20 mn before the due hour of arrival, which is great.",1
Bangkok Don Meuang to Phuket. I have flown budget airlines in Europe and all i can describe is you get what you pay for and the airlines try to make more money from you selling you food drink and duty free at inflated prices. So what a refreshing change to be welcomed aboard and helped to my seat by friendly staff. Legroom was adequate and the aircraft was in excellent clean condition. Ten minutes into the flight the cabin crew handed out a small snack and a drink to everyone unheard of in Europe. Then there was a drinks trolley run which was reasonably priced for coffee and soft drinks. Then they came round with Nok Air merchandise but there was no high pressure sales patter going on it was all very relaxed. The captain kept us informed of progress in Thai and English. We will be flying with Nok Air again for sure could not fault it at all well done!!!!!!,1
"I recently booked a travel from Chennai to Kochi and paid about three times the fare as excess luggage fees. But due to an emergency 3 hours prior to the departure time, I had to cancel my trip. I called the customer service and explained my situation. They didn't even offer me partial credit for a later flight. I ended up buying another ticket, at full price, including the luggage fees, for the following week.  I would strongly recommend avoiding AirAsia at any cost!",0
Disgraceful behaviour from a boarding staff agent. Picked on me and my teenage daughter on our high quality Adidas face masks. Then our bags. Then would not give me his name or allow take our prepaid hold bags. Plane half empty lots of space.,0
"Our return flight was delayed from 10pm departure to a 2.30pm departure. We were finished boarding the flight at 11pm only to be told that we needed to take ourselves and our belongings back off the flight because it was having mechanical issues and needed to be serviced. They could not give us a time on how long that would take. At 2.30am we were called to board the flight once again. 1 hour after boarding the Pilot apologizes for the delay and mentions that it was because some of the flight crew needed to be relieved of duty. However, all of the original flight crew members including the Pilot were still there when we boarded for the second time. While waiting 4.5 hours in our terminal all other flights with Spirit were also delayed for about the same amount of time. ",0
"I booked my flight from Toronto to Winnipeg for August 16, 2021. I reached at check in line at about 19.15 and i told one of the lady employee standing there that i have a flight at 20.30 and she told me to wait in line that you still have a time. When i reached to the counter it was about 19.50 and the lady denied me to board the flight saying that I am late for check in.  Even when i asked what i can do now as i know nobody in Toronto she said she cant do anything in it and she just gave me option that i have to get another ticket from her different day flight. So i asked her option and she gave me two option one on 18th from Toronto to Winnipeg via Calgary and other one on 19th from Toronto to direct Winnipeg. She just print of the ticket without waiting for my answer and said that this is the ticket for you and you can call in customer care to cancel or rebook. I tried calling customer care late at night waited for about 3 hours but no answer and suddenly my call gets cut automatically.",0
"Calgary to Victoria. It was my father's first time flying! Everyone was super helpful, friendly, and caring. My dad was a little scared, but everyone on our flight was delightful. One of the male stewards went to the cockpit and talked to the pilot who said my dad if he wanted could go up to the cockpit. At first my dad was going to say no because we were on a time limit but he insisted. I even got a picture while one the other staff held my almost 4 month old. We love WestJet! Thanks for a great experience.",1
Transferring via Manila is to be avoided. Cebu staff will confiscate your passport and keep for hours. Nowhere are things handled this unprofessional and without clear information. Avoid Cebu Pacific and avoid transferring via Manila.,0
"When American Airlines changed flight numbers, they totally screwed up our ability to check in online. We have called them many many times, all four of us each. The customer service is the worst I have ever seen. When they call back, they have not worked with us, they even pretended like they could not hear us. This company is disgraceful and their SVP of customer service needs to be fired immediately. I would never recommend this airline to anybody.",0
LAX to ORD via St. Louis one way in first. Both flights on time. Food was very good. Staff was very professional. All in all a very nice experience. Not much entertainment wise but these flights are not that long.,1
"Punta Cana to Zurich via Cologne. Worst flight ever. They do not provide entertainment unless you pay for it. But even worse they only speak German assuming you understand it. It gets even trickier if someone in the aircraft seeking for a doctor help, but you do not understand what is going on, and then the announcement ""dear passenger we need a doctor"" is only done in German. I was also seated in front of annoying people that were adamant of not letting me pull down my seat to sleep during the 9 hours flight. I thought this was one of each passengers' prerogatives when buying a tickets. Especially in a 9 hour flight! They brought us to the wrong gate. They let us wait ages because there where not enough buses on the floor serving the flight.",0
"Second time flying with United that the flight is delayed because of a light bulb, making me miss my layover flights. They are never able to perform maintenance in a timely manner.",0
"WestJet made changes to my itinerary that does not work for me at all. This was not my doing and I would like a full refund on my credit card, however WestJet only offers travel rewards. I do not want to fly with this company at all especially since the customer service is very poor. I have now already spent 8 hours on the phone, 4 hours online and no human contact to resolve this issue. I advise all potential travelers to consider other airlines rather than WestJet.",0
Just did return flights on Scoot from Gold coast to Singapore and it's value for money. No complaint from me and my family. Recommend to anyone looking for value for money.,1
"Tucuman to Buenos Aires. This airline is a mess. Our flight was delayed for 10 hours without notification, we were dropped at the wrong airport, and missed our hotel reservation and were forced to sleep in the airport. No accommodations were made by the airline and we were just notified that our flight back is changed again. This is unacceptable. This airline has caused people to miss reservations, wait long hours, and nothing changes.",0
"Toronto to Phoenix. Well the plane is quite clean but the seats are small, so small. Why didn't I know about this? I've only been sitting in it for 1 hour and I'm so uncomfortable. We haven't even taken off yet. Oh for a drink to take the edge off but we haven't even left yet because staff loading the luggage can't shut the doors. Oh for some entertainment to distract me from this torture but no there is nothing. Seriously I'm so disappointed with myself for being on this flight. I've done budget airlines before easyJet, Ryanair. Maybe I'm too old now but this is just miserable. I've always been a big supporter of Air Canada, I had no idea this service was so vastly inferior. Boo AC. And never ever again. Except my return journey of course.",0
I want to thank Vinay from United Airlines in Newark for helping my coworkers and I. He was very patient and helpful in helping us with our needs as we had many baggage. Thank you so much. Five stars Vinay!,1
"Los Angeles to Shanghai. The worst airline ever, the customer service is very, very bad, they cancel flights as they like, and often they sell your seat in the plane to someone else and they tell you that you are late for the flight and the plane is then at the airport, the worst thing I've ever met was Shanghai Airport. Neither respect the mother nor the child. They keep us in China for five days with my twin children without apologizing.",0
"Amritsar to Delhi. My bag was tampered with and the security lock was removed after I checked in the baggage at Amritsar Airport and I received it with a broken security lock at Delhi airport. Valuable items are missing from my check in baggage. Poor response from Vistara Customer Care, despite repeated mails and calls.",0
"Flew Loganair from Barra to Glasgow. Very nice airline with a great customer service. Our flight for the next day should be canceled because of a storm, so we got booked to a flight one day before to get our onward international flight for sure. Aircraft was small but okay and the pilots did a great job to keep it silent.",1
Medications taken from checked bag had no letter for TSA. and if they did take they would have asked me when I landed. This took me some time to make sure I did not mail to myself with other things. I made sure I did not make a mistake. So this was over the 24hr. Required to call police and file. So end the end I am out 3500 in medicine. This is quite upsetting. Do not fly with this Airline.,0
"Boston to Detroit. Very disappointed with this airline. They have such bad baggage service, the locks and zippers on my bags were broken off, and I received my suitcase completely broken open with my clothes spilling out of the suitcase when I received it. Would not recommend as both flights I had received broken luggage.",0
Flew from Hong Kong to Paris via Seoul return in June. Great seat pitch. If you like Korean cuisine you will love the bimbimbap. Inflight entertainment is sufficient with large individual screens. What distinguishes Korean Air from other airlines is its cabin crew. All crews are very friendly attentive with above average English. Definitely recommend!,1
Absolute worst. Tried to upgrade seat and told that the ticket we bought was non refundable and not available to upgrade at any cost. This is the absolute worst policy ever. I was willing to spend good money to upgrade at the gate and was told we couldn't. This information was also never presented or buried so deep in the fine print that no one reads. I will never fly Delta again.,0
"Shanghai to Hong Kong. Flight left Shanghai late, although that seems quite normal. Crew smart with their uniforms and lots of smiles. Can't remember the last time a member of the crew, without even asking, placed my wife's luggage in the overhead bin. The meal on the short flight to Hong Kong was excellent and wine offered twice. All announcements clear and safety was top priority. No hesitation to fly with them again.",1
"Terrible information flow, had to check flightracker to know that my flight was rerouted. Food was bad and drinks were only handed out twice during the flight.  Absolutely terrible.",0
"Worst service for a handicap person. I was left to be last seated, no assistance to my gate, no assistance ready at my gate and rude TSA, no help. Worst experience ever.",0
Had a great flight to Seoul and then a transfer onto Auckland. Cannot fault them return journey was just as good and excellent. One thing however is that food onboard is not that good.,1
"Bristol to Krakow. Very unhappy with service. Arrived at gate 2 minutes after closing, attendant had just closed door behind last person. Refused to to get us on board or contact anybody on plane. Understand that was also our mistake but shocked from lack of human approach.",0
"This is the worst airline I have used. I flew from Singapore to Melbourne on Dec 3. I checked one bag in. When I got to Melbourne my bag was not on the plane. I went to the Scoot baggage desk to let them know, the women behind the desk never turned on a computer to see where it was, she just wrote my email address down on a piece of paper and said the baggage should be on the next flight the next day and that they would call. Nobody called so we call them and her answer was ""its not on the flight today I will have someone call you again nobody did. this same scenario has been repeated every day for a week now. When we try to call back, it is the same thing every day we get a recording stating that there is no one there please leave a message and still no one calls back. Even though they state they are open until midnight. I have sent many emails some have been answered some have not. they all say the some thing ""we are trying to track your luggage but have no record of it"" even after I have given them the tag information. I cannot understand how my bag has disappeared into thin air. Unfortunately scoot could not care less. I was in Australia for a wedding and had to buy all new clothes.",0
Flew from MAA to PNQ on 4th October. Check went on smooth. The flight was on time. The sandwich served onboard was excellent. Very clean and new aircraft. The flight arrived ahead of scheduled time. Overall wonderful experience. I would definitely fly with them again.,1
"Mumbai to London with Jet Airways was the most awful experience I have had on an airline. The cabin crew disappear after giving you your meal. When you call them they come to you with a 'false smile'. The wine was awful. The plane was unclean and extremely noisy. I had booked a specific meal after struggling to log onto the website. Was not served the meal ordered. The trays were not cleared for an hour after we finished, longer for the kids as they were served an hour before us! The entertainment on board was basic to say the least. We felt like unwelcome guests! They have no idea of customer service.",0
Tigerair flight from Bangalore to Singapore delayed by 3 hours through midnight and the airline manager sheepishly mentioned that a few passengers did get the notification when it was obvious that the airline made no attempt to communicate the delay. The intention was not to make the travel at all convenient for its passengers.,0
"Perth to Albany. This is the worst regional airline I have ever had to fly. They are always late with very poor communication. Fortunately for them, there is no competition in the routes they fly. Otherwise they would not have a business. They should be ashamed of the poor service they provide.",0
"Flight from Philly to Raleigh with connection to Orlando was delayed for over an hour, then passengers who had the connecting flight to Orlando had to get off the plane to seek other options. I was offered a direct flight from Philadelphia to Orlando the next morning at 5.49am, which was 17 hours away. After waiting 3 hours to get my luggage back, I inquired about a room for the night, and was advised by a Customer Service rep over the phone that a Ticketing Manager would accommodate, but when I approached the Manager, I was advised that I was given false information. I spent the 17 hours at the airport. I was able to check in for my new flight at about 1 am. Frontier did nothing to help any of the customers who were stranded at the airport for extended periods of time.",0
"I arrived at the airport, got through TSA to look at the boards and find out my flight had been canceled. I was not notified via email or text or call though I gave Delta all my information and permission to contact me. I had received email confirmation of my flight and texted my boarding pass. I was never notified that my flight was canceled. The lady at the counter was useless. Told me she could rebook me on a flight I said okay and then she said sorry it looks like it was taken there are no other options for you. For a refund you need to call customer service or contact them online. I go online and start chatting with an agent. Agent says there's nothing she can do. At this time I call Delta and wait on hold. I have to get in contact with a third and fourth person to get on a flight that works for me, no compensation or sorry or refund. Get better reps. Get better service. Any person that gets their flight canceled day of should get some sort of voucher or compensation. I can't believe that I had to go through this",0
"Bergamo to Tirana. As with other users I was the victim of what is basically an extortion scam. The website at the time I booked had no place to enter middle names. But they will not let you fly without them and then charge you 80 euros to change them. The website has been fixed, but who knows what other scam this airline is dreaming up.",0
"We recently flew business class New Delhi to Paro and Paro to Bangkok with Druk Air. They are a fantastic little airline being only one of two airlines serving Bhutan. We were on a trip via Delhi to Paro for 4 nights and then onto Bangkok. Both flights on time, lounges were shared and and of a good standard. Both flights considering Paro being one of the worlds most difficult airports to land in were flawless by the flight deck.. some amazing views en route and pointed out by the crew. Food and beverage were of a high standard and plentiful for 2 hour flights combined with excellent service from very professional and and delightful Bhutanese crew. Would certainly use again. Only point out being there is no Entertainment or wifi but the views en route you dont need it !",1
"Staff could be nicer to customers instead of yelling. There are some people who do not fly often and are not familiar with the rules, so be considerate of that and tell them what they are doing wrong instead of being rude.",0
Los Angeles to Dallas Ft Worth. This is possibly the worst airline we have ever flown. The plane itself is very nice but the customer service is awful. The people are rude and disrespectful. These people look like they hate their job and after talking to them you will leave with a bitter taste in your mouth.,0
"We booked our trip in advance, but TAP kept changing the flights, first they changed the way there flight to a different day, then 2 weeks later they changed the returned flight, then again they changed the return flight again. Completely crazy, no one answers the telephone and they take very long to reply to emails.",0
We went to Las Vegas on April 6th and it was not a good experience. The plane was small and the seats was very uncomfortable. On the way back our flight was delayed 3 times and they even charge for water bottles. I will stick with American airlines from here on out.,0
St Petersburg to Rome recently. Modern A320 with comfortable seating and good leg room. Cabin staff friendly courteous and efficient with limited English language skills. Overall very impressed ands would repeat the experience.,1
I flew to Antalya and back with Freebird in March 2014. Having read bad reviews I was expecting the worst. However I was very pleasantly surprised. The legroom was adequate for all except exceptionally tall people. Drinks and a very edible cheese and tomato roll were provided for no additional payment. We were kept well informed of our progress throughout the flight and the cabin staff spoke good English and could not have been more pleasant or helpful. Altogether it was a more pleasant experience than I have experienced with some better known airlines. I would certainly fly with Freebird again.,1
Just returned from Malaga with easyjet unfortunately due to a French air traffic control strike we were delayed however our captain kept us all informed and regularly updated on our flight situation. The crew were exceptional and nothing was a problem.. After boarding we were all given water and then anyone who wanted was given a complimentary drink.,1
"The customer service was horrible and not helpful with anything we had questions on. After our flight was delayed twice and we sat at the gate while other flights were boarded through this gate, we saw a man running up to the counter at the gate and out of breath. He proceeded to tell the women at the counter that he had boarded the plane. ",0
"Madrid to London. Fairly chaotic check in, largely down to the Iberia staff. Boarding was quick and friendly welcome from cabin crew. Seats are cramped and on a par with low cost standards, cabin was reasonably clean. Flight crew gave good information. Inflight the crew started the new food and drink sales, and this was where the chaos started. The time they were taking for each row they served was excruciating. I was seated 9 rows back and gave up waiting for a drink and dozed off. Before landing I spoke to my neighbour and asked if they finally got served ... they said the sandwiches had all run out long before staff got them. This was not a cheap fare that I got, and British Airways state publicly that their customers asked for this new service, buy onboard etc. What a lie, I have yet to meet anyone who has been asked what they wanted in the many months before BA stopped any complimentary service. Sad to see our national airline has slipped well below the likes of Lufthansa and Air France.",0
I flew with Air Serbia in June from Abu Dhabi to Belgrade and from Sarajevo to Belgrade. Nice young friendly cabin crew excellent catering and flying with Serbian people you don't need better entertainment. Both flights were on time with wonderful landing from Sarajevo to Belgrade turning around Avala mountain.,1
"The customer service on these flights is absolutely horrendous. The flight attendants are rude and callous and do not care for the customer at all. I was walking down the single person aisle and a flight attendant had the nerve to try and push her way through me, when I said excuse you she just scoffed and pushed herself through the rest of her way. Other flight attendants will knock into you, bump you, step on your feet and not even give so much as an apology. American Airlines you need to fix this ASAP. If your workers do not want to serve customers they need to see themselves in a different profession because this type of behavior is absolutely unacceptable.",0
"American has to be one of the worst airlines I have flown, Frontier is probably the only one that is worse, but at least they are transparent about their limitations. They have shown literally no efforts to social distance or keep people separated on their flights. On the same trip I flew Alaskan which made sure that people flying were only sitting in aisle and window seats and that parties were close to each other. Not only did American change my seat about twelve times, they separated my party and had a completely packed plane. Very disappointed American. Will not be flying with this airline again.",0
"Boarding while there is a power problem. So plane were no lights. Startup again power then no aircon! Delayed already, then excuse and safety demo. Then again captain still problems and sitting already one hour no aircon and just have to wait when or if they fixed it Serving warm water and while no aircon and still waiting to leave 22.00 hour. Last time SA for us.",0
"They are not ready to fly internationally. Please avoid this terrible airline. No real professionalism in its staff and not even water is offered during the flight. The seats, are most uncomfortable. I will not recommend this airline to anybody.",0
"The Red Eye from Perth to Sydney on Qantas is one of the worst experiences you can imagine unless you travel with Qantas offshoot Jetstar. The seats are so narrow that even a moderate height person will have trouble getting comfortable. The cabin service, such as it that there was, was budget style at best. I found the food particularly distasteful and ordering a drink was like being treat like a pariah. Only a lack of alternative flights compelled me to fly with the company. I last flew with them about two years ago and my misgivings from that experience continue to be confirmed.",0
We were 11 people coming in with a short connection to Zurich hoping to continue with Adria to Ljubjana. We were before final call at the departure gate. Other people were still boarding. Adria had decided to rebook us and could not put us back on the plane. I and my wife had no checked in baggage. We had to wait 5 hours for next flight. This was extremely bad service and will do our utmost to never have to fly Adria again. We will also warn all our flying friends.,0
"This was my first time flying with United in many years and it will be my last. I paid for 1st class and yet they allowed frequent flyers to board before 1st Class passengers causing a long line to get on the plane. I usually fly on Delta or American and they always call 1st class passengers after elderly and Veterans. I also don't like that they don't have screens on the seats in front of us, and there was no place to comfortably put my tablet to watch entertainment on. The other airlines either have screens on the seats in front or they have something that drops down from the seat to easily put our device on to watch entertainment. This plane didn't have USB to plug into for charging. I fly a lot and I haven't been on a plane recently that doesn't have USB. They just have the regular outlets and they were very difficult to get to. I had to get on my knees in the aisle and bend over with a light just to see the plug so that I could plug in the power for my device. I went to the Orlando, FL United club I've been in many airline clubs and I've never been to one so bad. It was small, over crowded, and very little food selections. It was very disappointing. For all of these reasons, I will not be flying on United again.",0
Admittedly there was a storm two days before we wanted to arrive in our destination of Indianapolis. They repeatedly lied to us and told us that the Indianapolis airport was closed when there were other airlines flying into Indianapolis from the same airport. They changed our flight 10 times. After they cancelled our flight to Indy they put us on another flight to Louisville airport after we received this confirmation the flight was reinstated but we lost our spot. They never gave us meal vouchers or paid for a hotel. They refused to get us a ticket with any other airline actually flying into Indianapolis too. All in all the worst experience I have eve had with any company.,0
Flying from Manchester to Calgary to see family so was very excited but the beginning of the holiday was very stressful due to numerous events relating to the flight. Due to depart at 12 but still hadn't boarded by then. When all seated and ready to go we were told there was a problem and we would be updated every 15 mins but after 4 hours we were told that the problem would not be sorted until the next day so we were put up in a hotel for the night. We finally took off 24 hours later. On our return journey on the 22 May all went well except for the very unprofessional manner of on of the cabin crew who after giving us black tea and coffee told us she wasn't a mind reader and if we had wanted milk we should have asked for it. I would have thought that this would have been common courtesy and also a very important part of a public related job. Would rather pay a higher price than use this airline again.,0
"Paris to Venice . Air France didn't deliver my suitcase on time when I arrived in Italy. Nobody was able to tell me if it was a simple delay or where the suitcase was. Afterwards I discover through a colleague working at the airport in Paris that my suitcase was still in Paris. It was the first time I used the self checking at the airport, nobody was there to help me. I finally got my suitcase 3 days later.  When I got back from my vacation 3 weeks later I sent to Air France receipts to get the money back. They said I was too late. Air France offer a very bad customer service.",0
"I flew United Airlines UA2251 from New York to Mexico City on 27July 2021 I was told there would be no food service on board but would be able to purchase food and drink, that was not the case. I was told that unfortunately they were unable to load the food and drink on the aircraft in New York. I accepted that and completed the journey, on our way back from Mexico city with flight UA2252 we encountered the same problem. We were however offered soda, water, pretzels and biscuits on both flights for free. On top of that they offered in flight entertainment on the return flight only, with no headphones, again I would have had no problem in purchasing head phones from United Airlines. I felt that for an airline as big as United Airlines they could have made food available for purchase to the passengers. I for one would not have an issue with purchasing a sandwich and a beer at an extra charge. How difficult could that have been for United Airlines? What has happened to the upsell? I have been on airlines in Zimbabwe where they offer food for purchase on board flights and am shocked and disappointed that a third world country could offer a better flight experience than United Airlines. Come on guys get it together, I probably won't fly with United ever again because of this.",0
"Denver to Fort Myers via Dallas. I strongly regret flying with American Airlines who perform poorly in every aspect. Worst of all, their employees do not care one bit.  I regret that I did not see all the negative reviews before booking. I know that I will never fly with this miserable company again.",0
"My brother flew from Toronto to Manila on June 10 and his luggage never made it. Spoke to PAL in Philippines and they were trying to blame him. Saying he checked in late. This isn't our first time going to Philippines. We know to be at the airport 3 hrs before our flight. We actually finished checking in by 830 PM when the flight wasn't leaving until 1130. So after more than 16 hrs of flight and 12 hrs of no word, PAL says it was left in Toronto. Why make my brother wait over an hour waiting for luggage that never showed? Why did it take another 12hrs for someone to know it was left in Toronto?",0
"Sydney to Brisbane. I don't know why I keep flying this terrible airline. This is the second time they have cancelled a flight on me. I was book to travel on 3 July from Sydney to Brisbane. I was in Canberra and had to drive to sydney to catch my flight. I received a text from the airline to say that my flight was cancelled due to technical problems with the aircraft. The call centre told me that i had two options, a flight to Sydney on the 5th, or a flight to the Gold Coast on the day. Picked the latter because i did not want to pay accomodation charges in Australia's most expensive city. I mentioned to a member of Tigerair staff at the kiosk at Sydney airport that I had been bumped off the flight. Her reply ""why do you keep flying on this airline"". Hardly filled me with confidence. It took me two hours by public transport to get to Brisbane Domestic airport to pick up my car. Dreadful, never again.",0
"Very good service service, sandy Cornish was outstanding. Meals we had selected were not available, she went all the way to see that we got our selected meals. We appreciate such dedicated staff in Air New Zealand.",1
"Mexico City to Cancun. Avoid at all costs, we were triple charged at the airport for the flight, they said our payment was not processed even though we showed them the funds had been transferred. They said we had to pay them cash now at the counter to get our boarding passes printed. We had no option as our trip was organised for the next day. Avoid at all costs, scammers.",0
"Doha to Muscat return. I would like to express my the best travel experience which I had two days before.  Wonderful experience. The flight quite amazing, Seat space and all experience are amazing. Thanks, Qatar Airways for providing the best travel experience.",1
"Houston to Belize. Absolutely the worst customer service I've ever seen. If you can avoid this airline please do at all costs. The people working in the kiosk check in areas are the most rude, unhelpful people on this planet of ours. I don't know where United finds these staff, but they are the most incompetent I have ever dealt with. I fly very often for business and I must say of all the airlines I deal with United is, without a doubt, the absolute worst.",0
Afraid I have to join the majority here. I had booked the 21.30 flight from Kalibo to Manila on 6 July 2013 with Zest. A day in advance I got an SMS and email that this flight was cancelled and we were moved to their 23.50 flight. It is almost that time now and we were informed the flight will come in around 2 am arriving in Manila at 4am. Instead of an easy night in Manila with planned arrival 11.30 pm I now foresee a night deprived of sleep. With hindsight I should have paid 8 Euros more for Air Philippines that departed nicely on time.,0
Varanasi to Goa via Hyderabad. They have worst cabin crew I've ever seen. Very aggressive and disrespecting. They have no manners to talk to someone. The air hostess was shouting at people for no apparent reason.,0
"Dallas Fort Worth to La Guardia, and Spirit Airlines didn't let us know that the flight was cancelled until we arrived at the airport. They didn't want to help to find another flight but just said to come back next day for a flight. Too much tax charge on baggage. The worst airline experience ever. I will never recommend this airline to anyone.",0
Charlotte to Orlando. My flight was to leave at 1030am in it got delayed over time I stop counting. I didn't get leave the first airport until 6pm at night my seat was taken that i paid for in was told i would have to buy a upgrade if to get it back. The staff was very rude when talking to them especially on the second part of the flight in North Carolina. I didn't get to my destination until almost 11pm at night was place in middle seat after my aisle was taken from me in was told I would have to pay a extra 50 dollars when there was lots of empty seat on the flight. This was the worst experience I have ever been on. I will never use this airline again they have drop off service,0
"Fabulous flight with KLM flying from Newcastle to Mexico via Amsterdam. Seat very comfortable, lots of space. Excellent food, pumpkin soup was nicest soup I've tasted in ages, great service. Gift at the end of flight was a nice touch. Crown Lounge in Amsterdam is good. Highly recommended. Looking forward to my flight in June already.",1
"Two weeks after booking my flight, TAP Portugal sent me an email saying they cancelled it and moved me on the same flight the day before instead. The problem is that it was a connecting flight and I couldn't take my other flights anymore. I tried to contact them by phone, Skype, email, Facebook and Twitter. Basically every option they offer but they never replied to anything. Useless customer service.",0
One of the worst airlines I've ever tried to fly with. And will be the last time. It's would almost be faster to walk to Toronto from Winnipeg .the delays are unreal. If you can't support your customers. Pull out of the game and let WestJet or Swoop take over your lanes.,0
"I booked a flight with them on 26 of March, but was unable to flight to the destination due to coronavirus restrictions. Since then I am trying to call them every day! I also filled out the form to request a refund but no reply in a week. Today I finally managed to spoke to the lady on the phone from their CS, but she just directed me to their website or she gave me another number. This number directed me to call again the first number I called already! After minutes of waiting again I spoke to another lady, she asked me for my reference and said she will transfer me to someone else, when she hang up on me!! Unbelievable!! So you can not even call them, and when you finally speak with someone no help at all! I never thought company like this have this poor customer service especially in situation like this with the corona virus.",0
Cloncurry to Auckland via Brisbane. My memory of Virgin Australia being an average airline is far from true. Both planes were immaculate and flights on time. Cabin crew professional and courteous. IFE was receptive and wifi worked well. Meal is slightly above flight standards.,1
Istanbul to Tel Aviv return. Ground staff very helpful in boarding the flight. Both flights left and arrived on time. The planes were clean and modern and the flights uneventful. The seats were comfortable and with adequate leg room and recline. Food was reasonable and the portions were satisfactory. Cabin staff were efficient and the meal was served early on both flights. On the return flight the check in worked well. I was given priority because I was transferring to Business Class for the second leg. Overall I was happy with the standard of service and the flights.,1
Taking a flight with United is worse than riding a bus. At least with a bus you can get off and walk or talk to the driver so you know what is going on. Shortly after booking our flight our layover was extended 4 hours with no option to reject this or get a refund. Now I am sitting her and layover continues to be extended with no communication. This is by far the worst airline. They used to set the standard and now their standards are nowhere to be found.,0
Abbotsford to Edmonton. Worst airline ever. They delay the flight more than 3 hours and offer no meal vouchers or answers. Staff is rude and lacks all knowledge and care to do their job even a little bit.,0
Terrible airline with non existent customer service. Flew Barcelona to London a week ago and they lost my luggage. I have tried calling and emailing but no one seems interested in finding it. They just tell me it cannot be traced and haven't even apologised.,0
Fly from GSP to SFB frequently. If you like riding a bus this is the airline for you. Cheap yes. In every way. Their fares look great until you start adding up all the extra charges. Never on time and if you have baggage pack a meal while you wait for it! Most uncomfortable seating ever. I guess if you only fly once a year it's OK to be inconvenienced but if you need to be somewhere on time look elsewhere!,0
"Dublin to Tokyo via Dubai. I secured a real bargain rate for a first class ticket. I did not see any evidence of cost cutting throughout the experience. Standards were high and the crews encountered displayed a high level of motivation. We still have the Boeing 777 as the only option from Dublin but they were all in superb condition. Plenty of complementary goodies for the ladies and as much food and drink you fancied at the click of the galley button. The Dubai stopovers were well organised and a really good room at Le Meridien was provided, along with copious food and beverage vouchers. The Timeless spa concession at the 1st class lounge I found to be a white elephant, unable to get an appointment and they did not mention this is only available at the main concourse B, after the long walk to concourse C. The only downside was not Emirates fault. A long reroute from Tokyo because of the tensions in the area and 11 hrs of heavy turbulance with the crew struggling even with the basics.  All in all couldn't fault them given the culture of cut everything to the bone by some airlines at the moment.",1
"Flight from Fort Myers to Chicago first delayed was over an hour due to AC not working then boarded plane to only find out. engine failed to start after sitting on the plane for another hour. Then we were told to get off plane, we were not told anything on when we would be leaving. Spirit just wanted us off the plane. Be Aware Spirit airlines does not take care of stranded customers.",0
"Colombo to Kathmandu via Kuala Lumpur. Our flight was 4 hours late, so we miss our transfer at Kuala Lumpur. The company never apologize, they lied to us, they said they inform Kuala Lumpur airport and promise the plane will wait but nobody never called.",0
Has your flight been cancelled by Aeroflot themselves? Forget about your money back. You will never see them. I'm waiting for a refund for last 2.5 years!,0
Absolutely awful service. Refusing to change booking without paying again the same amount or higher price. Refusing to refund tickets. Charges for pets in cabin are double the price of my ticket. Website says any changes are free but they don't care and still charges exuberant amounts. Disgraceful company.,0
Manchester to Alicante. First time I have ever flown with Norwegian and all I can say best airline I've ever flown with. Staff very pleasant food good and best of all wifi makes a massive difference when travelling alone. I will definitely be looking at this airline to be my first choice to fly with in the future. Excellent.,1
"Spirit Airlines is an awful airline to fly. First our Denver to Detroit flight was delayed and then cancelled. The customer service could not tell us why. Also, they would not schedule on the next flight available or pay for us to be on another airline. Instead, we waited another day to try and make the next late night flight. They do nothing to try and help their customers out.",0
Travelled from Sydney to Perth return on business class. Very impressive service over the continent. Offered juice or water prior to take off. Had a choice of 3 entrees 3 mains and 2 desserts on each leg both legs were a lunch service. Food was great as was the choice of beers wines and desert wines. Seat was comfortable enough for the flight and I was provided with a pillow and a blanket. IFE was of international standard with plenty of options. Highly recommended east to west service.,1
"Due to fly Des Moines to Charlotte. Over 5 months I have flown American Airlines 9 times. Every flight was delayed due to ""mechanical issues"". 4 of those flights had no working restroom. I own several older vehicles that run better than AA planes! My confidence in this airline is so low I am seeking other airlines and paying more to get on planes that work. This cannot be coincidence that only the planes I am flying are like this. As I write this, my flight is delayed. Mechanical issues. Cannot wait to get in the air so we can test AA's equipment with several dozen lives on board.",0
"This airline has no respect to their customers, delayed my flight for over 4 hours, then cancel it, without any vouchers etc, had to stay at a hotel for an extra day in Toronto with no help from them. They put me on a flight for 4 the next day only to have this flight delayed for another 3 hours. Air Canada are not taking your calls, I am stuck in Canada with no help from them.",0
"Guangzhou to Los Angeles. Travelling with my wife Furnari from Sydney to LA, but we chose to transfer in Hong Kong, stayed for one day, and then caught our long flight to LA in Guangzhou. I found it was the best way to get tickets at the most reasonable price. We just landed in LA couple hours ago, and I just want to show my appreciation for all the crew members who helped us during the past 12 hours. At first, I found out my seat was broken and there was a huge empty part on my lower seatback. I asked a flight attendant to get me a big pillow to block it. He came out with a better solution by offering us three joint seats. That was very nice of him. Secondly, we forgot to apply for the special meals. We bought some vegan food before leaving Sydney, but we finished them all in Hong Kong. I told the crew I was wondering if they can gave us some vegan food, and she told me they had some extra vegan and vegetarian meals today, lucky us, we can have some. We are so grateful for their great kindness and professionality. Despite the shortage of the hardware, they really have amazing service skills. And also because of the reasonable ticket price, I would definitely choose them again. Recommended.",1
"Bogota to Los Angeles via Mexico City. Worst customer service experience in over 30 years of travel! Aeromexico employees in Mexico city are of the utmost unprofessional, ill informed employees I have encountered. From the moment our plane arrived we were misled, disregarded in regards to a connection to LA. We had a conversation to make and had to get our luggage to move forward. We were missing one piece of luggage. I Immediately I went to representatives, showed them my ticket and was told to just wait. This us where the ineptitude and arrogance began. Not only was I misdirected to 3 wrong areas but was just pointed in the general direction of where to go by supervisors of all people! Knowing that we were on the verge of missing a flight at NO fault of our own. I insisted that we be taken by someone Personally and this employee took me to the wrong area as well. NO ONE knows what is going on and above all RUDE about it. Aeromexico is not the airline you want to consider traveling with first and last time with this home of a company!",0
Flew DL from Milan to JFK after arriving on Etihad couldn't wait to see how DL matched up. I was impressed with the level of service from crew bantering with passengers smiling as they went about their duties so eager to serve. The IFE and meals were equally impressive far better than my preceding flight on Etihad flight. This is surely an improvement from the Delta I used to know perhaps the competition is bringing out a different side.,1
"My luggage was delayed for more than 2 weeks and Lufthansa handled it very badly. There was no communication at all from their side, getting someone on the phone took me 1h everyday and the person on the phone told me several time ""our system is not working now, try to call later"". 2 months later I still haven't received any compensation. Their customer service is stuck with a robot sending me emails asking for my address even if I already replied the same message 3 time.  If everything goes well you might have a good flight but as soon as their is any small problem they cannot handle it.",0
We upgraded to club class because of the extra legroom in the seats. We did not expect much as it was cheaper than Air Canada. We were in for a surprise! We flew from Toronto to Puerto Vallarta Mexico. As soon as we were seated we were offered a glass of wine. We had two cabin flight attendants for the business class. The flight attendants were very cheerful and helpful throughout the flight the food was the best we've had on any aircraft. Wrote the flight we were offered wine beer liquor the cure coffee tea anything that we wanted. The nicest part about it is there is a separate washroom for only the business class. We were hoping that the service and food would be as good on the way home. And it was. I would not hesitate to fly Air Transat again.,1
I am very disappointed with this airline! We purchased our tickets over a month ago just to get a notification that our flight has been canceled the day of departure. When we arrived at the airport at 2am to have no one give us a real explanation as to why this happened we lost a lot of time and money on our hotel and car rental. Fast forward to TSA we passed with our personal bag just to be charged an obscene amount of money for a personal bag.,0
Fort Lauderdale to Las Vegas. Dirty! The aircraft was extremely dirty this time. I flew Spirit many times. The attendants are very often rude and impatient. This time the aircraft was dirty. The seats by my side had something stuck on it.,0
"Salt Lake City to San Francisco. At the gate boarding the plane I was stopped and my personal item bags size was checked. My backpack has lots of straps so they would get caught. After tucking the straps in my bag fit just fine. However, my gate attendent told me it didn't fit and she would be charging me. I declined as I and the people around me all noted my bag fit in their predetermined slot size. She replied I would not be able to fly unless I paid and as I had no choice at the gate I had to pay, however her attitude was rude and condescending and it's safe to say that before I even stepped fit on the plane it was my worst airport experience ever. It is safe to say I will never fly United air again after this trip unless the 65 dollars she charged me at the gate is refunded. What a nightmare she was. United you should have a talk with this gate attendent who was absolutely terrible to deal with.",0
"Terrible airline, canceled our flight without a notice. At the airport the person didn't know what was going on. Never will use this airline again. Please be aware of bad airline, and bad service.",0
"Early morning flight from Lisbon to Zurich, on time from start to landing. I bought an economy ticket but when I got to the gate, I was informed that I am being treated with an upgrade to business class. Thank you very much, Swiss Air Lines. The flight from Zurich to Lisbon on the previous evening was in economy class. I love the CS300, it is brand new and state of the art, but the seats are not that comfortable. After two hours or so you start to feel uncomfortable. In the first row of business class, I felt good, but I could not spread my legs because of the bulkhead. As a matter of facts, that was better in economy. But everything else was perfect. Kudos to the crew and the food was perfect. Will consider Swiss Air Lines again.",1
Las Vegas to Salt Lake City. I bought mine and my son tickets together. I've never been separated from anyone I've flown with. He is 13 yrs old with severe anxiety issues. I'm told they have no seats to put us together and I've spent the last 30 mins trying to call him down. I don't care if he is old enough in your terms to fly alone. Mentally he is not! I have never been so unhappy with an airline. This is unacceptable in my book! I wouldn't recommend anyone flying with children that they consider old enough to fly on their own with any type of disability or concerns with their mental health to fly this airline!,0
"The  ground staff, flight, in flight entertainment, meal and seat is awesome. Flight Attendants welcomed us and helped to get us to our seats. I was given a noise cancelling headphones and a clean blanket. Food was just amazing. I got some time to have a word with Flight crews and they happily enjoyed to talk with me. The washroom was clean and nicely maintained.",1
"Flew Fort Lauderdale to San Francisco with United Airlines. My worst flight ever. Very old plane recline and old seat. No TV or entertainment system. Very poor breakfast, very bad service on board. Impossible to relax or work on board.",0
Luton to Heraklion. Well the flight and cabin crew are first class but the airline is let down by the ground handling agents it uses. Our flight out from Luton was boarded and pushed back from the stand and head down the taxi way towards the run way only to be met half way down by a follow me car from the airport and parked on a remote stand at Luton. This was after what I can describe has the worst aircraft marshalling I have seen since I watched a charity clip by the RAF on UTUBE. Luton Airport wonders why it is getting so many bad reviews and bad press. Why board an aircraft which you know is going to be subjected to a 30 minute delay. The aircraft captain told everyone that the was an ATC delay due to congestion en route but this would of been known before the aircraft was boarded so why board it? But when we did get underway the crew due to tail winds were able to make up the 30 minute delay and arrival on stand on time. The service on board was slick and professional. The menu was good value for money and we had pre ordered which is a new service and I can recommend this to any one. The return trip we left 35 minutes late due to the aircraft which was been used arriving late from its trip to Luton. However again the crew were able to make up 20 minutes of the flight time arriving into Luton 15 minutes late. But due to the non existent cowboy ground handling company and the jobs worth mentality of its staff who could only manage to be bothered to use one set of aircraft stairs for a full A320 which was parked on a remote stand meant we were kept waiting 35 minutes before we got into the terminal building.,1
"Mexico City to Merida. The smallest seats I have ever tried to sit in. I was hit twice by luggage of other passengers and once by the vendors of drinks and snacks, trying to navigate the narrow aisle. Impossible to stretch your legs under the seat in front of you nor stand up to get out of your seat. To evacuate or exit, the passenger in the window seat has to raise the armrests and slide himself to the aisle. They continuously changed the departure time and listed the aircraft as on time. Very confusing to the driver who was to pick us up. An hour after our so called ""on time "" flight arrival time, the driver left since the flight supposedly arrived on time and he couldn't find us.",0
"One of the staff members told me to put my backpack underneath the chair which I was complying to, but she then started to rush me and even went as far as kicking my backpack that had a laptop inside. She even had an angry look on her face because she seemed annoyed with me and then with the person in front of me, when she was correcting them about putting their bags under their seat she seemed much nicer to them. I am really upset by how she kicked my bag that had electronics inside and now my laptop is a little different than before. Unbelievable mannerisms from that flight attendant.",0
Flew Los Angeles to New York JFK with Delta Air Lines. Very poor service. I had to check in my only bag when everyone else had more then two. I also had to wait because the overhead compartment was broken which should of been taken care of before we got on the plane.,0
Larnaca to Tel Aviv. This is the second time I was to fly Aegean Airlines. This time I bought tickets to fly in August 2018 in high price for comfortable flying hours since I am flying with young children. I found out the company cancel our flight and listing us to the uncomfortable flight time with no compensation.  I will not fly Aegean Airlines again.,0
Guangzhou to Vancouver. Good service and safe flight. Staff are very professional. Thanks for all the staffs. Specially during this pandemic time. Will definitely choose the southern airlines again next time,1
"Aeroflot has a good planes and good pilots, but the service was pretty bad, the lines in Moscow airport are long and disorganised, in Miami they pushed me to paid an additional PCR for couple hours of my previous test. Flight attendants let people occupy 3 chairs and sleep but you can't sit in the economy seat In front of the toilet because they call it economy comfort. They keep the plane extremely hot, normal in Russia but extremely annoying for non russian. I will avoid it if I can.",0
"The cancelled my ticket less than 10 days before the actual flight and refused to offer the legal compensation. A disgrace. They claimed they have sent the cancellation earlier and as a proof they showed a comment from their system mentioning a hoax address, very different from the one I used for my booking.",0
I have been on many business class trips all lovely but Singapore Airlines tops them all. Their cabin crew are friendly and always smiling the meals were excellent the seat was huge and IFE was excellent. The lounge in Singapore was the best I have been in. For the 25 hours it took to get from Sydney to Paris I enjoyed every second what I liked the most was the express passes at Sydney International Airport skipping the queue at customs. I don't usually fly on business trips with the kids but they loved it too!,1
Toronto to Edmonton. Disappointed with the airline. Staff were very rude to my daughter who is carrying a nine month old. The agent at the counter was very rude to her and did not even help her put her stroller or car seat up to help her while she carried her baby and then when she got on the plane she had to ask for assistance by other passengers. The flight attendants would not help her whatsoever.,0
"Worst Airline I have ever dealt with!! Cancelled flight from Toronto to Cancun 2 hours before we are suppose to get on the plane and then when you try to rebook for the next morning they want more money. How do they get away with that! Isn't that called extortion? Flight date was March 4, flight time was 1435, delayed twice and then cancelled.",0
"Baltimore to Martinique, and Norwegian's affordable plane tickets were a godsend to my family. Thanks to the affordable prices my husband, daughter and I were able to surprise our parents for Christmas and New Years. We had not celebrated Christmas together as a family in 16 years!  Thanks to these affordable prices many Martiniquan Americans will be able to visit family in Martinique more often and as a family, instead of choosing who can travel because the prices are too high. The customer service given on the flights was impeccable. The refreshments were reasonably priced and appreciated. ",1
"My flight from PBI to RDU was delayed twice and was notified via emails, which was ok. Then the flight was cancelled. I found this out at the airport and was never sent an email or text. At the airport after waiting in a very long line for the one attendant, who told me she couldn't do rebooking, I would need to call customer service. I tried three times to reach customer service each time after being on hold for over 30 minutes I would be cut off! I never reached them and gave up! What a waste of time. And waste of money booking another flight at the last second!",0
"Due to the traffic on the way to the airport I was late. When I arrive I realize that I need to print out my covid test results in order to fly. I was in a hurry and was panicking. A ground staff saw me and asked if I needed any help. I told him that I am going to miss my flight to LAX if I don't have my covid test results. He then quickly led me to the airport's business center to get my results printed, and then help me get through customs to save even more time. I really appreciate the help that he have given me.",1
We flew from Washington DC to Doha then on to Perth. We had a wonderful flight. Staff were extremely professional and made the time in the air fly by would recommend Qatar Airways to anybody.,1
"The flight was delayed by 13 hours, and we received no support whatsoever. No hotel accommodation for the night, no food, nor beverage, nor voucher to use at the airport. All passengers were frustrated and we were constantly receiving intentionally deceiving information by the staff.",0
"They have lost my luggage. 31 days later I still have not received a reply. When I call the customer service phone, they directed me to other numbers, the agents on the phone were clueless on how to handle the situation. Finally, they have directed me to an email. Sometimes the email box is full so they are not even receiving any more emails. However, even when the mail is received they have not answered or responded to my questions. I have tried to contact them almost daily. I did not even get an update on the status of a refund for my lost bag. I had to pay a lot of money for clothes something I have not considered to do on this vacation.",0
"The worst airline me or my family has ever been on. Flights 3 times, seats switched without refund, gates switched without informing anyone. They don't help in any way when it's their fault and yes the snow storm on in Texas was no reason to not fly, the airport was fine.",0
"Dubai to Istambul. Never in my life I faced so rude staff from any place except when I was preparing the check in for my returning flight to Dubai. The lady at the check in was out of information, as a resident with a valid ID I can enter to UAE with out showing my resident stamp in my passport but she started calling Duty managers and everyone until they decided that I can not travel, so she said I need tourist visa, so ridiculous, being a UAE resident, I need a visa to enter. So I demand to talk with the manager cause all those smart agent were not aware of my privileges as resident. After arguing with that smart lady she got angry cause I put my phone over the desk, then, that ""worker"" transformed, she start shouting on me why I was taking a picture. She retaining my passport against my will.  After 15 minutes the DM came and she decided I can travel.",0
I would certainly fly them again. The Service was good the seats were roomy and the food delicious. I also liked that the flight length from Perth to Doha and then to Manchester was great. It was 10.5 hrs from here to Doha then 6.30 hrs from Dhoa to Manchester. Keep up the good work.,1
Bangkok to Singapore. We booked a flight to Singapore at 7pm for the same day at 11pm. We went for check in at 8pm to be told the flight was cancelled. The staff mentioned that it got cancelled the day before! Why did the website allow us to spend our money for nothing? They mentioned that it was not cancelled but delayed to the next day at 1pm. We tried to call the call centre multiple times with no answer.,0
"Flew Iberia from Madrid to New York JFK. Check in at Madrid airport was fast, no lines. Fast track for security and I was at the lounge 15 min after arriving at the airport. Lounge nice, breakfast buffet with lots of hot and cold choices. Boarding on time. Priority boarding line empty. FA's very nice on board. Window seat feels very private and comfy. Great IFE, but limited choices compared to other airlines. Good selction of movies. Great on board selection of wines and lunch. Got a good rest on an 8hr flight. Arrival in JFK T7, not my favorite terminal but fine. On a taxi 40 min after arrival to the city.",1
"Athens to Malaga via  Zurich. Plane seats are uncomfortable, inflight service limited to a small snack and the flight attendants are polite but unfriendly. The ground staff in Zurich are unprofessional and impolite. They created problems at departure gate for the hand luggage weight or size, but only for some passengers, some were allowed to enter with 2 or three pieces of luggage and some were challenged for having 10 kgs of luggage instead of 8!",0
"London Heathrow to Dubai. Last Sunday we unfortunately missed our BA flight to Dubai due to unforeseen circumstances, so we booked the next available flight for the morning which was with Emirates. Today we arrived at Dubai airport expecting to board the flight home that we had already paid for months in advance. At check in the BA staff told us that our flight had been cancelled as we missed our outgoing flight. We have not received a refund for the seats and they have refused to refund us the tickets we had brought.",0
"Staff on both flights were amazing and helpful, food was very impressive as well, would fly with Qatar again. Left on time and arrived as per the scheduling, flawless flight.",1
Totally disappointed by Etihad . Flight delayed 15 hours without notice no customer service baggage lost. I am trying to contact lost and found since 4 hours and I have not received a reply yet. Staff is not helpful and the Abu Dhabi airport did not have enough facilities to accommodate all the passengers. I do not suggest to fly with this company.,0
"I was pleasantly surprised by my trip with French Bee. I was on a different airline arriving to Newark but my flight got delayed. French Bee customer service answered the line within just a few minutes and were willing to rebook me without a fee only had to pay the difference if needed. I was able to make it to the desk just a few minutes before closing and the staff were very professional and friendly. Finally, the flight was good and the service on board was great. For the cost and after this experience, I will definitely fly with them again.",1
"Dubai to London Heathrow. Lovely flight and a great BA Worldwide Crew, which are the best in the BA fleet. Very good seat with great extras that you would expect in 1st Class. Chose to sleep as it was a night flight, but had a delicious full breakfast in the morning. Baggage allowance was superb with 3 x 32Kg cases and 2 cabin bags. Overall, a lovely flight, with a great airline, that has a great crew",1
"I traveled with my family, 3 of us. We could have easily sat in one row together. Yet, instead of keeping our family together to avoid contamination with others, we were all seated separately with others. On top of the fact there is absolutely no social distancing, we are being further exposed to the virus and its deadly consequences by sitting with strangers. This is an ongoing issue as I heard others in the aircraft complaining about the same thing. We travel American all the time and now we feel very unsafe. To me and my family this doesn't make sense, but to the airline, I'm assuming it makes plenty ""cents"" as we are being charged outrageous prices to choose to sit with our loved ones.",0
"I was supposed to fly with Spirit Airlines in the beginning of February, I had 4 flights booked within a 1 week period. My mother turned Ill and I needed to care for her. I tried mentioned this to the airline and gave them her hospice care paperwork. After receiving an email back requesting an abundance of documentation, dr notes and letter heads, I determined that Spirit Airlines was very insensitive to my mothers passing and that I would never fly Spirit again. I would recommend never flying with this company under any circumstance.",0
"My fight was 1193 from Baltimore to Fort Lauderdale on March 27, 2019. This was by far the best flight I've had with any airline. The flight staff was very courteous and humorous. They constantly made announcements keeping us informed of everything. Treated us like family and kept us laughing and entertained. The flight was smooth and on time.",1
"The worst service I have had, no one wants to help, they hire employees with no training off the hood. I was charged 2 times for my carry on, their price is cheap but they lie to you and at the gate they get you with fees. We are in seats like sardines. I would never fly with them again.",0
Milan to Madrid with Ryanair. I don't want to minimize the negative reviews on here from other passengers but everything with my flight went fine. I read through all of their rules and looked at some online resources about how to make sure I didn't get surprised with any fees at the airport. I reserved a seat in the emergency exit row for extra legroom and paid for my bag in advance. I got to the airport two and a half hours early. The flight left on time and everything went just fine. I was actually scared to fly this airline but now that it worked for me once I'll probably fly them again in the future. Especially since the price was less than half of what a full fare carrier would have charged me for the same route.,1
Durban to Cape Town with FlySafair. Was an excellent flight. Bought a special airfare of R399 to Cape Town. Was a little worried after reviews that I read. Staff were friendly and well mannered. Flight was on time. Check in was easy and quick. Will definitely use them again. Thank you Flysafair.,1
"Air Akasa will weigh every single thing you have and then charge you. Per kg extra baggage charges are 550, too much and they call themselves affordable. Never fly with this airline, staff behaviour is not good.",0
"My flight from Beijing to Toronto with Hainan Airlines was great. The food and the seats were nice, the cabin was clean and washrooms are tidy. The cabin crew was very kind. Hainan Airlines is a great airline to fly with. The inflight entertainment is fun to watch with great games.",1
"I had booked a flight in Go First. They canceled the flight a few hours before travel. When I asked for an alternate they started behaving very rudely. I had to buy tickets at a higher price from other lines. I wanted compensation from Go First. I was trying to reach them via phone call, I called every phone number of Go First available, none of them responded. I had to pay extra money for staying in the hotel also.",0
"Prior to booking this first class ticket I confirmed with American there were dedicated flight attendants for the few seats in First Class and they were strictly monitoring and enforcing mask wearing. On my flight, the passenger next to me, kept taking his mask off. The flight attendant knew him and kept stopping to chat with him and also served him 8 huge glasses of Chardonnay, despite the fact he was visibly intoxicated. She even opened a fresh bottle at his request as we were landing. When I asked the flight attendant to enforce the mask policy she first told me she did not notice he wasn't wearing a mask, which is so lacking in credibility as she stopped at least 20 times to chat with him. When I confronted her on this she laughed in my face. I sent a complaint to American today and received a form email back reciting the law and how seriously American takes it. Do not fly American. They do not care about their passengers and do not enforce their own policies or the law.",0
The worst of the worst airline. More than 7 out of 10 flights are delayed or cancelled on this route. They dont tell you until you are at the airport so your left sitting around. My wife was delayed over 7 hours 2 days ago. I got to airport only to be told i am delayed.,0
"Well to start the boardings time was at 430 they were late with that next we find out the plane was too hot for us to get on. Ok so then we finally got on its it's hot as heck. The seats are small, seats don't recline and there were no real pockets to put your stuff in. Next the tray table was so small you couldn't fit anything or there. Next let's get to the snacks.  No water no coffee nothing was free for the customer. I get it fly cheap one stop ok, but still customer would come back even if you gave them some free snacks, pops, chips, something. So for me I dont know if I'm flying again with them. Worst experience ever!",0
Brussels to Dublin. They trick in customers in more and more add on purchases. They will sit you apart and bombard you with messages to upgrade.  It was last time I was flying that airline.,0
Excellent service and so kind and nice and polite staff Two person in specific Mr. Mannan and Ms. Shirin on flight QR 1380 on 1st February were excellent and were very polite and very supportive. Excellent service provided.,1
I flew back from Kuala Lumpur yesterday in business class. The seats are comfortable and the service onboard is great. The only bad point was the luggage we had to wait a long time to collected them after landing. As I was in Business I didn't think I would have to wait.,1
"Tallinn to Dubai. Departure time on second leg Riga to Tallinn changed 3 times. One day before departure flight Tallinn to Riga cancelled so I had to call and rebook to an earlier flight. Stay over instead of one hour, now 8 hours. Flight back from Dubai to Riga delayed by 2 hours and flight from Riga delayed by 2 hours. All that without as much as a free drink for 2 Euros offered. A free upgrade not to dream of. I can say easily the worst airline in Europe.",0
"They change the date of my booking and there's no alternative, when I request to cancel it they deduct more money from my amount while it's there mistake to change the date. Worst customer service, waiting on hold for 43 minutes after they replied and then hang up the call.",0
"Awful I paid for row 7C, with no seat in front of me. They arbitrarily changed me to 21C, a so called exit row, but the second set of seats with no extra leg room. The flight is delayed over an hour. They made me check my carryon. Overall, terrible experience.",0
"Frontier is the worst airline I have ever flown on. The service I received was horrible and both my flights were delayed, causing me to miss my connection. There is zero regard for their passengers, and it shows. Extremely disappointed in this experience and I will make sure to tell everyone I know to stay away from this airline!",0
Basel to Barcelona. Will not fly with this company again. They cancelled our flight only after 6 hours of making us wait even though they knew the flight was cancelled 6 hours before. Then once they told us they made us wait another 2 hours to try and get us to leave without reimbursing anyone or paying for hotels like is required. After waiting they kicked us out of the airport and did not offer another flight for 3 additional days after the original flight.,0
I love the new seats by Qatar Airways ergonomical and comfortable for long haul. But I would like to give a special mention to the stewardess who attended me. I sat on seat 51C. She was Thai nationality  and her attentiveness and her service is beyond 5 star. She makes everything possible to make our trip back home memorable. So helpful and always with a smile from beginning to end of the journey.,1
"Flew Turkish Airlines from Belgrade to Munich via Istanbul. Excellent airline, great food. The best European business class product definitely. Hard and soft product. On time. Best seats, best food, the best lounge, transfer. I love flying with them, because they recognize their loyal customers very well.",1
"Phnom Penh to Macau. Within 3 days we took 2 flights with Bassaka Air, Siem Reap to Phnom Penh and Phnom Penh to Macau. It is a great option to travel between the  Cambodian cities. In the first flight we had no incidents, everything went great, boarding, flight, great service. The 2nd flight was delayed for 12 hours and with no other options they abandoned me at the airport for that long. When trying to reach the company to understand what happened, after a few emails back and forward they just left me with no response, even after I reminded them weeks later. It's easy to provide a service if everything goes as planned. When something wrong happens is when you separate the best from the others. This was simply the worst possible customer care service. A",0
Customer service was on point! I travel with just a backpack so this airline was the right fit for me. There was a bit more room in the seats than other big airlines. The seats are comfortable too.,1
"We had tickets booked by Malaysia Airlines to fly from Auckland NZ, to Mumbai, India during Dec 2020. Due to the pandemic the flights from NZ were cancelled. We now need to travel to India in December this year, however I understand the flights are not operational to NZ route. But dealing with their customer service team is a nightmare. First of all there is no option at all for a refund or a partial refund minus the booking fees or whatever. Secondly I have hardly had any responses to my queries about my refund on compassionate grounds as the only reason we need to travel is due to personal family reasons. We would prefer flying them as we already have tickets, however if they aren't operating flights, they should at least partially refund our money so we can make other arrangements. So far I have 0 responses to my messages to them. Their call centre staff were unable to help me with our flights as they are unsure when the route will begin operating. Now we have booked our tickets with another airline to travel in Dec with the unwanted Malaysia airlines tickets still on our name which they only keep extending so we can rebook another date, even though we do not have travel plans in the future after this date. Now it is not my problem that they aren't operating on the dates we need to fly on. Again I would have preferred using them but since they aren't operating flights to NZ, I am stuck with an extra ticket to India on which I may not travel anytime soon in the foreseeable future. Thanks Malaysia airlines for nothing. Customer service gets a 0 for ignoring all my messages. Will never choose to travel with them ever again. Happy to pay extra for other airlines and get the assurance of customer service.",0
"Madrid to Vienna. I couldn't do an online check in and at the check in they informed me that I am on a waiting list. I still had to go to the gate and wait there till everybody finished boarding. There were like 10 people in the same situation than me. Iberia explained me that this was normal. After everybody boarded they called 3 more people from the waiting list. I didn't get to be on the flight. They gave me the money back but I dont care about that. I wasted a lot of time, missed important business and got a lot of frustration from Iberia. I will never choose this airline again.",0
"Ottawa to Timmins via Toronto. Worst trip of my life. Cancelled the second leg of my trip after I already completed the first. Cancelled for no reason! It was a beautiful clear warm day. No apologies given. They just want you to wait until they can fill the plane. No compensation except except some food from the Porter cafeteria. Forced to sit in Toronto for seven hours. Seriously messed up my plans. On the return trip two days later my flight was cancelled again. How can they get away with this? I told them to refund the tickets, and hopped in a rental car and drove seven hours to get home. I will never fly Porter again.",0
Missed second flight because when we landed there was another plane in our terminal. American refused to get us a hotel because they blamed the weather even though it was their fault. Forced my toddler and pregnant wife to spend the night in the airport,0
Due to your malfunctioning aircrafts me and my husband almost passed out due to the heat prior to departing. It was over 45 minutes with a 100 degrees inside aircraft and instead of letting us out to Al least wait for issue to be resolved. Will never fly United Airlines.,0
"Athens to London Heathrow via Paris CDG with Air France. Check in at ATH was easy and trouble free. The business class lounge is clean, comfortable with hot and cold food, snacks and drinks. On time departure,  A320 with smart interior colours and standard 3x3 seating with middle seat free. Good leg room. A choice of champagne, orange juice and water offered after take off. Flight attendant checked to ensure that I had requested a vegetarian meal and it was offered with the meal service. The FA in business was very polite and attentive, asking if the meal was satisfactory. After dinner sweets and chocolates were offered. Staff explained transfer procedure at CDG which I appreciated. CDG to LHR was good with attentive crew and a snack served. Highly recommended.",1
"Flown over 30,000 miles with this airline I'm a medallion member My flight was canceled on my way to Orlando. After I spent over 8 hours at the airport they sent me back to Jackson, Mississippi. I think I'm entitled a refund for my ticket, not half Of the ticket. Been on the phone with them for hours. They keep transferring me and nothing happens. I'm very disappointed",0
"Seoul Incheon to Hong Kong. Seats was big, long haul seats in regional routes. Meals well served with desserts and appetiser in this 3 hour flight, with ice cream and seasonal fruits. Cabin crew was nice and friendly. However, the entertainment system was quite outdated.",1
"Houston to Nashville. Four plus hour delay, no food coupons, no looking into other airlines for another flight. Nothing. I have flown with United before, and have always had delays and terrible service. United Airlines service is minimal at best, with zero interest in it's customers whatsoever. This is my last flight with United.",0
"Shannon to New York with Aer Lingus. We travelled as a family of 4 with 2 young children, 3 year old and 1 year old. We had a good flight on way to New York. On the return flight my 1 year old was tired and ratty, we were travelling over night, the flight crew were excellent, so helpful and attentive, it made our journey much easier, definitely should be complimented on their good work.",1
"Very impressed with Germanwings. The flight was punctual, crew was professional and polite. I traveled Smart economy. Boarding was quick and efficient. The aircraft was clean, the Lavs were spotless. There was good legroom and we were given a choice of beverages and substantial snack.  The arrival was ontime, and luggage was delivered promptly.",1
"Incompetent organisation with delays and cancellations a regular thing, just rubbish. There is no one to really complain to and if there was, all you get is operational reasons. They steal my time with no care at all. In these Last few weeks I have had a flight canceled and had to wait 3 hrs for replacement, also sat on runway fit two hours waiting for them to fix it, the flight I am now waiting for has just been delayed and the plane type changed so I now have a terrible seat,  but who cares? Not Qantas",0
"Melbourne to Singapore. The worst inflight service I have had, the attendants we encountered was rude, talked to each other loudly, having a casual conversation during serve the food, while we were waiting one of them to approach us. They served your food withought saying anything. Even gave an attitude that we did not pass our trash to her because she assumed she could not reach it.",0
Flying from Belgrade to Brussel via Munich with Lufthansa was very nice. Departure on time on both leg and the crew was friendly. Drinks and snack was for free. The seat was comfortable and the plane was clean. I would fly with them again.,1
"Our flight time was changed from 08.50am to 6pm! I missed all connecting flights, had to pay for another hotel in Abuja and was stuck in limbo. I had already checked out of the hotel. The flight change wasn't communicated and we only discovered when we got to the airport.",0
"From reservation to touch down in Paris, everything was perfect! All EVA Air employees make you feel like an honored client. The Infinity Lounge in Taipei was not up to my expectations compared to the high quality of service otherwise. On the outbound flight from Paris CDG to Taipei I flew Premium Economy which was also a very nice experience, and well worth considering on a 13h flight. The seats and more intimate cabin make a big difference. All in all, I highly recommend EVA Air, as for me this airline brought back the pleasure of air travel. I also felt very safe due to the high safety standards of this airline.",1
Jacksonville to Charlotte. Poor service both ways. Why use mobile ticket when one has to go back to counter after waiting cause there is issue with ticket? What is the purpose of pre check if line not open? Flight attendants subpar. Multiple flight delays on way to this destination with aa personnel ever changing excuses. Uninformed reps in airport telling clients the can stay in airport then being run off by security telling us we have to leave terminal. Supposed to be best airline of 2017 but definitely not. Worst than Spirit and United combined.,0
"We flew to Miami and then Panama on American Airlines, I usually travel with United and have travel status with United. I remembered why I do not like flying with American. The staff was very unfriendly and unprofessional at the airports in Savannah and Miami on the return. The flight in Savannah was delayed two hours, no fault of anyone there but the girl at the counter sat around on her phone and she could have had people put tags on their bags because it was a full small plane and instead she caused us to sit for an extra 45 min and the airline stewardess were annoyed at her and yelling at her and they all were arguing. The stewardess were absolutely right, she caused us to just barely make out flight to Panama which was the only one that day but unfortunately our bags did not make it. SO, we ended up stuck in Panama without any bags on Christmas eve. No clothes or toiletries and we could not leave to portobello like our travel plans called for. The next day, Christmas, I spent hours at the airport trying to find someone from AA to get me my bags that had come in on the flight. Literally one person working for the entire airlines. Unless it's the only airline going there, I will never fly with them again.",0
"Absolutely the worst customer service. Nobody is accountable for anything and has no clue of what is happening. I flew from San Jose to Los Angeles on February 11. I accidentally left my wallet on the aircraft. I got a call saying I left it and should collect it from Lost and Found the next day. When I went to LAX nobody had any clue about where it was. The lady at Lost and Found was not helpful and rude. I spent 4 hours at the airport going from counter to counter. I have a voicemail recording saying they found my wallet and then asking me to pick it up. I even spoke to someone over the phone and confirmed the same. However, in less than 12 hours they lost my wallet while getting it from the gate to lost and found. I made several attempts to reach them but nobody answered the phone. When I called the customer service number, they had no clue of how to handle this issue. I filed a report online, but they didn't even respond to that. It shows how careless the employees are with customers' property. They lost something which they themselves found! In less than 12 hours they couldn't even transport it from the gate to the lost and found department. Pathetic.",0
Amritsar to London Heathrow via New Delhi. I have seen the Jet Airways quality of services going from bad to worst. The boarding experience at Amritsar and Delhi was pathetic and the inflight experience was the worst in my experience of 25 years travelling. I would rate Jet Airways as poor value for money,0
I flew from KL to Miri and it was very pleasant. I was late and was the last passenger to board but Air Asia were very nice about it. Flight was smooth and arrived on time. Can't think of a single thing to criticise them except food could be better.,1
Will never fly AA again. The experience at Dallas was terrible. Flight was late therefore missed flight. Boarded another flight but told to get off due to mechanical problem. Very little information on what to do next. Sent to four different gates. Treated like cattle. Never made it out that day and no guarantee to fly next day. Forced to go to a different airport and buy another ticket on Southwest. No apologies by AA personnel. Customer service was the worst I've experienced in over 50 years of traveling.,0
Athens to Moscow Sheremyetevo return. New A320 polite staff good food. Price was cheap. I would fly again with Aeroflot.,1
"From the moment of boarding, the Air Canada rouge crew was upbeat, positive and made you feel valued as a customer. A special mention for the purser, who handled all the responsibilities of her job with panache and lots of personality, and another staff who was a delight to deal with, and went out of her way to make people feel comfortable. I must say, because of the crew that day, it was one of the nicest flights I have been on. ",1
"We had booked meet and assist support for our Autistic son it was such a relief for us and him to have been supported so kindly throughout the flight process He was checked on throughout the flights, escorted to lounge and collected for boarding Brilliant care and support Thank you",1
"My wife and I flew CityJet from Amsterdam to London City. Left and arrived on time, aircraft almost full. Crew very good, snack and drink served on short flight. London City is a great airport to use, we were at Victoria station within thirty minutes of leaving the plane.",1
"San Francisco to Austin with United Airlines. We had a weather delay of 5 hours, then the plane arrived but we had no crew and pilots. How can you not know about the weather prior to it actually occurring and adjust to it? They charge you for everything too. I'm hoping I never have to fly United again! I could drive to Austin faster next time!",0
The experience from Norfolk Island to Sydney was amazing. Ground crew at both ends made my day travelling with my 90 year old aunt so easy. I cannot speak highly enough. Thanks to all concerned.,1
"I was a little hesitant to fly Frontier as I had read some of the reviews, and it seemed a lot of folks had issues with the airline. Let me just say, I'm glad I didn't pay much attention to those reviews. My flight from Houston to Denver was an absolute breeze. We took off early from Houston and got to Denver early, and we didn't have to wait to be deplaned. I highly recommend upgrading your flight to the ""works"" when making the reservation. I will definitely fly Frontier again.",1
"I would give 0 stars if possible. Worst company ever. They have all kind of additional services to add to your flight ticket, like priority boarding which I paid, but at the airport in Bucharest the lady at check in told me that they don't do such things and they don't have priority boarding. Moreover, I have paid extra money to have a meal on board and I was never given one. Now I am trying to contact them and I am waiting around 1 hour at phone only for the call to be disconnected after due to some technical issues on their end, as the robot said. They don't answer on emails either. I don't know why nobody checks them.",0
"Dallas to Maui. The service in first class going over to Maui Hawaii was very good on June 15, 2018. However, the service coming back to DFW on June 23,2018 was very bad. I would say the people sitting coach had better service. I had a staff member that must hate her job because they acted as if it was a bother to answer any questions. The meal was very under par, I was served a vegetable dish that consisted of a plate of rice and 2 peas and 2 cubes of sweet potatoes. I will be rethinking my next flight with this airline again",0
"My flight was from Istanbul to karachi via Doha from Sabiha Gokcen airport Istanbul, we were two families total of 7 persons, while checking in for the boarding we had some issue with some missing documentation of my sister in law, this review is specifically for the staff of Qatar Airways boarding counter specially Mr Nazim who helped us and guided us through out to full fill the requirements. My whole family is really thankful to him for helping us out. Thank you Mr Nazim, keep up the good work! All the best.",1
"Gatwick to Bilbao and I enjoyed the flight.  Staff excellent. Flight was on time and comfortable. Was kept imformed at all times. First time flying with Vueling Airlines.  Had a problem with name on ticket, rang them and changed it without any problem. ",1
"So we asked for an upgrade to business class from premium economy which we bought a year ago so they said they will try and after 6 days of nothing they change our flight tickets and downgrade us to economy even though we bought premium. I am very upset and disgraced, not going to do international travel with them again.",0
"Manila to Auckland via Bangkok. All flight crew were extremely pleasant and polite. The service was exceptional. Seating very comfortable, enough leg room for myself at 1.8m tall. Meals were outstanding. Overall my best flight to date. Only exception Singapore Airlines 40year ago. I rate my experience 10 out of 10.",1
Just took a round trip to Santiago Chile flying business class on a 737. On time departures and arrivals friendly staff and clean cabin. Food and drink service was very good.,1
"Frankfurt to Amsterdam. My flight from Lyon to Frankfurt was delayed and so I missed my connecting flight from Frankfurt to Mexico. I was stuck wondering around how to get to the service center for hours and when I finally got there they gave me 'compensation' with a night at a hotel. The day after, they booked me a flight from Frankfurt to Amsterdam and from there to Mexico but surprise the first one was also delayed. Honestly what is up with this airline, I will never fly with Lufthansa again. I've been early to the airports and gates all the times for there to be a stupid delay thus making me miss another flight.",0
"Winnipeg to Kelowna. Incredibly friendly staff, flight was on time, will most definitely use Swoop again. Arrived 10 minutes early, comfortable flight. Very pleased.",1
"Poor service, self check in and self baggage service. Staff not most helpful. Multiple halts on boarding the plane, which is likely to be delayed. Packed us in the shuttle bus like sardines. Will not recommend flying with Icelandair, but you don't have much choice when you want to visit Iceland.",0
Was headed back home from the holidays. Southwest Airlines flight attendants on flight 1857 from Baltimore to Nassau on December 1st were awesome. I don't like flying but one particular lady stood out and made the entire flight unforgettable. Their service was great and a wonderful team. It was my first flight with this airline it sure won't be the last. Excellent service.,1
"I do not recommend it, the worst airline in the United States, bad service, irresponsible, what matters least is the passengers. We flew from Newton Orleans to Guatemala, my whole family. the flight was delayed in the connection, then we were locked for 25 minutes because the door could not open due to a mechanical failure of the plane! We lost the next flight, and they tell us ""the next flight tomorrow at 7 in the morning and arrives in Guatemala at 4.30 in the afternoon, and only option.",0
Helsinki to Gatwick. The flight is due to leave just over an hour late. Had to stand inside the bus waiting to board outside the plane for 25 mins. The plane was filthy on boarding.,0
The worst airline especially if you are travelling with an infant. No allowances as cabin baggage for the baby had to stuff everything within 7 kgs for myself and my baby. Had to throw away most of my baby's food ground staff didn't even show consideration after I told them she needed special milk due to allergies and I had 4 hour transit in Kuwait airport. Inflight entertainment was non existent meals and service was very poor. The service was worse than the cheapest budget airlines!,0
"Istanbul to New York JFK. The seat is quite spacious and comfortable. However, many seats do not provide direct aisle access, which is now a norm for a top business class. Cabin staff are courteous and helpful. I had better meals on board of some other airlines, food here is quite delicious and presented beautifully.",1
"I was a advid jet blue frequent flyer but with the pandemic and this situation I will rethink my next flight. I just boarded my flight to find out JetBlue no longer blocks seats to allow for social distancing. I'm appalled I was not notified ahead of time while booking my flight and again when I checked in. My row with me in it made it full. It was packed in surrounding rows, back and front side to side. I asked to be moved to a seat in a row that is ""open"" and ended up in back row. That's fine but I specifically paid extra to select my aisle seat under the impression middle seat was blocked. Jet blue took my money and ran with it",0
"We had such a lovely flight home! Nice and quiet. Flight attendants were very friendly and helpful. Jaime especially was so sweet and helpful! He's the best! All the attendants talked to the kids on flight. A few of them came on crying, but attendants calmed them right down. Very sweet people!",1
"We were scheduled to fly Malaga to Toronto via Lisbon on March 20, 2020. I checked online and saw, to my horror, that TAP had cancelled everything. We received no notification or any assistance, and so far no refund. They did this to thousands of customers who had flights to and from Spain, just as the Spanish announced their coronavirus measures. We spent a week, scrambling and stressed, trying to get home to Canada. Other airlines, notably British Airways, Easyjet, Air Transat and Vueling carried on as normal and even added additional flights. TAP abandoned us to our own devices without a word. How they remain a part of Star Alliance I'll never understand. Never again.",0
"Winnipeg to Victoria. I needed an inexpensive flight to visit family and this was perfect! After reading all the airline's rules and regulations, especially the baggage rules, I took up the challenge. I took up this challenge to only pay for my flight, no extras, no frills. I must admit I was a tad anxious having read so many negative reviews. The flight went as expected. It was on time and without incident. The landing in Victoria was a bit heavy but I have experienced worse with other airlines. If you know what you are purchasing this airline was amazing. Remember no frills, just your ticket to your destination. Thank you Flair Air. I got to visit my sister one last time.",1
"London to Mauritius. We are fortunate enough to have flown with many different airlines including low cost carriers and also upper class cabins on other premium airlines. Without a shadow of a doubt, the whole British Airways experience is the poorest of them all both with the aeroplanes and seats, the general service and experience but more importantly the poor customer service following the bad flight. I truly feel that this airline deserves to go bust because of the truly disgraceful approach to service and the product they deliver. I begrudge flying with them and given the option I always choose a different airline.",0
"Absolute joke. Repeatedly, this airline has too few crew members, mechanical issues, or logistical issues. Over and over again. Incredibly incompetent and becoming increasingly expensive.",0
"Birmingham to Budapest via Brussels. Despite asking when booking and when checking in if there was enough time to change planes at Brussels, I was sold a flight to Budapest with 50 minutes to get between the two flights which is clearly not enough time because you have to go through all security again. It was an early evening flight so it wasn't even busy but there was just not enough time to get through all of the security checks. Brussels Airlines deliberately book you on flights through Brussels when they know that many people will not be able to make the connection. On the day I travelled there were approximately 60 people checking into a hotel for overnight stay because they had not been able to make their connections. This is only one hotel, I believe that they use multiple so the true number was obviously more than this. I have never flown with Brussels Airlines before and never will again, but I heard people saying that the happened all the time with Brussels Airlines. I raised a complaint with Brussels Airlines in October but am still waiting for a response three months later, having sent reminders three times.",0
"My boyfriend and I booked the basic fare from Hamburg to Rome Fiumicino. I didn't expect much because Germanwings is a low cost airline but it was great. The staff were friendly, when boarding was completed the pilot welcomed us all on board and although we had just booked the basic fare the stewardess gave us drinks for free. Departed and arrived on time. The first time I was in Rome I waited nearly 40 minutes for my bag but this time they were really fast. Would recommend flying with Germanwings.",1
"Kathmandu to Los Angeles via Guangzhou. I chose China Southern because the price was right and the layover time was just two hours rather than 8 hours or so with other airlines.  I was very pleased with these flights and pleasantly surprised. Both aircraft were very clean and in very good condition. The seat in economy was very comfortable and with plenty of legroom. The movie selection was superb. The food was very good and tasty. The stewardesses seemed anxious to please and very accommodating. Most of all, the staff was very efficient and made me feel like an honored guest. The stewardesses were very charming, polite, welcoming, and attentive. I have recommended this airline to my brother in law, who flies to China for academic conferences at least once a year. He had never heard of it, and upon checking it, was surprised to find what a large fleet they have. Kudos to you, China Southern, for your superior service and quality!",1
"Johannesburg to Rome via Dubai. I have been waiting for longer than months since my flight last July with no response from Emirates all.  First I had no idea why Emirates is delayed for 6 hours out of JNB was because of technical issues which caused me to missed my connecting flight to Europe. The IFE on my seat does not work since this is an old plane that I've take and this is unacceptable for me to go without IFE on such a long flight. Upon arrival into Dubai, I was rescheduled to another day with Emirates as the result of the delay flight. I have nowhere to sleep by then. This is unacceptable and a total nightmare for the whole journey. After longer time since I sent a report to Emirates without any answer at all. This is the last time I fly Emirates.",0
"I will never book another flight with American Airlines at Newark airport. They canceled my flight last minute as we were about to check in, and the rude man helping us did nothing of any help at all. He was extremely passive aggressive and was severely aggravating. This is sad that this is the world we have to live in now. Like I said before save your breath before you book with American Airlines at Newark airport. If I could rate this airline a 0 I would do it a million times over.",0
Our flight was late arriving in Ho Chi Min for our flight to Moscow with no apology from the crew. They let passengers onto the flight who had been drinking heavily and nothing was said or done to turn them away the crew were unhelpful and sullen the food was inedible. On arriving in Moscow we thought we still had time to catch our next flight to London Heathrow only to be told the flight had already left. When we arrived at the desk we were given tickets for the next day and told we would be in a Hotel for the night. No apologies there was a lot of shrugging of shoulders and being told to sit over there. Rude and very unhelpful.,0
Phoenix to Fort Lauderdale. Would have been cheaper to fly a better airline. Extra fees at every turn! Horrible seats that leave you needing a chiropractor! Never will we fly with Spirit Airlines.  Treat passengers like cattle headed for slaughter. Thought we saved money by flying Spirit Airlines but in the end it costs much more. Everyone is better off avoiding this airline if at all possible.,0
Durham to Bodrum return excellent fights on new aircraft. Good service much better than easyjet etc staff very nice and helpful. Drinks expensive but we knew they would be and took our own onboard.,1
My experience with Delta was absolutely horrible. I missed my connecting flight and was forced to spend the night in Detroit airport. When I originally boarded this flight I was reassured by staff that if I missed my connecting flight there would be ticket agents available to find us a hotel and food when we landed. This never happened so as forced to sleep in the airport. Airport staff also threatened me that if I left the airport I would no longer be secure. I have never felt so scared and alone in my life. This was the worst experience of my 45 years of life. It took me over 30 hours to travel from Las Vegas to Buffalo New York. I am astonished with the lack of humanity and respect that I was shown by the staff of Delta Air Lines. It will be a long time before I fly again. Rest assured it will not be with Delta!,0
"Cancun to Toronto with Sunwing Airlines. Awful, awful, awful experience. Major delays on both ends of travel. Pick up from hotel was over an hour late. More than an hour to get luggage back when at Pearson. Never fly with this airline. So terrible.",0
"After 2 hours, 3 agents, 2 supervisors, 1 manager and a gate agent my experience with Hawaiian Airlines was horrible. Had paid for and confirmed Comfort Class seats. When boarding passes were received they were regular coach seats. In a condescending and rude way I was told the Comfort Class seats were canceled by an outside source. Comparable seats were now not available. Only option was coach seats and a Credit for what was paid for upgrade.",0
"Fort Lauderdale to Indiana. Long line to check bags, slow customer service, not friendly, crazy pricing strategy that leaves you feeling angry. On flight personnel were professional although not particularly friendly.",0
"Bengaluru to Kolkata. Great Service and comfortable journey. The flight was on time. The cabin crew were very professional and helpful. Overall, a comfortable journey. Thank you SpiceJet. Will surely fly again.",1
London Gatwick to Dublin with Ryanair. So like many we got hit with the not confirming our tickets. When we ordered or received confirmation about flight never did it mention anything regarding us needing to confirm. I have flown quite a bit and I have never had this happen to me. We apparently missed the check time by less the 5 min but they wouldn't accommodate or help out in any way. Service staff are not helpful or kind among other things. Don't ever waste your time with this company.,0
My husband and I recently returned from a trip using United Airlines. We arrived at our international destination 12 hours later than the original arrival time. Since that was mainly due to weather I can't blame United. On the way home though we had a terrible experience. Our final flight from Houston to Fayetteville was supposed to board at 6.45pm but they kept delaying it around every half hour until finally at midnight they canceled the flight entirely. There were no more flights going out that night and the next day's flights to our destination were completely booked. We were given vouchers for a hotel which we got to at 2.30am and vouchers for food for the next day at the airport. We had to book a flight to Tulsa where our family had to drive a long way to pick us up. This plane was also delayed for an hour for no apparent reason. Upon reaching Tulsa we discovered our luggage had been separated and my bag was sent to our original destination while my husband's stayed back in Houston airport. We had to drive to Fayetteville airport to pick up my bag. The next day we had to drive back to Fayetteville to pick up my husband's bag. Definitely the last time we will ever fly with United.,0
"London to Islamabad. Hopeless airline, no contact number in UK Poor customer services. No disability assistance as promised. Refusal of bulk head seats for disabled passengers. Broken aircraft seats. No inflight entertainment as listed Tv monitor on seat damaged. Poor English of crew. Use Emirates or Qatar Airways.",0
"London to Riga via Helsinki. This was my first and last time flying Finnair. Our flight AY1332 departed LHR 1.5 hours late due to a so called technical problem with the aircraft. We arrived into Helsinki Airport late and missed our connecting flight to Riga. We were transferred to a much later flight with Air Baltic arriving 7 hours late in Riga. The whole episode was very stressful and tiring.Just when we thought our nightmare was over the return journey was no better. The flight AY1076 from Riga to Helsinki was delayed due to the late inbound flight. The connection time between flights was only 35 mins. We were worried of missing out Helsinki to Heathrow flight. We arrived 20 minutes late into Helsinki at gate 10 and our departing flight AY1339 to Heathrow was leaving in 20 minutes from gate 44a. We had to run from gate 10 to gate 44a and just made it in time even though they had delayed the flight for us by 15 minutes. It was a very long and tiring walk between gates and my mother who is 77 years old nearly collapsed. Firstly, the were no Finnair staff to meet us and help us to gate 44a and secondly we should have been provided with a buggy to take us from gate 10 to gate 44a and it is a very very long walk. The whole experience of flying with Finnair was very stressful, exhausting, tiring and unpleasant. Some of Finnair's connecting times between flight are unrealistic and very ambitious. Finnair have lost my custom as well as custom from my family and friends.",0
"I will never fly with Allegiant again. I have flown with this airline before and had minimal problems other than uncomfortable seating and delayed boarding and takeoff, until today. I was told that I would not be allowed to board my flight. To my surprise, my flight had a weather advisory that I was never notified about and Allegiant had restrictions on minors flying alone on flights with weather advisories. So, after driving two hours to get to the airport and assuming that my flight would go smoothly because of the notification on my electronic boarding pass that said ""ON TIME,"" my travel plans were completely ruined. The airline was in no way willing to negotiate, we were not even able to sign a waiver. At least 10 people were kicked off of the flight and forced to reschedule or find a completely different flight. Allegiant allowed me to reschedule my flight for four days later, but this was still inconvenient. ",0
Dubai to Tabuk. I'm waiting for my boarding and I was just shouted at for a simple misunderstanding. They asked me to come 4 hours in advance simply to cover for their failure to manage the time of the flights.,0
"Worst Experience Ever! I am a frequent traveler and this was my second time with this third class airline. Last moment they cancel your flight and no refund at all. No customer support at all. I have my refund pending from January 2020 for the flight which was cancelled from their end, i wrote several emails but no reply.",0
I flew LGW to LAX on 29th April and LAX to LGW on 3rd May. Both flights were exactly on time and I got text updates telling me the same. I flew economy class on the way out and premium class on the way back. Firstly economy was absolutely fine for the price but beware that you will get charged for everything including headphones and blankets as with another budget airline but the great thing is that you order everything that you would want via the touch screen TV in the back of the chair in front so there is waiting around for the cabin crew to go up and down the aisle to serve you. The selection was OK and the service was excellent and fast but no cash at all is accepted only credit cards . You can pre order proper meals when you buy your ticket which we had done and the food was great you can of course bring on your own food. The fight back in Premium Class was fantastic it was better than some business class on other airlines I have flown with all the food and drink that you wanted and it was very nice. Seat was very big and the Dreamliner is a great plane. I would highly recommend either class but I was impressed with the premium cabin!,1
"London to Penang via Kuala Lumpur. Had 4 flights with Malaysia Airlines in 3 weeks, not one of them took off on time, the delays were between 40 minutes and 2 hours and each time we were boarded onto the plane only to sit there and wait all this time. So on the flight out of London we had been on the plane almost 3 hours before we were offered a drink. On all flights I found the staff unhelpful and uninformative. They offered no advice about missed connections on the way out and on the way back my TV stopped working 3 hours before we landed, I informed the crew and they didn't do anything at all. There was a huge mess up with seating on the way back, despite booking my seats online well in advance, upon check in they tried to put me be my husband on opposite sides of the plane. Similar things had clearly happened to other people as it was mayhem on board with people trying to move around, families being split up etc and the staff were less than useless. Getting a drink on an Malaysia Airlines flight is almost impossible, they came around with a tray of water or juice 3 times in a 14 hour flight and only did a proper drinks cart once. They don't put a menu out so at meal time you get a choice of chicken or fish and haven't got a clue what comes with them, it's like feeding time at the zoo, the staff are so unorganised! Never again, worst airline I've flown long haul with!",0
Terrible airline. The outbound flight is delayed 3 hours. For the return flight they rescheduled it really early in the morning. We got to the airport then we had a msg that it has been put back to the original time. Missed out on my  hotel breakfast to waste 4 additional hours sitting round at the filthy airport.,0
"We had flown on 27th September 2018 on Air India flight from Pune to New York via Delhi. My seat number was D45. It was a very pleasant flight. The crew was very courteous, the food was good and on the whole I would rate it as excellent. Keep up the good work.",1
"My flight from Vegas to charlotte was delayed then canceled at last minute. They rescheduled flight for 3 days later and give no refund. No apology, just very rude and no viable reason the flight to be canceled. Absolutely under no circumstance will I ever fly on this airline. Do not fall into their low price trap.",0
"The worst airline I have ever flown. Incredibly rude staff. Late. No cash or CC purchase, only phone application purchase. The internet you purchase does not work, so you cannot purchase anything.",0
"Dubai to Bangkok via Muscat. They cancelled my flight a week or so before I was due to fly due to the virus outbreak. I expected I would be refunded, but instead I received a barrage of confusing emails and text messages. I tried calling but the customer service agent was rude and refused to help me, instead directing me to a specific email address. I emailed as instructed, and they finally replied around 2 weeks later saying they will rebook my flights at a later date. This does not help me as the wedding I was travelling to attend has been permanently cancelled. I have no need for the flights anymore so simply want a refund. Upon requesting this they have now advised me to 'leave feedback on the website'! Seriously!? How is that meant to get me my money back?  I will never book with Oman Air again. I have visited the beautiful country more than a dozen times but this experience has permanently damaged my view of what is otherwise a lovely culture. What a disgrace.",0
"We had purchased a business class seat for my mother as she recently had major surgeries and her legs needed to stay elevated throughout the journey. The seat recline didn't work the entire time, the seat was normal as an economy class. The main reason for us to buy the Biz class for the comfort of her travel which was not the case here at all. I have try calling AI since last three days no answer. If you try to book the flight the calls goes through immediately but if you call for any other reason no one ever picks up. I have submitted an online feedback no respond. I have sent an email no response. We were told by the crew member that since she had an issue with her seat she would get a refund back, but how will one get a refund if there is no way to contact anyone?  This was waste of our money. I do not recommend anyone to fly Air India.",0
Do not fly SATA unless you love airports. We have been to Sao Miguel five times and experienced delays on three flights. Delays of 7 hours and 2 hours previously and we are now in the middle of what will be a 27 hour delay. They want us to fly Lisbon to Manchester via Amsterdam despite the fact that we will miss a connection again if there is a delay of 45 minutes. An inept airline.,0
"We were traveling back from Hyderabad to Bangalore with our 85 year old mother and young children. The flight was delayed by 90 minutes in total and instead of arriving at 10.30pm we arrived at 12.05am. We had requested a wheelchair for our mother and whilst getting off the aeroplane as we approached the gate, we were advised to go back and sit. As the passengers were coming through the passage we couldn't make our way back to the seats. The air hostesses were extremely rude, repeatedly asked us to go back to the seats although there was no possible way to get back to the seats. They were just not willing to listen and talking in an extremely humiliating tone. They asked us all to leave behind our mother with one person which made the rest of us further anxious. In summary an extremely annoying experience, air hostesses who are expected to be kind and helpful were extremely rude, intolerant and unwilling to listen.",0
Larnaca to Dubai via Beirut. Planes newish and food good but that was about the only good thing about MEA. Entertainment old and very limited most flight attendants suffered from attitude problems very cramped seats and worse of all the passengers ignored safety instructions throughout the flight especially regarding seat belts. The price was not cheap and I will not repeat this experience.,0
"Sydney to Johannesburg. Customer Service personnel of Sydney Airport think it's OK to yell at you because you dare to question why there is only one person checking people in, while there were 7 behind the desk. I reported this to them on their website, but no reply. I will choose a different airline next time.",0
"Newark to Buenos Aires via Miami. Yesterday, upon arrival to Newark airport I was told I could not get a boarding pass as I had not paid the entrance fee to Argentina. A United Airlines employee went out of his way over the course of an hour to get me online, provided me with the website and even carried my luggage to the area where he was able to print out the proof of payment so I could make my trip. I don't know if I have ever encountered better customer service. Without him, I don't think I would have made my flight. I am beyond impressed with United's Customer service and if I have a choice to fly in the future, it will be with United. ",1
"This was my 6th time flying with Frontier. I have had great experiences! Even when I had to change flight days, they were wonderful at helping me. I love Frontier Airlines and the crew!",1
"Delhi from Ahmedabad with one hour Stop in Mumbai. Suddenly we came to know that Mumbai Delhi Flight 9W 346 of 7.30 am got cancelled from Mumbai to Delhi. The new flight boarding pass has been given was of 8.45 pm. Which means we 11 passengers from Ahmedabad has to wait in airport for almost 12 hrs. No support, rude replies from staff of Jet Airways. We 11 passengers waiting from 7.am in Mumbai Airport and not sure if our new flight of which they have alloted boarding pass will fly at 8.45 pm.  How can a Connecting Aircraft got 12 hours late and still No facility and no regret of Jet Airways staff.",0
Melbourne to Perth return in the A330. Newer 330 was fitted with AVOD and the other older one with iPad's. Nice tasty meals both ways professional crew who were friendly and accommodating to all requests. Looking forward to the refurbishment of all the A330's in the coming year ahead. Will continue to fly Qantas as my first choice.,1
Great business class seat on the A380. Nice well rounded cabin crew. The lounge is fun. Worth the money. I have flown Emirates on the 777 which is not as good as the A380. The plane really creates a experience.,1
"Doha to Trivandrum. Not value for money. Seats very congested, very poor boarding. Always getting delayed, find insects in seat area. The toilet not at all clean. Snack provided is not good.",0
We were put on the AC1845 booked through Expedia the portion from Whitehorse to Vancouver was fine then AC Rouge to Phoenix made me think twice about ever flying again. On return we flew United to SFO great plane lots of leg room comfortable. SFO to Vancouver was a nightmare my knees still hurt and while I have never been an AC fan Rouge was the final straw. Nice looking uniforms does not a comfortable flight make. We were cramped no room for carry on. Almost claustrophobic temp hot seat lumpy and wedged between back and my knees. I am 6.1 could barely stand up after flight. I like the configuration United had 1st class then a number of rows with more space a number of rows with less leg room and then standard economy for the little people. I would be happy to pay a little more for the extra leg room or I may just drive the next time.,0
Dallas Ft Worth to Detroit. Delayed flights all the time! Not just once. Lost baggage. If you are looking to waste time sitting in an airport then you will definitely want to fly Delta Air Lines.,0
"I picked this as I needed to be in Warsaw early in the morning and this was the earlier flight of the day, way better timewise compared to the train and price wise I paid similar to the train ride with way less time spend to travel. We boarded the plane in the tunnel rather than the outdoor stairs which was good as it was very cold outside that morning. As I was asleep for most of the flight I missed out on the complimentary pastry and water but coming to landing as I woke up the cabin crew offered me the pastry and water which I took.",1
"Tunis to Tokyo Narita via Doha. Flights were on time. Cabin is clean, modern and well kept. Awesome staff and excellent catering services. Economy seats aren't the widest in the industry and can be an issue after couple of hours. But this is balanced by a very good inflight entertainment system, and power plugs to refill your phones, tablets, ereader batteries.",1
"Took the flight from Bangalore to Kochi and back. This was my first trip on Akasa. I was impressed with their efficiency, punctuality, courteous and friendly staff and clean flights. The flight landed early both ways.",1
"Chicago to London Heathrow with United Airlines. First of all, getting on the aircraft was very simple and quick. There were surprisingly few people on the flight and after we went to the seats we were assigned to, we were allowed to move and spread out. Most of us were able to have an entire row of two to three seats to ourselves which greatly enhanced the comfort of such a long international flight. We were warmly welcomed and I could see the safety demonstration well. The food and drink service was efficient and often. The assortment of drinks was welcomed, and so was the snack. The dinner, as expected in economy class on an airplane was not the best, but it did include gelato which was a treat. They provided newspapers and magazines as well. However I could never figure out the entertainment system, nor the wifi within the airplane. The darkening of the cabin was timely, the restrooms were very clean and actually relatively spacious and well lit. The staff was curtious. As well as they were helpful with special assistance when needed.",1
"Day 1, delay after delay after delay. Day 2, show up to the airport just for it to be delayed last second. This time due to the pilots working late and needing rest. So if they knew they worked late why didn't they get new pilots before then or delay sooner before everyone is at the gate ready to bored. No compensation of any form. Worst airline ever.",0
"It was a nightmare flight. I was traveling with my 84 year old mother. I was asked to exit the plane without being able to let my mother know. I was then downgraded to premium economy. I was not allowed to tell my mother where I was because they would not let me go back into business class. My mother was in a panic because she could not find me. Since I was downgraded at the last minute, the plane was about to take off. Finally a fight attendant figured out what happen and told my mother. She was still very upset throughout the flight. I understand that downgrades happen, but the way it was handled was horrible. To top it off I was only offered a worthless coupon to be compensated for the difference in seat price.",0
"Overwhelmingly poor experience. Flight departed late, arrived late, was then at the gate but unable to disembark passengers for 30 minutes. The aircraft itself was unsanitary, with dirt and grime visible on the walls, ceiling, buttons, and other surfaces.",0
"We flew the new Business Class with full flat beds. Slept like a baby. Excellent product and great cabin layout and colors. The staff, food and entertainment were also very good. KLM can definitely compete with this new product.",1
"I had a flight from San Antonio to Zurich via Washington. We got on the plane but they were driving us around the airport for 2 hours because of the storms in other parts of Texas. Finally we had to leave the plane and go back to the terminal, because the crew could not work more regarding to the regulations. We missed our connections on Washington, so we had to wait in the line til they rebooked the tickets for everyone. This woman rescheduled my flights so that I had to change one more time in London with only a half an hour time time span. Also the first flight from SA to Houston became critical because of the delay again. So I made them to rebook my flight again. So I had to stay one more night in SA, and leave 6 am at morning to New York. There I will have to wait more than 6 hours and finally get to Zurich a day later than i planned. Horrible experience. I'll never use United Airlines again! They do not cover any of my additional costs, but saying with big smile, that it was not their fault, but I can blame the bad weather.",0
Gatwick to Malaga return. We were really very impressed with this airline. Plane was very clean comfortable seats and lots of leg room. Crew were pleasant and helpful. Checking in was so quick and easy. Would definitely use Norwegian again. Well done.,1
"Hanoi to Ho Chi Minh City. Terrible airline. They charged my credit card twice for bus shuttle from Hanoi city center and Ho Chi Minh on VietJet Air website. Never used the service,because no one speak English, only Vietnamese, therefore could not get any information whee the shuttle is picking up. In Ho Chi Minh City we were told there is not such service, only in Hanoi. Called customer service many times and talk in VietJet Air customer service in Airports, but got only brush off. To this days I got not refund and likely will never get such refund. In addition, they charge you transaction fees if, you book ticket on VietJet Air website. VietJet Air never send us the tickets, we have to do at the Airport, because the customer service is very poor.",0
"A domestic flight of one hour and twenty minutes in a flag carrier on 'discount' fare cost 242,73 euros and included no onboard service or checked luggage. This will automatically keep equaling a one star review for me. I am finding it quite amusing the reviews from Canadians, Americans and British saying TAP is 'cheap' when it is the Portuguese who are supporting these exorbitant prices to travel in their own country, identical to transatlantic flights. I hope the EU Commission is as bold with TAP as it was with Alitalia and save Portuguese taxpayers and Portugal's name from this mafia of the air. Flight on schedule and generous legroom on exit row. I asked for a cup of water and crew seem worried that I was interrupting their conversation in the galley.",0
"Toronto to Tehran via Istanbul. This flight and airport was the worst travel experience we  had. The flight from Toronto to Istanbul departed the Pearson Airport with one hour delay. There was very unusual turbulence, almost through more than half the flight time from Toronto to Istanbul and we couldn't sleep. After arriving at Istanbul airport, we had about 6 hours layover time. We decided to spent this time in the town. On our way back to airport due to getting caught in traffic jam, we reached  the boarding gate after closing the gate while the airplane still was stopped at the gate. The staff didn't let us to get onboard and we missed our flight from Istanbul. After missing our flight we were told to go to the Care Point counter. This was the first office which we were referred to. They didn't provide us with any help and told us to go to the ticket sale office. Finding the right ticket sale office was like a marathon for us. There were several counters for ticket sale with Turkish Airline logo. After talking to two ticket sale office, we finally were directed to the main Turkish Airlines ticket sale office where we were told that they are not able to help us and we have to pay the full price for the business class for the flights in the next day. After that, they asked us to talk to the supervisor where we observed the worst treatment that a customer may experience. He even didn't let us to explain our story and didn't listen to us. He just asked us to contact customer care centre by phone. After about 15 minutes talk with customer care centre over the phone, they also told us that they are not able to help us. Finally after being passed to several offices and people by Turkish Airlines staff without getting any help, we decided to buy new tickets to Isfahan, Iran instead of Tehran for the next day from an agency at the airport. The new tickets were sold to us at full price without any discount for the missed flight. I showed the new tickets to the same supervisor to transfer our luggage to the new destination and also complained about his behavior with us. After all of these unpleasant stories, we went to the Turkish Airlines Hotel Desk, where they told us that because our tickets are new and not transit tickets, they cannot help us with accommodations in Istanbul, and we were forced to book a hotel from an agency at the airport.",0
Travelled on August 8th when there was a power outage at London Heathrow which resulted in missing baggage. The way BA handled is pathetic with no proper communication regarding status of bags. I called several times and had to go to the airport twice. There was much confusion with the BA people claiming 2 of the tags issued were not found in their system so no claim was made for these missing bags. No follow up though I was promised they will call me later that day on the 10th. Finally the bags arrived on the 11th but the whole experience left me not wanting to travel with BA again.,0
"Jakarta to Singapore on Air France premium economy, very comfortable for short flights and certainly better than economy. Air France crew very friendly. I have flown thus sector in economy, business and premium economy and staff are very friendly in all classes. Surprisingly good airline. ",1
Rescheduled my flight twice and the 3rd ticket they gave me had all the wrong information on it then I get ready to board my flight and they say the ticket they printed out was wrong. Now this is the 4th time rescheduling. Employees are no help at at all.,0
Travelled from ISB to IST and return in January 2013. I would never fly TK again to Turkey. I would rather take the middle eastern carriers. The flight lasted 6 hours and there was no IFE. The cabin crew were not too friendly either and they just kept to themselves. Food however was good. Overall a really bad experience. Will not travel with them again unless they improve their service on this route.,0
"Disadvantaged as an Australian Prior to the COVID outbreak we had booked flights to Italy and unfortunately due to the travel ban had to postpone our flight. When we contacted Etihad they encouraged us to postpone the trip rather than cancel, using what they call 'travel bank'. At the time we were told that the travel bank was valid for a period of 2 years depending on the circumstances surrounding COVID. With the Australian government putting a travel ban on Australians since March 2020 with no information around when the borders will reopen, we have been unable to make any plans to try and arrange our travel. A few weeks back we decided to call Etihad to get information on our options, as the 2 years in which the travel bank has been valid we have not been able to make use of the credit. Etihad has communicated that regardless of the Australian travel ban that the period the travel bank is valid is still for 2 years. What I don't understand is how can I have a credit that is ticking over when I did not have the opportunity to make use of it? What is also disappointing is that we have since been informed that if an airline cancels a flight that all passengers will be reimbursed in full. The flight we had booked was cancelled due to COVID. So if we had not done the right thing and contacted Etihad for their advice we more thank likely would not be in this position and out of pocket for 2 years.",0
"Orlando to Las Vegas. I recently used Frontier Airlines for the first time and the experience was not memorable. Prior to the departing and arriving flights, there was no proper clean up of the aircraft meaning there was visible trash everywhere like excessive amounts of food and trash on seats and floor. The workers prior to boarding improperly handled baggage, throwing them on the track and leaving them either damaged or dirty. Also, the prices this airline charges for the full flight and checked bag then extra for each carry on bag and extra for seating of choice is not acceptable when the experience and treatment of customer is not equivalent to ""high value"". I am very disappointed as a first timer with this airline and will not be returning.",0
"Orlando to Atlanta. Our family of 7 flew Jet Blue home from a Disney World vacation in Orlando. This was our first time flyers with Jet Blue. We got a great deal and decided to try. JetBlue was a dream come true airline. We give it a A plus all the way. The seats and legroom was much bigger, the checkin was awesome, baggage check no brained. We loved having Dunkin Donut coffee served and loved having a great assortment of snacks offered for the trip home. Free WiFi, the kids watched cartoons and it kept them busy. The concourse was new and not nearly as crowded in Atlanta. We liked that we could already book our seats when we purchased since we were traveling with children. They allowed us to board early and get settled. Perfect all the way. It will be our choice for the future trips.",1
Flight was 4 hours late. Started at midnight. Staff very curt and unfriendly towards irate passengers due to the delay Go first is the last airline one should opt for. Across all sectors they keep rescheduling the flight .,0
"I was travelling from Delhi to Bangkok through Spicejet flight, and it was my worst experience. I had to wait 10 hours because of the delay in flight, I missed my next connecting flight also from Bangkok to Surat Thani due to their delay from Delhi. Also they delayed first only for 4 hours, and then kept delaying 4 more times. Although they arranged dinner for delayed passengers, and i was told by the receptionist of that restaurant in Delhi airport, that this type of delay is very common with SpiceJet. They messed up my whole schedule for the next day. I missed my meeting, my next flight, and lost my money of next flight ticket. Will never travel again with this airline!",0
"Bangkok Airways cancelled all flights due to the smoke haze from Indonesia. Unfortunately the information at the airport and from call center was close to zero. Hundreds of people missed their connection flights, I have missed two and had to cancel my whole business trip. There was one flight between 6 and 10 pm but no explanation from the staff why there is no other flight or if there's any other flight.No announcements at the airport. ",0
"I was nervous after reading the reviews but everything was ok. Plane was new and we arrived on time. Cabin crew were nice but they don't speak much English. Given bread, juice and coffee for free. Great comfort for a good price.",1
"Houston to Frankfurt via Montreal. I showed up at the Houston airport without my passport and there was not time to go home to get it and return. The flight had been booked through Priceline so I called them. They said I was out of luck and there was nothing they could do. Then I tried calling Air Canada who the flight was through. The Air Canada lady worked hard to find an alternate route to Tel Aviv the same day since I had a tour starting the next morning. She was able to get an alternate route booked for me later in the day at no extra charge. I loved the plane, the food, and the personnel, not to mention that Air Canada was more affordable for me. They will be the first option on my list for my next flight overseas!",1
"Traveled with my family from New York to Guangzhou on 19 Aug. This was our second time with China Southern, and we can see their improvement in many ways. The cabin crew  were warm, kind and patient. The food was good, and the onboard entertainment was diversified. The price of the duty free goods was fair. There was one thing keep bugging me, as there were so little space on the end of the seat when it's flat. Anyway, it was a pretty good flight. Will choose China Southern on this route in the future.",1
"Manchester to Toronto via Moncton. Terrible experience from start to finish. Budget airline now nothing like the airline we travelled with years ago so dont be fooled into thinking it is an upgrade airline, I would compare it to as poor Ryanair. 3 out of 4 flights were delayed, no meals given, no apologies, no compensation whatsoever. Baggage did not arrive on our onward flight. What more can I say only I will never fly with Air Canada rouge again. They offered us discounted flights for this year, but who would want to go through that experience again, we are pensioners for goodness sake.",0
Manchester to Cancun. The flight was great with no delays on either of the flights! The in flight entertainment had loads of films to watch as well as TV shows and a variety of games. The meals were great and lots of them and we even got complementary drinks and food too. Cabin crew really friendly and a good environment to spend a 11 hour flight in and really comfy as well. Definitely recommend!,1
"Heraklion to Athens with Sky Express Airlines. I was a bit worried reading other reviews, but my flight was on time, they give you access to lounge for free, they give snack on the plane, honestly it had been a long time since I had airline treatment like that. I was impressed and loved this airline.",1
"I am flying Houston to Las Vegas with Spirit Airlines and I have not been able to get a boarding pass yet. When I tried to check in, prepay for my bags, and select my seats, I repeatedly got the following message ""We are unable to successfully process one or more payments. Please select a different payment and apply it until the balance due is zero."" I tried 3 different cards with the same result. When I tried calling customer service for help, none of the automated recordings helped and there was no way to speak to an individual. I will now have check in at the gate, pay extra for checking in, pay extra for my bags, and take whatever lousy seats that are left available, and take the chance of not being seated next to my family. I will never fly Spirit again.",0
"Hartford to Cancun. Had a trip planned to Cancun starting May 4, 2020. I called twice to cancel due to the Coronavirus. The Hilton Resort we booked with closed the whole month of May 2020 due to the virus and graciously moved our week to May 2021. That is what you would expect from a reputable business. But American Airlines would not grant us a refund or even give us a voucher that could be used for next year. I asked to speak with a supervisor but was told they were instructed not to do that. I was told that if I canceled, and the flight was not cancelled by AA, then that was my personal choice and then no refund it does not matter that the resort had closed. I countered that the Hilton graciously had moved our week to next year. I was told that was the Hilton they were the airline. I will never fly AA again. Both phone calls went the same way.",0
"Pay extra money for First Class to Houston then from Houston to Mexico. Sorry, you paid first class you can enter the VIP Lounge. Never heard of airline you pay first class and you can't use the lounge.",0
After reading a few negative reviews about this airline I was quite concerned about travelling with them. I found the staff pleasant and I had enough legroom short stopover at Reykjavik gave me time to stretch my legs and go to toilet which were immaculate. Only complaint is that they take credit cards instead of money.,1
"The worst airline in the world! I have traveled many many times but this airline is horrible. We were traveling from Abbotsford to Calgary with 2 kids and got to the baggage check in within the hour, their counter was already closed and there were 15 other people waiting in the line up. When we called their customer service they said the only way to catch this plane is to leave your luggage behind. Horrible experience, this was my first and last time using Flair Airlines.",0
"Qatar Airways always deliver superb service. The service is the best, the food is amazing, and the new Qsuite is the best ever. I will highly recommend this airline.",1
"Brisbane to Sydney. I was skipped to be said thank you from the crew, even I said to her and she said to other passengers she ignored me completely. It might be small thing but I was not treated properly. I often use Virgin Australia for domestic flight, but I am not fan of Virgin Australia anymore. I was wondering why its so difficult to say just thank you.",0
"Brisbane to Paris CDG via Incheon. Fantastic flights with Korean Air yet again. I've flown this airline several times before and am always glad each time I return. All flights on time. Aircraft are very clean and modern. Seat pitch very generous. Full service with extras like amenity kits, stainless steel cutlery and hot towels, all of which are disappearing from economy on many large carriers now. Cabin crew are always friendly and professional. Overnight layover provided at the Grand Hyatt in Incheon is fantastic, very nice hotel and seemless transfer. Incheon airport is also a great for a stopover. Highly recommend Korean Air, and hope try their prestige class next time.",1
We flew from Manchester UK to Tampa and as Delta gold members we were upgraded to business and first class due to coach being full. It was a great flight great crew and food 3 days later flew from Tampa to Texas Hobby via ATL in coach. The flights were again great snacks and drinks really good service. I feel if you are nice with their staff they are nice back.,1
"Our original flight got delayed so Delta put us on a flight the next day which included a 7 hour layover in Houston. The agents at IAD included a hotel room for the layover but the gate agents in Houston refused to give us the hotel room. They even refused to give us meal vouchers, which was extremely unprofessional and repugnant. Delta, the worst policy for a business is to make promises you can't keep and in this situation, you did just that. Extremely disappointed and frustrated.",0
Will deduct unjustified amount from your refund even if they cancelled ticket themselves. Why consumers are punished with this deduction during hard pandemic time Absolutely fraudulent company. Exploit consumers during hardest times of Pandemics. Will deduct huge amount even if cancel ticket themselves. Stay away from them.,0
The flight from Rome to Toronto 14 June was the worst flight I have experienced. Flight attendants were rude and inattentive. Most of them remained in the rear of the plane socializing. They failed to maintain even a semblance of cleanliness in the restrooms which by the flight's conclusion were filthy. The floors were strewn with wet paper towels the trash receptacle was overflowing and the sinks were clogged. Furthermore the seats had little or no padding some were actually repaired with masking tape. Only centre consoles were available for entertainment. A miserable experience.,0
"I had the most unpleasant experience that happened to me with them while I was going from Madrid to Cairo on April 18th, 2017, as I was supposed to have a one night transit in Amman under the impression that I have a free night stay at the airport hotel. But once I arrived to Amman they refused to give me the free night and said that I have to pay USD 163 in order to get a room!  They were treating me as if I'm begging and they were very rude and unwelcoming! No one helped me and I ended up sleeping on the floor of the airport as if I'm a beggar. I went to their transit office and regular office at the airport and no one helped. Good service doesn't mean smiling cabin crew or good food on flight. It means helping and assisting your customers when in trouble.",0
Flew with Spirit from Baltimore to Las Vegas. The flight was fine plane was clean we arrived on time. Already had a problem with having to pay for our bags get to Vegas waited for the bags at the carousel after 15 mins of waiting for the bags to start coming off the entire flight was told that our bags were not put on the plane they were still in Baltimore. Was told our bags would be delivered to us by noon the next day. So here we are in Vegas with nothing waiting for it to be convenient for spirit to send us our bags. The bags should have been placed on a flight once they realized the mistake they made. I will never fly with them again.,0
BA16 Singapore to London. B777 World Traveller cabin. One of the most comfortable economy class flights I have had despite the fact the seating was on the more cramped side. The ambience of the cabin was very calming and soothing and the service from the young crew members enthusiastic pleasant and courteous. Managed to sleep 6 hours made the 13 hour shorter. Food was delicious and water runs in between meals very helpful to keep us hydrated. Compared to Air France which is self service appreciated that BA crew does the water runs. One complaint is the entertainment system which featured touch screen did not work on my seat but small matter. Overall a very relaxing soothing pleasant smooth flight made the 13 hours fly by quickly. This is my new favorite airline to London and offers great value for money compared to Singapore Airlines.,1
"London to Auckland via Doha on 31st May. My flight was cancelled and no alternative flight was offered. I was told I could claim a refund, but I have still not received it. Have been told it could take up to 3 months for a refund.",0
"Flights delayed and no one around at all to say what's going on. Flight get's cancelled then we were told no compensation for this as it was due to weather. Figured ok I'll just sleep here, rude security guard say's we can't stay over night and to find a hotel. You literally left us stranded and it's freezing and you're kicking people out. What if someone had no money? This is a disgrace. They should have at least provided a hotel voucher when there is no other options.",0
"Worst flight of my life. They overbooked the flight, then blamed the passengers for not giving up their seats. The gate attendant kept telling us we were passing up a great deal completely tone deaf to the consequences of what they were asking. She then started singing Christmas songs over the intercom. We were then stranded on the plane for over an hour because they couldn't figure how to fix a ""minor"" issue. The cabin was sweltering too. I hope United gets a bag of coal for Christmas.",0
"Madrid to Hyderabad via Delhi. This is the worst airline I ever flew with. I took flight from Madrid where they outsourced to wfs not even a single Air India person was present to help, there was huge language problem and no proper discipline maintained by staff. Flight got delayed by 6 hours and on top of that systems error out causing people standing in lines for hours together and on top of it connections forget about that. Systems are no way getting up and the talk is that international flight might get cancelled.",0
Newark to Dublin. As a traveler I would never go through United Airlines after this ridiculous planning. Not only did they have us sit in the plane for almost 4 hours. They gave out one small water to everyone in that time. No one got to even buy beverages or snacks. Did I mention they didnt even have a pilot to fly the plane? Thank you all so much for wasted over 4 hours out of everyone's trip as well as 3 more hours from MSP airport to Newark. Save your money and your time!,0
"I missed my flight for Amsterdam to attend my sister's graduation. I called KLM Customer Service and they were so gracious! They guided me through the whole process with minimal fee. I can tell that they genuinely care about their passengers, special thanks to Charissa, I am truly grateful that you were the one who answered my call, you made my entire year.",1
Dublin to Chicago with Aer Lingus. Business class product very good for price paid. Food and service excellent. Clearing US immigration at Dublin makes a big difference as you land as a domestic passenger and are outside terminal in a few minutes. Would recommend this airline.,1
When people book Air Canada flights and pay full price they should be told that they will be flying Rouge so that they have the choice to decline. The seats were very uncomfortable there was no TV and the plane really looked decrepid. The flight attendants seemed to just be an extension of the the whole sad situation. I have flown Air Canada since the 50's and was always proud of our Canadian airline. I find it a shame that we do no longer compete with other fine airlines of the world. From now on unless it is an extreme emergency I will never fly Air Canada again.,0
"Dubai to Hong Kong. I have flown Cathay Pacific for 12 years and the service gets better and better. The ground staff working for CX were very polite and helpful. When we boarded the plane, crew greeted us with a smile.  I noticed the cabin was spotless, everything was clean, from tray tables to the bathroom. The menu was very good. I had chicken with rice which was heavenly. IFE was also very good, with a large variety of movies. Legroom was very decent and seat was also very comfy and I could sleep well. Overall, my experience was amazing. The crew showed passion in their work, which you must appreciate.",1
If you are a holiday maker you will find this airline diverting and fun what with its own lounges open to all passengers with free snacks and internet plus further in flight snacks and quaint privately owned airports like Koh Samui. However if you live in Samui and frequently wish to travel to Bangkok you will find it a different matter. Long waits on booking reservations through their call center very expensive flights on the Samui to Bangkok route and the ground staff indifferent. Once in the air the service is good. Delayed flights often gives the impression that if not fully booked two flights are compressed into one. I now prefer to drive to Bangkok that must tell you something!,0
Perth to London via Kuala Lumpur. Very pleasant flight on both sectors. The cabin crew were very obliging and were very prompt when pressing the call button. The A380 is very spacious and much prefer the layout to the compartment design of other airlines. The layover in Kuala Lumpur is short and also gates are close to each other. Food was ok and drinks pretty good. Will definitely choose this airline for future trips to UK on the A380.,1
Worst airline option in Mexico! Flight are usually delayed and customer service is really poor. They make you pay for carry on luggage and then force you to checked bags.,0
"Lisbon to Berlin via Frankfurt. Two very pleasant flights with very friendly and attentive flight attendants. On the somewhat longer flight to Frankfurt were twice served drinks included beer and wines and there was even a warm very tasty lunch, rolls and butter and for dessert a chocolate bar. On the short flight from Frankfurt to Berlin drinks in a wide range and a chocolate bar were served. Gladly anytime again!",1
"Employees are rude, security process is a complete disaster. I was 2 hours early for my flight and barely made the flight. A week ago I flew the same airline and my flight sat on the at the gate for 40 minutes boarded and then when landed at the destination took another 30 minutes to get to a terminal. Seems like they are biting off to much to chew.",0
"Las Vegas to Nashville. The tag on the bag came off from Las Vegas to Denver. I was called about the bag, in the terminal. Thankfully the man from Southwest called me and made sure the bag was put on the right plane. It was great customer service.",1
"Halifax to Ottawa. Porter Airlines may charge you for carry on when you book with a third party. I recently got hit with 100 dollar fee to take a 6lb carry on bag on a Basic Economy fare. If you use a third party to try to ease the cost of travel, you may be unable to take anything. I was unaware of FlightHub arrangement for finding a cheaper flight. When I booked with FlightHub, there was no way this information came up visible to see. It may be there in the extra fine print, but not where I could have made a decision not to book with Porter.",0
Flew Air Canada from Edmonton to Ottawa. Complete joke. Flight was delayed by 4 hours because an instrument was broken and apparently discovered at the very last second. Was left on the plane for an hour as they told us they were asking other airlines for a replacement part because why would we want to keep spare parts on hand? Save yourself some time and fly Westjet.,0
Bogota to Seattle via Mexico City. I purchased a ticket for my brother so he could come to the USA. I used my credit card to purchase the ticket. The next day I received an email from AeroMexico saying that I had to drive 2 hours to the airport to show them my identification. I contacted my credit card and was informed that they had approved the transaction. Turns out AeroMexico has a third party system that randomly flags charges and denies them and there is no way to override it. This is obviously a company from a developing country as this would never happen in a US company.,0
"Guangzhou to Shanghai. The plane was A321, I sat in seat 49J which was beside the emergency exit. The leg room was very huge. The boarding was on time and the plane took off on time. During the whole flight, the staff were friendly and with a kindly smile.",1
We started in BWI with 4 delays totalling 4 hours. We finally made it to DFW and have been sitting on tarmac for almost a half hour now just a perfect end to horrible trip with AA. Tried calling customer service with a seat issue before flight and the woman hung up on me. I actually got 2 voice messages on the first 2 delays. I will not fly AA again.,0
"I booked my hotel like I always do through Southwest to get points. I was to earn 10,000 points for my stay via the Southwest concierge. Usually my points hot within 4 days after travel is complete. My flight hit and my car rental hit. I was waiting to book a trip for my wife and I to Austin to celebrate a friends redo of their 50th birthday. Points still have not hit after 3 weeks and now I believe they are taking their time out of spite. Now they are telling me they have to wait for hotel to notify on how many points they need to apply to my account. This is complete rubbish, because it tells you how many points when you book and when you get confirmation email from Southwest. At the time the 10,000 points would have given me a total of 72,000 points and I could have booked a trip for us both for 69,000 points. Now it will cost 120,000 points. I travel about twice a month and it looks like this will increase to probably 3 times per month. Going to American Airlines now. Thanks for nothing Southwest. Hope it was worth it.",0
"Manila to London. I am a regular traveller on this airline and no surprise that the flight was delayed by one hour with no explanation. The meals were OK on this flight and the flight attendants professional and attentive, which seemed an improvement on my last flight. I believe this airline does not run to schedule. I am still seeking my claim against them for a delay in December 2016, which they made an offer for, but are yet to pay.  From my dealing with them they are very slow to reply to complaints if they do. I cannot recommend them and their customers deserve better, its time they started to listen to them.",0
Newark to Aruba. United cancelled my flight to give the seats to another group that was cancelled the day. Before then delayed my flight and cost me two whole days in an airport and 2 missed days of work . They offered a laughable 150 compensation to fly with them again. Please read before booking. They are over priced and have no one to speak to in customer service only emails and no phone calls or conversations. I will never fly them again and I suggest you do the same,0
"Pegasus lost my luggage, couldn't find it after 3 weeks and offered a ridiculous compensation of 248 Euros for which i had to pay 17E of transfer fee, bringing it down to 231 Euros. Not only do they not compensate for the trouble caused but their luggage refund hardly covers a bag with a few clothes. They may be able to bring people from point A to point B but don't seem to take much responsibility beyond that.",0
"Recently travelled Cork to Malaga return. Ground staff service good, flights were punctual and the cabin staff friendly and helpful. Was in row 1 and had the usual hassle with lack of space in overhead lockers although the relatively new concept of priority boarding was a help. You still had to get onboard first to get to the lockers, there is very little row 1 locker space. Flight deck kept us up to date during the flight. New food menu much improved. Baggage retrieval at both ends quick and efficient.",1
Beijing to Tijuana. The business class service offered by Hainan Airlines is top tier. Each and every detail is paid attention by the crew members and the passengers are taken good care of from taking off to landing. I would recommend it with no hesitations.,1
"Just returned from Orlando to London via Miami, that we booked direct with British Airways. The outgoing flight was really good. However, a totally different story on the return flight. We were redirected to check in with American Airlines as we had an internal connecting flight. Although we checked in shortly after the check in opened, the only seating was preferred meaning we had to pay extra for flights we believed we had paid in full. Additionally my family was split up. The AA check in would not allow us to check into the long haul flight from Miami to London. After phoning we discovered we had been checked in but not allowed to choose seats. I've spent a week seeking an apology from BA customer services and I've had several stock responses and been left with the feeling that they really do not care about their customers. From their response it is quite clear they do not see AA as part of the same group ""one world alliance"" I used to be of the view that I didn't mind paying a bit more for BA as their service was really good, but unfortunately they now seem to offer a budget airline service. I post this purely to warn other families to be aware of the danger of booking with British Airways but having a connecting flight with another part of the ""one world alliance"".",0
Delta one suites are the worst. Total rip off. Promoted as an amazing new product with privacy. Yes you have privacy but you are in a coffin. The seats are narrow and bottom half of your body goes into a 2x2 coffin with no ability to lie on side or move your legs. I would never fly again.  Better Air France or American Business Class. Changing my return flight home.,0
"They charged me triple for a luggage both ways, every time you call them you get a different information regarding a amount of bag paid and amount.  I had 5 tickets i paid for, 2 people decide not to fly, so I told that to a flight attendant and that we will be using those seats for my kid to sleep in it, since I paid for them, And I was told that its not going to happen since they have extra people waiting to be seated. To which I replied that I it is not happening. They took us off the flight with a 6 y old and canceled our tickets. The worst experience I have ever had in my life flying. Trust me, and don't waste your money, they will rip you off one way or another and you will end up paying a price of business class and flying in a horrible plane.",0
"Ryanair is the worst airline I have ever flown. We payed 344 Euros for short 40 min. return trip fight. When we got to the to the airport we had to pay 45 more Euros each just to have a boarding pass printed. We were traveling around Germany and Spain and didn't have access to computer printer, unaware of their policy. I've traveled the world and never heard of anything like that. They herd them in like cattle. There is basically no service and you pay extra for everything.  Flight was late which almost caused us to miss connecting flight. Absolutely no one is available to help or answer questions.",0
"Charlotte to Las Vegas. The flight was late to leave, but today that is normal place. We take off for a cross country flight. The sole flight attendant in first class, seems to not have her wits with her today, but she remains pleasant. They serve drinks and offer a complimentary snack, your choice of two pieces of cheese and some grapes or three edamame pods floating on a wasabi colored mush of humus. I think sometimes their chef just feels like they have to be creative, and i am sure they won some fabulous airlines chef award for creativity. Comfort food, may not win the award but I bet customers would be happier. Then we went to use the AA entertainment system, however it appeared to not be operating. The partner of our witless attendant when asked if it was working barked a quick NO and kept walking. Not worth flying American. I wonder if AA Senior management ever flies their airlines to check on service",0
"I booked a flight out of Houston approximately a month and a half in advance to Detroit. I paid all the costs for baggage online, printed my boarding pass, and checked in online. Well I spent 10 hours in the airport enduring one delayed flight after the next. After a while I stopped receiving the flight status updates on my emails. Long story short they canceled my flight around midnight with no flights available for Detroit until the following night. I financially could not afford to book a last minute flight on another airline. I was directed to the airlines agent counter where I stood in a long line for about an hour and a half to painfully learn I would not attend my important event after all. Bare fare, low ticket prices, but other ways to recoup the money by charging for baggage, seating, boarding passes, water. Someone told me what do you expect from a low class flight. I will never fly with Spirit again, it's not worth it to me.",0
"Frankfurt to Cape Town with Condor. I was nervous about flying with Condor because of all the bad reviews. I had a really good experience. I decided not to pay extra for a vegetarian meal, but it happened to be vegetarian anyway. They were constantly serving drinks throughout the flight. Flight attendants were really friendly.",1
"We were contacted by Ryanair at 1am with news that our flight from Alicante to Birmingham was cancelled due to French Air Controller strike. Despite given a helpline number we were unable to get through. The information at the airport was poor. A queue of about 100 people with 2 people on the desk. People had been in the queue for over 3 hours. Seats were not available for at least 6 days. On our return, information and support from the helpline was very poor . We won't be flying Ryanair again.",0
"Lome to Lagos. Horrible, it was nothing but a nightmare, and detestable experience. I regret ever buying that ticket and felt I just wasted my money and time.  I got to Lagos on Dec 17th with only my hand luggage. I was told my two luggages did not make it to Lagos. They were left at Lome with others because our connecting flight the ASKY airplane is small and cannot carry too much load. They will be flown to Lagos at no particular date. So, I was asked to check with them every day. Meanwhile, I had no clothes, footwear and every item I was to use for my daughter's wedding on December 22nd was in those two suit cases. I checked on the airline for three consecutive days and could not go home with my luggage. I ended up repurchasing clothes for my entire stay and for my daughter's wedding. I was only able to collect my luggages on January 2nd more than two weeks after I arrived Lagos, and the next day boarded the useless plane back to Lome before connecting Ethiopian Airlines back to Newark. Meanwhile, I had excess luggage as a result of all the new clothes I bought for my stay, since the one I brought was left at Lome. I pleaded for mercy so I will not be charged excess luggage fee but all fell on deaf ears. I gave them my debit card to pay for the excess luggage, but was told their POS machine wasn't working and as such I have to pay cash. Meanwhile I had no cash on me, the representative flatly told me there's nothing he can do. Either I pay cash or I will miss the flight. I sought for the manager, he gave me the worst response any traveler would want to hear. He blamed his inefficiency on Ethiopian Airline another connecting flight. They closed their counter, leaving me running around for cash. When eventually I brought the cash, I was told it was too late. I did not receive any apology for my luggages that I got 2 weeks after my arrival which was the reason for my excess luggage. My case was not an isolated one. It was the same for thousands of travelers who used their services last December.  All they do is ruin their customers vacation and make them cry for the airlines mistake. Stay away from them if service, efficiency and respect and dignity matter to you.",0
"Manchester to Rhodes. First time I'd heard of them so was very apprehensive but it was one of the best experiences. Plenty of leg room, the staff were brilliant and helpful. I'll be looking for Small Planet Airlines in future, thanks for making the beginning of my holiday so good.",1
I am really grateful to the crew of China Southern Airlines. The supervisor and her team were providing great help to let us boarding in time. They professionally and responsible. Thank you so much.,1
"Johannesburg to Mumbai via Dubai. Traveling in economy class I cannot complain about the space etc. I have an issue with the staff attitude to passengers. Having travelled extensively on different airlines to Europe, USA, Far East, I think I'm adequately qualified to to complain about the lack of courtesy meted out by Emirates staff. They appeared to be a disgruntled lot who found it difficult to even crack a smile. A male attendant was particularly impatient with passengers asking for any service. Even though my husband is a platinum skywards member, I don't think I will be booking on this airline anytime soon. Every passenger, economy to first class deserves the same respect.",0
"Worst airline I have ever flown with. Myself and my husband took a return flight from San Francisco to Alicante via Keflavik. After a long layover, the flight was delayed with no information about the new time. During the more than 9 hours flight from Keflavik to San Francisco, the cabin was so cold everybody was trying to cover themselves with whatever they had on hand. The little girls behind our row, were literally shaking. Of course, you had to pay for the blankets or any hot drink to warm up. On top of this, our luggage never arrived and after two days, no information about it has yet been provided to us. The name of this company is, without a doubt, very ironic.",0
"Rome to Tel Aviv via Istanbul. Very clean aircraft, cabin crew professional and friendly. Meal provided was exceptional and I have meals in first class on other airlines that do not come close to this quality. Very impressed! Flights on time and arrived on time. Pleasant experience all around!.",1
"We had very good customer service on our recent trip to Tampa! I was worried about traveling in light of the negative publicity surrounding different airlines, especially traveling with a 5 year old, a 2 year old and infant. Allowing us to board first and get settled was very helpful as well as allowing us to check car seats, strollers at no cost. But the best part was when we were coming back and my 2year old grandson had had enough refusing to buckle, wanting to get out of his seat, etc. We were in the very back seat next to the stewardesses seat. A lady sat beside him and held his hand and talked with him, got him cookies and juice, showed him pictures of her children while we were taking off and landing. She was so good and sweet with him! Really made our trip home less stressful and more enjoyable!",1
"Calgary to Toronto.  It was a horrible experience. Due to weather conditions the flight got cancelled multiple times and the customer service and call center staff was not helpful. I understand that weather conditions are beyond airline's control but what about the behavior of the crew. The crew both ways from Toronto to Calgary and back was rude. Their overall demeanor tonality and hand gestures were as if we are prisoners and they are jail guards. Unfortunately after landing, the gate was not available to disembark and we all stuck in the aeroplane 1 hour after landing and during that duration the staff was rude to the passengers and ordered them remain in seats, no going to bathroom or ask for water or anything. I wonder if courtesy, hospitality and customer service are no longer a part of airline services or its just a WestJet style.",0
Booked well in advance to fly on a Monarch plane to Malaga 10th October I am a nervous flyer and in the past have found Monarch excellent. I was upset to have found out just before boarding we had been transferred to their sub contracted airline but told my return flight was a Monarch plane. The plane was old and cramped a passenger in front adjusted her seat before take off and the arm came off in her hand. The return journey from Malaga was delayed by 4 hours and was again with the sub contracted airline a 6 euro voucher for food given out no information as to the reason for the delay. Watched Ryanair take off like clockwork!,0
"New York to Manila via Tokyo return with Japan Airlines. Crew made sure we were comfortable and well taken care of. It was my baby's first international flight, it wasn't easy traveling without my husband, but the flight attendants made it a lot easier for us. They were so friendly, polite and asked if we needed anything. Legspace was ok for me, food was good, offer of snack or drinks. Our baggage was taken care of.  Will fly JAL the next time we take our vacation.",1
"Worst airline I have ever been on, will never fly with them again. No regards for the customer and the agents at the front desk are rude and have no sympathy towards customers.",0
Super flight to and from Split Croatia. Comfy clean plane. Polite professional cabin crew. Pilots on both flights executed smooth landings. Will look to fly with Norwegian again.,1
7 hour flight from Almaty to Bangkok this month and it was very comfortable. The cabin crew were friendly and helpful without being overbearing. The spacing between the rows of seats was very large the seats reclined quite far back. Even though there were no indivdual tv screens for each seat we were each given ipads preloaded with movies which was a brilliant idea. You didn't have a huge choice of movies but most of the recent blockbuster releases were there along with some international movies. Overall it was a very pleasant flight and I would definitely choose to fly with Air Astana again.,1
"The plane arrived 3 hours later in Istanbul airport and all this time we were waiting in the security zone. After one hour of flight, we were brought food. The stewardess said that today only beef. But there was no beef. I asked where is the beef, to which she replied that there was minced meat in the sauce. I showed her that in the sauce there is only fried tomato and eggplant. My body does not accept such food, but the stewardess said that there is nothing to replace today. In front of me sat a young family with three children. After lengthy negotiations, the children were brought chicken. Thank goodness at least the children were able to eat. After a ten and a half hour flight, food was brought to us again, but this time only chicken with no choice. This was my first negative experience with Turkish Airlines.",0
New York to London. It was a night flight. I hate the night flights because I am not able to sleep on the plane. There were two meals. A hot and a cold. My place was in the 24th row. The flight is 7 hours long it is acceptable.,1
"Stansted to Rome return. I never leave reviews for such things as flights as I generally think most airlines don't provide a service worthy of leaving positive feedback, but this week I flew to Rome and returned from Venice using Ryanair. The flight out was excellent the flight crew provided really good service, were polite and very friendly. The return flight was delayed due to a medical emergency flying to Venice, where the flight had to make an emergency landing on the way out to pick us up. The flight finally arrived with less than 30 minutes to spare before the airport closed, they managed to turn the flight around in around 25 minutes which was remarkable, all the crew deserve a big thank you from all the passengers, and the company, again the flight crew were really friendly, and attentive even though they were obviously upset by the medical emergency. I want to say a really big thank you to the crew, you were excellent.",1
On 2nd March I travelled with a group of 9 ladies from Kozhikide to Mumbai. We were so well looked after by the customer relations especially Aswathi. The ground staff was exceptionally helpful and kind. The flight was on time and it was a very pleasant experience to fly with Indigo.,1
Flew on their 09.50 service from JFK to Las Vegas on 5th October. This was my first experience of VA and they were brilliant. The flight attendants were friendly helpful and polite. The cabin was pristine and the mood lighting added to the whole ambience of calm. If this is typical of the airline then what a fantastic product and I look forward to flying with them again.,1
"This airline cancels flights on people if they can sell the seat for more money. They cancelled both my flights because I had purchased the tickets as a ""Super Saver"" price. I have followed their procedures and policy's but they have stopped replying to my emails for a refund, 122 business day later. The last email was ""It's with the accounting department and they will process the return shortly"".",0
Chicago to New York. Customer service at the airport was terrible. My flight was delayed and in the end got cancelled. No voucher for hotel or a different airline and I spent more than 24 hours at the airport. This is my second time and I'm very disappointed. American Airline is trash!,0
"It was my first time travelling with Volotea, the best airline that I have travelled with. Every step of the checking process went smoothly, the staff was very professional and kind. The boarding was fast and organized, and the flight attendants were very skilled. We arrived at our destination several minutes before the expected arrival time. I definitely recommend it.",1
"Ottawa to Halifax and return. Before booking our flights to Halifax for a weekend getaway, we had also looked at other airlines. Our choice then fell on Porter Airlines because it offered better prices and better travel times compared to the competition. Both flights departed on time, and the seats were comfortable and had decent legroom. Porter only uses Bombardier Q400 turboprops, which are efficient and reliable airplanes. Snacks and drinks were offered, and were good enough on both flights. Overall, both plane rides went very smoothly, and I remained positively impressed by Porter. Highly recommended.",1
I have never in my life wasted so much time with an Airline Customer Service. Our flight was cancelled due to the pandemic. In order to change or use the voucher I spent hours. Called but waiting time was 85 minutes. Via Whatsapp 8 hours response time. Then I spent about from 1.40 pm to 3.48 getting my voucher to be applied to a new airfare through an agent via whatsapp! That's just ridiculous. I hope I never have to use Avianca again.,0
We flew from MSP into Las Vegas and had a great flight. Staff at the check in gate were friendly and had a sense of humor! Staff aboard plane were helpful and had a smile! A pleasant change from many airlines we have flown on. The fact that there is no extra baggage fee free snack and free beverage just added to the enjoyment of the flight. Our plane out of Las Vegas was delayed and the connecting flight in Denver actually waited for us! We'll book again.,1
Oklahoma City to Tampa. The absolute worst airline. Customer service leaves a lot to be desired. I was transferred 4 times. I will never fly American again. The staff in customer service for Dallas airport was very belittling to me. So he cancelled my flight because I told him to go back home.,0
"Chicago to Amsterdam with KLM. Overall, from checking in to landing it was a poor experience. The food was awful and condescending cabin crew. As an airline, KLM have continued to go downhill for the last ten years, and they are now a long haul budget airline with full fares. If flying to the USA try Delta.",0
"Salt Lake City to Boston return. First flight got delayed by 4 and a half hours and the flight back got delayed by 3 hours. Not because of weather, just because it's JetBlue. Never using JetBlue again.",0
"The worst airline. On my trip from Nashville to Dallas they made us wait more than an hour inside the plane for maintenance problems, which caused me to lose my connection to Mexico City. They offered me the next available flight. To make this experience more terrible, this second flight, ALSO had technical problems. 40 minutes of delay have passed and we are still not taking off. I missed a great date for your poor service. I always use United, but for wanting to arrive 30 minutes earlier I decided to use american. What cost me until now more than 3 hours more!",0
"Landvetter to Milan via Frankfurt. Lufthansa is always the company I prefer to fly with. Today I arrived to Milano and flew with Lufthansa. I mentioned to the Flight crew that I hade a fear of flying and that I wished to sit beside my boyfriend since I got a new seat number just before we boarded the aircraft. The flights attendants said directly that it was no problem for us to change the seats. But it was not just that, also they started to talk in a super kind way that I should not be afraid to fly, and they took me to the cockpit where the kindest pilots were. We had a really god chat and I got the chance to see how everything looks in the cockpit. During the 2 flights which was with the same flight crew and aircraft we got an amazing service and I did enjoy the flight without any fear.",1
"Ft Lauderdale to Krakow via Copenhagen. Impossible to contact their customer service to discuss flight changes. After multiple attempts and long wait times I was finally connected to an extremely rude representative. Not only was he unable to help me with my request, but discouraged me In my attempts to change my flight. My paid seat selection was changed from 8F to 35E.",0
"Totally disappointed even before the start. We should departure at 3.40 am, now we're sitting at 6.30 am in the boarding hall in the airport with no information about any other delay beside a delay to 5.45 am. Nobody can go on the plane and everyone is stressed.",0
I was flying to Jacksonville North Carolina. I accidentally purchased tickets to Jacksonville Florida. Notice the different states. Yes I know this is my fault however I am human and it was an accident. The first leg of my journey was with Delta. When we arrived in Atlanta and realized we were headed to Florida accidentally Delta took care of us and sent us to Jacksonville North Carolina as I had originally planned. When I called and attempted to change my American Airlines ticket they refused. They refused to make an exception. Very poor customer service and they did not care. They refused to even entertain switching the ticket. I was willing to pay a fee to change it.,0
"After cancelling two of my flights, KQ offered me options and I chose to travel KLM from Amsterdam to Nairobi to wait for my flight from NAirobi to Abidjan. Thought my original journey was all KQ flights, and I paid for 4 bags from Amsterdam to Abidjan, the second leg of my journey only had 2 bags covered in my baggage allowance. In other words, KQ basically robbed me as I had to leave 2 of my bags behind. Now I have to find a way to get my bags to my final destination, which is undoubtedly going to cost even more than paying for 2 bags did. I am extremely disappointed in the services that were provided. I am moving for KQ to refund me the money for my bags, seeing as I paid for a service I was not provided.",0
"It was a very pleasant experience, starting from the Check in right up to the baggage collection. There was an issue with my boarding pass, which also was handled in the best possible and pleasant manner.",1
"Again Garuda showed they take their 5 stars seriously and not for granted. Great seats in economy class, clean cabin, and their legendary service by worlds best cabin crew. It was a joy to stay for appx 15 hours a board on the non stop flight from Jakarta to Amsterdam.",1
"Tel Aviv to New York via Moscow. My experience on Aeroflot Russian Airlines was amazing overall. Amazing planes, great service, layover in Moscow was pleasant. I requested kosher meals on their website and they were given to me without a problem. Great customer service, spoke to them over the phone when I had to change my return date.",1
Sao Paulo to Bangkok via Istanbul with Turkish Airlines. In the last 3 weeks they have changed our flights 5 times with just an email notification. No change to connecting flights so if I didn't call there would be no connecting flight. Their customer service act like they are doing you a favour by changing flights. No response to a complaint made via the internet 2 weeks ago. I have used over 20 airlines and this company appears to be the Fawlty Towers of airlines. First and last time I book with them. It takes over one month to receive a refund if you don't want to change flight times every few days. I believe you have to call Turkey for this to hopefully happen.,0
First time travelling with Turkish Airlines I was very disappointed all 4 flights were late with the Doha to Istanbul being so late I missed the UK connection to Heathrow waited 7 hours for next flight no explanation was given as to why all 4 flights were delayed no apology or refreshments given. Istanbul airport is not a good place to wait for 7 hours no free wi fi toilets were dirty. Meals on the plane were good cabin crew polite and friendly.,0
Las Vegas to Springfield. Worst airline. Never fly with them. We were kicked off our flight for no reason. Was told couldn't have a new one for 2 days and they will not pay for the hotel or anything. I am a young adult on a budget and I am not able to afford to nights in a hotel in Vegas not expecting it. The staff were extremely rude and when we were kicked off they told us they would get our bag and call over the intercom where it was. When we waited an hour to hear we went and found out that the didn't get it off the plane. So we are stuck for 2 days with absolutely nothing. Worst experience of my life. I will never fly with this airline again.,0
"Amsterdam to Guangzhou. It was a very enjoyable flight because of the company with the crews. I appreciate them very much especially the purser who was enthusiastic, hardworking and dedicated. Staff cleaned the toilet when everyone came out from it, which kept it a good and comfortable environment.",1
"Perth to Singapore. Service from ground and cabin staff was outstanding, the aircraft was well presented. The seat configuration of 2x4x2 is better than 3x3x3 on their Boeing 777 fleet. In my opinion, Singapore Airlines is the best airline.",1
"On 14th August flight EK818 was delayed due to bad weather etc. However what followed was disappointing and highly unprofessional by Emirates Dubai Staff. Was put on EK2010 to JFK although I requested for next day EK213. Emirates lied by misinforming that none was available. Came to know later that those who shouted were accommodated. Unfortunate, but it works with Emirates Suffered a lot due to due to the forced itinerary. Lost additional 500 USD in hotel reservations and bus connections, Miami to Tampa. Emirates Complaint department don't have the courtesy or guts to respond.",0
"London to Dhaka via Bahrain. Customer service is absolutely appalling. They will extort every single penny from you. Plane dirty, food ridiculous. Timetable non existent. Too many faults to mention so I'll leave it there as I've had enough of this airline.  For a middle Eastern airline this is shameful as your neighbours are doing an exceptional job than you.",0
"Dallas Ft Worth to McAllen. American Airlines has by far the lowest quality planes in the fleet of any airline. The planes are old and in bad shape, the customer service is far below any customer standards. Customer satisfaction is not a priority for AA, not even close.",0
We have a trip planned to St. Lucia in October. Jet Blue cancelled our flight home Sunday so they took away a whole days vacation on us. This trip is very expensive and I don't understand why they had to cancel Sunday flights instead of waiting until Monday. I don't understand how they can upend peoples lives like this. This is so unfair!,0
"Abu Dhabi to Melbourne. Excellent customer service from the cabin crew and comfortable seats.  I also flew in December 2016 to Abu Dhabi and I was impressed by the cabin crew. However, in my experience Etihad ground staff at Abu Dhabi displayed relatively poor customer service skills and behaved in an unfriendly manner.",1
"Vienna to Delhi via Moscow. One of the worst airlines I travelled. They can delay flight or cancel the flight without any information then they  leave u on your own, not provide any accomodation or food, no representative there to assist you.",0
Treviso to Lviv. Seemed like a new plane. Very comfortable satisfactory legroom and very polite and friendly service.,1
By far the worst airline I have ever flown with. Highly recommend not to fly with American Airlines. I typically never write reviews but this has been an absolute disaster after having the flight delayed 5 times in one night to then cancelling our flight. After 6 long hrs of being at the airport waiting for the plane to arrive the staff that works for American Airlines was extremely rude and unhelpful for us passengers as they threatened to call the police on those who were upset with the many inconveniences with this airline. Will never fly through them again!,0
"There were three couples travelling between Sandals resorts in St Lucia and Antigua on the 07.50 Liat flight, this was a one hour hop between islands. On arriving at St Lucia airport, we found the check in queue was very very slow moving. Once we checked in it was announced at the flight was delayed by an hour this finally ended up 1.25 hours late. On reaching Antigua we were all waiting for our luggage and strangely each couple only received one piece of luggage and each of us had one piece missing, what are the odds on that happening, I say a million to one. The guy from the baggage handling company appeared at the luggage belt and informed us that there was no more luggage coming in and that the missing luggage had been left at St Lucia because there wasn't enough luggage space in the hold. We were all promised that our luggage would be on the next flight and at our hotel by 18.00 that day. This never happened and at this time we are still waiting to be reunited with our luggage. It seems that Liat are picking on the Tourist customer and systematically holding back one piece of luggage from each couple it is very strange that not one of the local customers had any luggage missing.",0
Gatwick to Goa return on A332. We were very pleasantly surprised at the TC product. Adequate legroom and reasonable food we had no need for the IFE. Flight was early on both legs. Cabin Crew were friendly and engaged. We would happily fly with TC on this route and aircraft type again. I am 6 ft 2 inches tall so I know the misery of a cramped aircraft.,1
"My Family traveled from Dubai to Delhi on 31 July 2019. The Flight was delayed by 3 hours. The real problem that my family faced was that Spice Jet offloaded their baggage without informing them, so my wife kept waiting at the belt for 2 hours at the belt at Delhi Airport only to be told that the baggage will come with next flight. What is this?  No airline ever offloaded our baggage before without our permission. With falling standards, this Airline will not fly for long.",0
"Oslo to Zanzibar via Stockholm, Rome and Addis Ababa with Ethiopian Airlines. A 22 hour delay, okay to understand because of problem with a Boeing 787. Whats not ok is that the airline decline to communicate with us after this event. Have contacted them 10 times and the only answer I'm getting is ""We will contact you shortly"". Posted the story on their Facebook page and the post was deleted and I was prevented for more post on their pages. We sat 7 hours waiting in the plane without being offered water or any other things to drink. Stay away from this airline. Porblems with the plane is understandable but not being willing to communictate with your customers are totally unaccetable.",0
Santa Ana to Phoenix. Those small airplanes are miserable to sit in. Smashed in those tiny seats. We always wait until the last minute to board but after boarding they announced we would be sitting in these crammed seats for an extra half hour. Would rather have shopped and walked around the airport instead. they knew this ahead of time. I have never had a good experience with American. Was very sorry I chose this but it was a short flight. Duped again by American.,0
Worst airline ever. They boarded us and kept us on the plane for almost 2 hours because they had no pilot. Do not fly with Spirit. I would pay a little more for more reassurance.,0
"On June 25, 2015 we flew back to Toronto from Rome after a Mediterranean cruise. This flight had been booked in October 2014, and the seats reserved. They changed our seats and put us in the very last row, where the seats don't recline and between 2 toilets. Apparently they can change your seats whenever they want. So we spent nine hours listening to the toilets flush, no windows, could not recline the seats, while the seats in front of us were right in our face. The food was so bad. The plane was an old one, with one small TV screen every 8 rows, and the one closest to us didn't work. We will never fly with this airline again.",0
I have CoVid and moved my flight to hopefully accommodate my illness. I was told this was a one time courtesy. I ended up being more sick than I thought. I called the next day and customer service said I had my one time courtesy and could call back later as no mangers on duty. Call wait time is up to 2 hrs. I ended up paying for another ticket on a different airline. Very rigid and unaccommodating. I will never fly with them again.,0
"Helsinki to Chicago. I was flying back from running Berlin Marathon Monday, I upgraded my seat from a middle to an aisle and to economy comfort to have more comfort. I was hoping to recline on my 9 hour flight. My seat recline button was broken, I could not recline. The purser only offered me a middle seat back in economy or free wifi. The wifi never worked. The purser said Finnair would definately refund my upgrade cost but today I received a denial of my refund. This is unacceptable!",0
"Kota Kinabalu to Kuala Lumpur. Do not use this company. My flight was cancelled for Covid 19 in April, and they will not refund for flights they cancelled and the insurance they provide does not cover this either.",0
"Very impressed with Norwegian. Both of our flights left on time and arrived at our destinations early. Efficient boarding. All passengers enter the plane together no separate queues. New aircraft on both our flights, return flight plane was so new that wifi had not been connected but apology for this was given by pilot. Refreshment trolley brought round during the flight but duty frees were only sold to passengers who wished to purchase them if they pressed the call buttons. This meant the gangways were only blocked once during the flight. Return flight pilots had great sense of humour and came out of cockpit to say goodbye to passengers. We are travelling with Norwegian again in June 2016 and are very happy we are.",1
"Luton to Rome. There was no info about any delays. People asked to proceed to the gate 11. Everyone went to the gate and people had to wait there for 1 hour! Because apparently there was a delay. Only 1 person was checking tickets from all passengers! Gate 11 area is like a stable rather than airport. No seats, no toilets. Everyone could have waited in a lounge rather than being crowded in a small area during covid pandemic.",0
Heathrow to Washington A380 upper deck club world return. Crew fantastic aircraft clean seats comfy food excellent both ways. Cannot pick fault with anything apart from they advertise 50K as being a window seat when in fact you actually cannot see out of a window from this seat. I think it's time BA invested some money on the Gatwick club world cabins. The Heathrow product is 100 times better but the price difference does not reflect the difference in standard of service and product delivered.,1
"Flew Funchal to Lisbon. It is always a breeze flying with easyJet, departures and arrivals are on schedule, the cabin crew are very professional and its product is very trustworthy. Many flag companies could learn from them. They are market aware and don't charge you any more or less than what they actually and ultimately deliver to you. A highly recommended low cost company.",1
We had a May 10 premium economy booking from Athens to Toronto at 13.00 in the afternoon. At 9.30 that morning we received a cryptic message from Air Canada apologizing for the flight disruption. We telephoned Toronto to find out that in actuality it had been cancelled due to 'overcrowded airspace'. We were fortunate enough after two phone calls to be able to rebook through London. It was simply listed as 'delayed' and as we boarded outer London flight at 1.30 it was still listed this way. They were as it tip urns out eventually rolled over to the next day 13.00 flight. This is not right not to have informed us all about the flight being cancelled. I do not think I will attempt a Rouge flight again.,0
"Goa to Mumbai. Flight was cancelled without any notice. Jet Airways flight status page was even still showing an ""ontime"" then ""arrived status. Heard of 3 other flights cancelled in same conditions that day. No refunds offered on spot, had to refer to our travel agents.",0
Jersey to Guernsey the early flight. Everyone who likes to fly should fly this route. The Trislander is a real plane and you get to see it all happening from start to stop. Excellent value and a good experience all round.,1
"Taipei to Houston. This was my home leg on a trip that started in Jakarta. Once landing in Taipei, only had less than one hour to make the transfer to the Houston flight so I was trying to walk as fast as I could. As is always the case our arrival gate was way way down from the transfer area, I thought it was a mile walk. As I approached the transfer area there were two employees of EVA Air announcing the Houston flight and I said I was going there, then they asked my name and I told them and to my surprise they handed me a new boarding pass that upgraded me to Premium Economy on the Taipei Houston flight. I was dumbfounded bue very appreciative of this gesture by EVA Air. I managed the transfer i and arrived at the airplane like 15 minutes before departure. Having tried the premium economy product before, I proceeded to settle on my seat for the long flight home. Shortly after take off we were served our dinner. The PM product has one additional serving of food, akin to an appetizer. All the food served was very good tasty and proper temperature, cold when needed to be cold and hot was needed to be hot. Service was flawless as it always has been for me with EVA. Shortly  after I slept for a while and missed the snack and then proceeded to watch movies and listen to music until landing. The second meal was also on point and I arrived rested and well fed in Houston. All in all this was my 6th trip with EVA and my 24th flight with them in 3 years and I have never been disappointed. I was very appreciative of the upgrades but my experience has always been great with this airline.",1
"I flew round trip from Ho Chi Minh City to Bangkok. The ground crew as well as cabin crew was wonderful, helpful, friendly and professional. The aircraft was clean and on time. I was impressed with the airline. Will definitely fly them again in the future. Only isue I had was the seat pitch was a little to narrow for tall people, but OK for shorter travellers.",1
"Heartless, soulless staff and company. I am disgusted and appalled at what is the worst travel experience of my entire life with this airline. This is the first time I have flown with FlyDubai and rest assured it will be my last. One hour into my flight I became very feverish and experienced symptoms that correlated with gastroenteritis. I became visibly shaky and the passengers directly adjacent to me became concerned with my wellbeing and I moved to an empty extra legroom seat which I subsequently paid for. I asked for a blanket which was refused by the air hostess supervisor who explained that the blankets were reserved for business class passengers only. She made extremely mocking gestures to me as I continued to shake and I explained that the AC was extremely low and if I kept shaking I will throw up. I have never seen anyone with as much disregard for the duty of passenger care as her. The remainder of the passengers next to me were shocked at how nonchalant she was about the situation. When I threw up in the isle, she took little notice and instructed the other flight attendants to clean it up. It was only after seeing me continue to shake that she then brought a blanket and made several extremely condescending and rude comments ""now you will be happy yeah?"" as I sat visibly shaking. I wrapped myself in the blanket and she woke me several times to ask me why I wasn't sitting in the correct seat and I told her I would pay but I was clearly unwell and that's why I decided to move. She had such little care for how I was feeling and disregarded the sanctity of the human condition in front of her. Just because I didn't book business class does not mean I am to be treated subhuman and woken several times when I am trying to sleep through the fever. I paid for the seat and requested paracetamol several times, and my request was ignored several times.  This airline had a duty of care towards a really sick passenger and I was treated with contempt and indifference. My complaint to FlyDubai was summarily dismissed and no compensatory effort attempted.",0
"Our experience with China Southern Airlines was very good, our flight C 305 from Guangzhou to Auckland was particularly good. The staff were friendly, polite and willing to assist in service in every way. Our special thanks and appreciation is to cabin staff who served us with refreshments, meals, and extra drinks and coffees we asked for along the way. It made a long and arduous journey memorably pleasant. ",1
"Very bad customer service! I had booked two tickets from Bengaluru to Bhubneshwar for 22nd December, the amount for the same i.e. INR 10630 was deducted from my account but tickets were not confirmed. I spoke to the customer executive of Air India regarding the issue and she said that the ticket has not been booked and I will get refund for the same if I will mail to",0
"I was flying from Budapest to Lisbon and after arriving to the airport I discovered the flight was cancelled without any prior notification, no representative from the airline to explain anything and after waiting at the airport for an hour they informed us it is rescheduled to fly after 12 hours! This airline is known for delays. Do not ever use them! the worst customer service experience ever!",0
"This was a booking with KLM for two passengers made and paid by myself but one passenger cancelled. I was promised a refund against a fee. The refund was never made. I asked various Air France employees if there was anything I could do to solve the situation.  It seems to me that niceties in the cabin are cheap to get, and anyway, those are paid for. When real issues arise, Air France is incapable of solving them, and, indeed, does not care to do so.",0
"Hamilton to Abbotsford via Edmonton. Absolutely horrible customer service. Do not fly with Flair. AVOID AT ALL COSTS. I missed my first leg of this flight and managed to miraculously book a separate flight to make it in time for my connecting flight in Edmonton. I was informed by Flair Airlines that because I missed my first flight, even though there is a 5hr 45min layover in Edmonton my ticket was void. Absolutely abysmal customer service. Incredibly disappointed that they couldn't get me on the flight in Edmonton.",0
Dubai to Istanbul. Awful seats. Not comfortable at all for a 5 hours trip from Dubai to Istanbul. No entertainment and even the chairs are not going back so you can sleep like on any other airlines due to the very small spaces between the chairs. Horrible trip. Not recommended at all.,0
We flew from London to Iceland and on to Orlando May 2014 in Saga Class with a 3 night stop over in Iceland. I require wheelchair assistance. I was given help on and off the planes with a smile. Both flights were on time. The crews were courteous and helpful on both flights. When I got up to go the toilet a crew member came to offer a pull up from my seat. I agree with other reviews that the seats do not meet current business class standards on international flights but they are reasonably comfortable and offer enough recline to stretch out on a long flight. The free stop over in Iceland was a great bonus. Overall Icelandair offers good value for the price paid.,1
"We flew Brisbane to Perth on September 1st to connect with our flight through to Rome with Qatar Airways. We were lucky to fly on one of the updated Qantas A330s, with the new business class modules. I sat in 5A and was impressed with the quality of the new layout which has lie flat beds and a 1x2x1 layout with plenty of room, and standards practically the same as international. The service by flight attendants was first class and very attentive. The food was a selection of Neil Perry dishes with some very fine Australian wines to choose from. It seems Qantas is working hard to improve its domestic business class. I will not hesitate to fly Qantas again.",1
e flew from Vancouver to Kahului on Air Canada Rouge AC1827 and back on AC1828 a week ago. Alas this might be the last time we use this airline as it was the most uncomfortable seating and rudest crew. My back is still hurting after a week and we cancelled a trip to Hawaii that was coming up due to Air Canada Rouge. The crew was as usual arrogant and unprofessional. They decided to turn all the lights on half away through the red eye flight to distribute beverages while everyone was trying to sleep. As for the price there is no difference with mainstream Air Canada. You pay the same for a horrible experience.,0
Sao Paulo to Frankfurt. This is the second time I fly with Latam and I can tell that they are the worst. I was checking my bags peacefully then a very angry lady did a mistake which they took one bag and left the other bag! Then all what she could say was go to the line and do it manually. Again i will have to stay in the long line. I asked her but why? You already took one bag! She said its ok! I told her but its easy just call somebody to fix it I barely finished!,0
"I just got off the phone with Air Transat in Montreal and had to immediately write a review for the outstanding customer service I had been given. I had booked a flight for June from Calgary to London for my mom, however, due to circumstances, my mom was not able to go anymore. I had called Air Transat very unhappy and upset and asked if there was anyway I could get a refund for the flight as it was a lot of money for our sisters being students. I talked to the agent and asked if there was anyway I could get a refund or a little bit back. She was so patient and so so kind, she talked to the supervisor, and when she came back on the call and told me the good news, and that I was approved to get a refund on my ticket. I could not believe the sympathy and compassion they gave me and understood the situation I was in. Thank you so much.",1
Sick to death of flying with this budget airline. Flights are always delayed or cancelled last minute with no alerts sent to their passengers or respect for our time. Carry on weights are pathetic making a big drama over 400grams over weight.,0
"Darwin to London via Kuala Lumpur. We had the first leg of our flight from Darwin cancelled without any explanation or follow up, so we asked for a refund. 9 weeks later and numerous phone calls and emails, we are still waiting. Very quick to take our money for the booking but very slow to refund money for a flight they cancelled! Very poor PR Malaysia Airlines!",0
London to Athens with Aegean Airlines. Polite and easy check in. Efficient boarding with priority given to Business Class. Welcome was with a smile and very courteous crew. Spotless aircraft. Drinks served swiftly followed by excellent meal from a menu with 2 choices of main. Good selection of wines including some award winning Greek ones. Hot towels again served by polite and elegant crew. Landed early. An excellent airline and recommended.,1
"Horrible! Today was the last time I am buying with Tiger! Few weeks ago I was flying from Sydney to Brisbane and had a delay over 3 hours. Ok, sometimes can happen. Today I am flying from Brisbane to Sydney and the flight was cancelled! They moved me to another flight in 3 hours! Cannot believe it. I bought this flight to make sure I am fine for a meeting in Sydney. I am sure I will have some issues when flying back on Saturday, unfortunately bought return flight with this poor airline.",0
I will never fly Spirit again! Don't be fooled by their cheap rates. I can't believe how they nickel and dime you. It would have been cheaper to fly Delta and feel a little more comfort. Spirits new seats give you a little more leg room but are so uncomfortable. Made from formed plastic can't recline and not a whole lot of cushion. When checking the bags in Tampa the lines were long for fast bag drop off. It took an hour to get through that line. The counter person was courteous but complained about working too many hours and just wanted to go home. Flying back into Detroit we ended up waiting for a gate to open for over an hour and half. I don't know why we could not have used another gate temporarily to at least get off the plane. Then the stewardess asked people that were not transferring to let some transfers go first. Well everyone decided they were a transfer because they just wanted off the airplane. Then waiting for our bags was another story! We waited for over an 1 hour and half for the bags. People were getting angry and asking Spirit personnel what going on and all they could say was there were 7 planes arriving all at the same time and then they closed the door. After waiting all this time the bags showed up on another carousel without even notifying anyone. Our ride waited 3 hours for us to get out of the airport. Other carriers were able to get in and get their customers out on a timely basis. Why can't Spirit?,0
"Bangkok to Tokyo. During my boarding of this flight yet to depart, there was two scanner for boarding pass checks and there was two line to scan so I decided to walk the other line which was for business class. However, I was call to the back of the line for economy class.",0
"In a word, brilliant. Typically German but I like that. Efficient and to the point. Aircraft was really clean both inside and out. IFE is by far the best. Excellent choice of films and music. The moving map is by far the best I've seen with 3D visualisations of the aircraft and virtual views from the cockpit and over the wings. Food was good. Service was friendly and regular refreshments. Only gripe was leg room seemed a bit tight. Highly recommended.",1
My family and I used Egyptair from Cairo to New York. As it was a long flight it was a real nightmare. After 5 hours the toilets were very dirty and the cabin crew did not want to clean them. We have a 3 year old son and there was no available entertainment for him at all. The food was very poor. We have used Egyptair a lot for short flights as we used to live in Egypt they were not bad at all. But after our experience we will never use them for a long flight again.,0
Manchester to Kuala Lumpur via Abu Dhabi on New Year's Eve. On boarding dispute over 2 people sitting in wrong seats woman refused to move stewardess did not know how to handle it eventually after unsuccessfully pleading with her to move she told the couple whose seats they were that she would find them somewhere else to sit but they would be apart naturally they refused! Meanwhile nobody else could get past to get to their seats. Service on board was extremely slow we had the wrong menu card. Even though the Cabin Crew were wearing 'Happy new year' hats when we boarded there was only a passing reference to it being 2014 as we passed over Romania. Abu Dhabi airport experience was an awful chaotic shambles. Multiple flights arrived simultaneously and they clearly could not cope with the thousands of passengers in transit. Nobody knew what they were queuing for or even if they were in the right terminal. Airport staff were taking no notice of those who were trying to tell them they would miss their connection if they stayed in the queue luckily we had a 3 hour wait so we were not worried just bemused at the chaos. Security control was a joke only 6 manned and shouting to us to 'leave everything in your bags'. Not looking forward to going back through on the way home. Food on board was nothing special entertainment not brilliant headphones didn't work. Overall not a good experience would not use Etihad again travelled to KL with Emirates last time and there is no comparison. Must say however that landings were excellent hardly a bump.,0
My flight from Montreal to Vienna was delayed and wasn't going to be leaving until the following morning. This caused me to miss my bus from Vienna to Munich which cost over 100 euros. I spent 9 hours in the airport waiting. They didn't do anything but give me a coupon to use with Air Canada. I'm never going to use it as I never want to fly Air Canada again. I'm now on my way home from Vienna and my flights been delayed an hour and a half causing me to miss another ride so I will have to get a hotel for the night in Vancouver as I live 2 hours drive from the airport. Well done again AC.,0
"Beijing to Chiang Mai via Guangzhou. Our flight from Beijing to Guangzhou was delayed for 4 hours due to bad weather condition but the weather in Beijing was cloudy. After we landed in Guangzhou, there were only 30 mins left to the flight to Chiangmai. The staff said we just needed to follow him and catch the flight. He just ran at the front without checking whether anyone had followed him or not! Though we caught the flight. when we landed in Chiangmai. Our bags were still in Guangzhou and we were told that our bags would arrive in Chiangmai the next day! When I called them for some compensation of the loss due to the delayed bags. They said I should have contacted the staff in Chiangmai right after I landed but the chinagmai staff asked me to call China. However the cabin attendants were very attentive and provided rice dumpings for us to celebrate dragon boat festival.",0
Flew Beijing to Copenhagen with Scandinavian Airlines. Seats are uncomfortable and staff are very unfriendly. One free soft drink only even on long haul flights and no extra snacks in addition to the bad meals they served. The inflight entertainment is terrible very old fashioned cannot play movies on demand you just have to hope the movie you want to watch is starting at the right time. Hardly any movies to choose from either.,0
New Orleans to Los Angeles via Houston. So in New Orleans flight was delayed because of weather about 30 mins. Here in Houston over an hour delayed because an attendant hasn't arrived. What an irresponsibility. For 1 person whom is not the Captain we are waiting. Who knows if they delay it more. Bad bad.,0
Great flight with Jetstar Airways from Christchurch to Auckland. Great food and the staff were very friendly. I suppose the only bad thing was a delayed flight. But overall I am happy. Jetstar meets all expectations. One time my partners flight was late and he was given a free voucher.,1
Singapore to Bangkok. Value for money. No fuss smooth online check in. Staff onboard was accommodating and professional. Pleasant short flight. Take off and landing was also stable.,1
Gatwick to Marrakech and back. Bag drop was fast gate was peaceful boarding on time and orderly all staff very pleasant refreshments good and landed on time. Return almost identical just a little late landing after a technical delay taking off. Well worth paying for a quality airline for a 3 hour flight.,1
"Can't expect much for premium economy so the seat, meal and inflight entertainment was fine. What was horrible is the policy to require mask in a 14h flight. What made it worse was the flight was midnight but the counter was only open 2 hours prior, which is normal, but made passengers unable to use lounges. What's the use of paying the additional fee? Also they only opened 2 counters for non Business. Very slow and long 1h wait",0
Delay of more than 12 hours. Rude and unhelpful staff in Moscow lack of any kind of information post service inexistent. On the way back from MAD to BKK first flight got delayed 2.5 hours so when we arrive in SVO connection to BKK had already departed. Instead of giving us a hotel they gave us a boarding pass to Seoul! We arrived to Seoul without any idea of what to do next nobody say anything to us no information. There they gave us a boarding pass to BKK with Korean airlines for 6 hours later. Arrive into Bangkok with more than 12 hours delay they inform us that our bags were still in Moscow. The worst customer service.,0
"Kuwait to Istanbul via Doha, and this was my first flight on Qatar Airways. It was an amazing flight, there was an awesome flight attendant on flight QR241 who was so enthusiastic and wanted to talk with passengers and help them.",1
We flew yesterday and we were absolutely disgusted with the service! Because of a fault in the plane we had to transfer to another aircraft. During which time our bags had to be transferred also. when we finally reached out destination we found that our bags had obviously left put in the rain! Our clothes etc were all very damp! The staff was not helpful at all and didn't communicate the situation very well. Not very satisfactory especially for those with small children. Would not recommend this airline in the future,0
Seattle to Salt Lake City. I had a terrible experience. Delta made me check in my carryon bag and I have had traumatic experiences with this in the past. I was then seated in a row behind my partner when it could have been avoided. Probably just wanted us to pay the extra fee. I am outraged.,0
The seats on United Airlines have a little more leg room than competition. The crew of stewards and stewardesses are very helpful and pleasant. Overall a decent and safe travel experience.,1
"This flight was Emirates back to its very best. Great service from the cabin crew, who were attentive, but also had a great sense of humour and seemed to be genuinely enjoying the flight. A light breakfast was served after departure from Dubai, with fresh fruits and breads. Lunch served about 2 hours before arrival into LHR. My wife and I chose the Fish tahta as a main course. This was roasted Kingfish in spicy rice, really tasty and generous portion. The Emirates Bar is a great feature on the A380 and we enjoyed a cocktail and a laugh and joke with the cabin crew. This really adds to the travel experience and is one of the features which makes travelling with Emirates a pleasant experience.",1
I received an email on the flight day saying my flight is cancelled. I couldn't reach to anybody to talk. Spent hours to manage cancellation. They ruined my day.,0
"Comfortable flight, good selection of entertainment in both English and Bengali, decent leg room, definitely worth paying the 5 USD to get a free seat next to you on a flight that long. Came in just over 13 hours in the air, and was comfortable throughout the entire flight. Food was rather nice too, something I did not expect.",1
"it is the only connection that safes me from driving to Berlin Tegel to fly to Munich, I wanted to use British Midlands from Rostock to Munich. However the first booking I had was outbound 27.7. from Rostock. The takeoff was 2 Hours delayed, the arrival in Munich too. I lost my reservation at the car hire and had to pay double. At the inbound flight on 30.7. we drove to the airplane by bus, where waiting there 20 Minutes in front of the airplane, until bbeing told there is no crew here yet. The actual departure was 3 Hours delayed. Today the filght was cancelled completely with the notice 2 hours before take off. The worst airline I ever used. It feels as if they are one step away from closing down. Unfortunately I have two bookings pending from November. I think I will cancel them on my costs and accept the drive to Berlin Tegel.",0
"Singapore to Hobart via Melbourne. Qantas has just cancelled the flight last minute on day of travel with just an sms notification. Initially i have thought it was a scam sms as I can't find any information in the Qantas website or online ""manage booking"" site. No service at all to assist or even explain what was going on. I had to call relentlessly to get to a dial tone on the hotline and waited for more than an hour before a human answered. This is totally unacceptable and Qantas is not a least bit apologetic. Worst service ever!",0
"Not the airline they used to be. They will cancel your flight just a few hours before take off with no explanation. If you try to rebook, chat or call it will take hours and they will not be honest with you. I doubt they will be around much longer with such terrible service.",0
"First time taking daughter and granddaughter abroad. On the way out child behind was kicking seat and banging tray, but the best was yet to come. On the way back, cabin crew served a couple 6 bottles of wine and then another 3 later on, so we had n woman laughing all the time pounding music from mobile phone and they were never told to switch off when landing! Also the cabin crew were not up to standards of any other airline that I have flown. Jet2 spoiled the first time flying for my daughter and granddaughter. ",0
"London Heathrow to Barcelona. I thought it would be better than a low cost airline, but it is not. In fact it is quite worse, so if you have a cheaper option, do not hesitate to go with them. The flight is full and they say you can only take on board a backpack to put under your seat but not the bag trolley. Rude people and ridiculous rules, a company living in the past century.",0
"Melbourne to Sydney. A family trip to Sydney on the weekend took a turn for the worse when our flight to Sydney on Friday evening was cancelled 3 hours before hand due to operational requirements. We received a text message with our new flight details on the first flight on Saturday. A bit annoyed but seeing there was a huge storm in Sydney that night not their fault, and I was actually impressed with with how quick and efficient they were in notifying us and rebooking our flight. However it all went to custard the next morning. We got up early to catch the 6.45am flight. On route to the airport we checked the flight status at Melbourne Airport and it was listed as cancelled. We rang Tiger Air who confirmed that the flight was still running. Seeing that we didnt received a txt or email from Tiger we assumed all was good. When we got to the airport however the flight was indeed cancelled and the customer service people were absolutely hopeless. We ran to the Qantas service desk where the most lovely and helpful staff managed to get us the last 3 seats on a 8.00am flight. It was expensive as you would imagine. The only positive thing was that the refund process was quick and simple I dont expect a first class experience from a budget airline, however because they dont have a big fleet of aircraft when incidents like this happen they cannot recover quickly enough. I wont be flying TigerAir again",0
Chios to Athens. Nice flight. Economical ticket. All Covid measures applied. Friendly staff. Gave us a treat. Professionalism. Arrived earlier than scheduled. Punctual and always with a smile. Will certainly fly with Olympic Air again.,1
Full marks and much appreciation for a prompt and full refund of our unused flights due to Covid 19 from Paris to Hong Kong and Hong Kong to Sydney. We had a refund in our account just 12 days after we applied which was truly exceptional. So disappointed in our own airline Qantas from whom we are still waiting for a refund on a cancelled flight since first applying in March six months ago! We will definitely use Cathay Pacific in the future because of this experience and you certainly have won our admiration as customers. Thank You.,1
I am a seasoned traveler and have never crossed the Atlantic without free food or water being offered!  A full plane from Boston to Barcelona and not a sip of water offered. When a passenger in front of me asked why he had not been offered a beverage the flight attendant told him he must have been asleep. I was awake and they moved right past me too. The worst cabin service ever! Never fly this airline again.,0
Went to Cuba Feb 11 2014 and returned Feb 18 seat 5b. I was disappointed with the meal service this year. I travel with Sunwing every year and ordered a vegan meal there and back. I was told the vegan meal was not available anymore only vegetarian. The meal I got was disgusting last year and the year before I got a delicious meal of rice with vegetables. I pay a lot of money to fly with them and I had nothing to eat there and back. I will be booking with someone else from now on.,0
Fort Myers  to Rochester. We have flown on Delta twice now. Both times we dealt with cancelled flights and delays due to mechanical problems. The people that work for Delta Air Lines were not helpful. We even got yelled at by the person working at the special services desk. There is no compensation either. We were told we would have to stay till the next day but the hotel would be at our cost. Or we could fly to a different city but the rental car to get home would also be our cost. Don't fly with Delta. I would rather walk!,0
"Amsterdam to Los Angeles and I always love to fly with KLM. Always great service, food is good and a great amount of available beverages. The Boeing 747 in KLM's fleet are old, you can see it in the entertainment system, but the movies and series they offer are great. Overall a great experience.",1
"Worst customer service ever. My luggage was not sent with me. when I arrive at the airport, I am promised that the luggage will be delivered the next day. The next day I get a message that it will be delayed. I call and call, talk to five different customer service people. are promised that they will send it the same day and that they will call back. No one calls me back, no further message or information. Will not travel with KLM again, or recommend KLM to anyone again.",0
Most horrible airline. Rescheduled flight 3 times on the day of departure before finally cancelling it. Had to book an Indigo flight at the last moment for double the price to get back to work. Am really ashamed that the government allows this so called airline to operate in India.,0
"Sloppy flight attendants. These uniforms although meant to be casual, are being worn as just plain sloppy. Worst of all this translated into sloppy service. The food served was awful, the eggs in the morning were inedible. Instead of offering water through the night, the crew sat at the back chatting. Come on Air Canada, I was embarrassed to be a Canadian looking at this sorry bunch. ",0
Flew from Belfast to Keflavik on Easyjet im March 2920. It was a very comfortable flight from a very under utilized airport. Boarding was handled efficiently. We did board via a bridge. Did not buy anything on board as I spent three hours in business lounge in Belfast airport before the flight.,1
"Connecting flight was cancelled while I was in flight. I did not know until I landed. NO explanation given. They rerouted me and arrived 12 hours later. I had to run to get rental car before they closed. They did not reroute my baggage and I did not receive baggage until 4 days later at hotel. Laptop and other valuables were stolen from baggage.  I have reported the theft to them, but have heard nothing!",0
"I missed my connecting flight from Kuala Lumpur to Penang, my own fault, reported my situation and was advised how to book next connecting flight and organise my retrieval of luggage, looking totally confused, I hastily took off to correct my mistake, hopefully. An agent caught up with me and explained it would be quicker and easier for him to organise.  He returned after a short period, having had to run from Gate K to Gate J and return with both my boarding pass and luggage ticket. I was so grateful as he had taken the initiative to go far and beyond his duties to fix my problem. This person should be highly recommended for advancement in the company as he put the company first for customer service which was so appreciated.",1
"A pleasant journey on China Southern Airlines from Guangzhou to London 23 December, and quite satisfied. The dining and entertainment facilities in the cabin impressed me. The flight attendants were professional with good attitude. It was very nice for me, although the Boeing 787 economy seats were not comfortable enough. ",1
"My flight was scheduled to leave at 7.45 to Newark after it was delayed twice, we finally boarded close to 9pm. The staff did not give a reason as to why the flight was delayed and then told me that all other flights to Newark were booked up. ",0
Excellent flight from London Heathrow to Abu Dhabi. Good comfortable flat beds with extremely attentive staff. Food hot and tasty well presented and an abundance of alcoholic drinks if desired. Toilets very clean and attended to extremely frequently. Entertainment was fine and just right for the length of flight 7 hours. I have travelled several times with Qatar and Emirates Etihad are just as good.,1
AC 016 31st March from HKG to Toronto. A very pleasant surprise. The service was outstanding and the attention to details also surprisingly good. I was impressed by the attention to service and the passengers exhibited by the staff and overall Air Canada has certainly improved their intercontinental Business Class product. The seats were very comfortable and this is the first time I have flown the Hong Kong to Toronto route on Air Canada. I usually fly Cathay Pacific or EVA and dollar for dollar Air Canada comes out on top.,1
"Ft Lauderdale to Nassau. I was threatened by the gate attendant to have TSA to remove me from flight for asking why he gave my seats away that I paid extra for, the man lost his mind when he was caught in a lie that he called us for passport verification, we were sitting at the gate for a hour prior to boarding and never was my name called out. After 5 minutes of him yelling at me for asking the question he said I better get on the plane now. After turning and going 30 ' down the ramp he came running after me still waiting to yell at me. There was nothing I could do but stand there in shock of what just happened. So I then turned and continued the rest of the way to the plane. After contacting jetblue I got no apology only offer to refund the up charge for the seats. Still no credit received over 30 days after I sent complaint.",0
The first and last time I fly Rouge. What a disappointment! My previous flights to Honolulu were on Air Canada not Rouge. When I boarded the Rouge jet in December 2014 I noticed there was no inflight entertainment. A 6 hour flight with no inflight entertainment? Air Canada should let travellers know that the 767's they fly to Honolulu have no inflight entertainment. Had I know this I would not have flown Rouge to Honolulu.,0
"Chicago to Louisville. Me and my family missed our flight due to the chaotic and confusing directions not given, but rudely yelled from staff while entering customs. Everyone in customs was confused, the staff was very unfriendly, yelling directions and arguing with people who did not know where to go or what to do making me sympathize with foreigners entering this country for the first time and receiving this type of hospitality. When I approached several different counters in the gating sections to ask for help, several desk employees walked passed me multiple times, with knowledge I was there for help as they were more interested in conversing amongst themselves or being on their phone. This was a terrible experience as the staff alone are all incompetent, rude, and very unhelpful. I refuse to fly with United ever again.",0
"Gatwick to Alicante. Terrible service, absurd charges for carrying an extra tiny bag on the plane, and treated horribly by the staff that was checking the tickets, honestly a complete let down.",0
"This is the worst airline ever, I travel in 2019 and had a bad experience, they broke my suitcase and I got back nothing. I gave them a second chance, they broke 2 brand new suitcases I had just bought in November, I sent whatever they had asked for and I still haven't heard from them. This is very disgusting and bad business.",0
"Kiev to Geneva. Our flight from Kiev was delayed for more than 2 hours. Ground and cabin staff did not even apologize and were rude. Moreover all the passengers including those with children had to wait first at the airport gate which had no heating at all, then in the bus outside for about 30 min with all doors opened in a very cold weather and then in the aircraft! During all this time no information was provided about the reasons of delay and expected time of departure. Absolutely disrespectful to passengers, captain did not apologize, like this is something very normal to them. I strongly do not recommend to fly with UIA and I'm very surprised this company is still allowed to fly in EU.",0
"Run don't walk from any flight on Air Canada Rouge. I've flown it a couple of times and the service, seats and entertainment are terrible. On a recent trip to Cancun from Montreal, there was no water in any of the economy bathrooms. They didn't even provide water bottles for washing your hands. The seats are so close together, you become very intimate with the seat in front of you. There is no entertainment unless you want to rent one of their tables or download an app to watch on yours. ",0
Each time if you are in the front three rows the crew restrict usage of the overhead in preference to the people not already boarded. This usually means that we end up putting their bag further down the plane and the first three bins usually end up not full and people boarding further back of the plane end up using the bins. It is illogical and rude to the passengers already boarded. Now we have to wait to go down the plane to get our bags. It makes now sense. Frontier you have lost me with your ridiculous policy.,0
"Lufthansa made my trip a living hell. I was in for a very important business meeting in Germany. Not only did they lose my luggage with all my valuable things, they made me lose my meetings, because I had nothing to wear. The people from Customer Service and lost luggage where rude, badly mannered. They claim they will pay for clothes, but they really throw difficult procedures which you will end up not paying you for any reimbursement. It is the worst airline in the world, they left me for a week in Europe without any clothes or luggage.",0
"I booked to avoid 10 hour drive to Myrtle Beach. Counting the drive to airport, it took 12 hours on Allegiant. Terrible airline and Huntington Airport. Gave them a 1 rating because zero is not an option.",0
"Colombo to Vancouver via Kunming and Shanghai. Flying with China Eastern has been a nightmare. Initially I had a 12 hour layover and made plans to go out and see the city, the flight was changed without warning, to a 2 hr. layover with an additional stop plans canceled. The initial departing flight was delayed by 2 hours, causing us to miss our connecting flight. The flight attendants ushered us off the plane while trying to ask what we should do. Upon entering immigration, they took our passports and took it upon themselves to have the airline rebook our flights as you can't enter China without an outgoing confirmed reservation. No airline personnel were there to assist, at this point had things been bettter organized we could have made our connection. once through immigration we went to the service desk, where we literally spent 2.5 hours trying to re book our flight. when we asked why it was taking so long the ""customer service agent"" stated ""do not talk please"". When we pushed to speak management we were refused. The staff kept saying they didn't understand English. Once our flight was rebooked they informed us no accommodation would be provided although we will now be in China over 24 hours. The flight crew to the ""customer service agents"" could not care less that this change significantly distrupted our schedule. We spoke with several others on our flight that had the same experience.",0
I travelled from Auckland to Santiago. It was a 12 hrs flight and I received only one meal. No offer of refreshments throughout the flight. All these to arrive in Santiago and find out that my connecting flight to Lima was cancelled. I paid a lot of money and expected good service. Lan did not provide it.,0
"Booking very easy and simple. Follow up correspondence was excellent. Totally hassle free check in. Boarding seamless, flight crew very courteous, efficient and friendly. Overall an excellent experience. Maybe Qantas executives should fly with Thai and learn how customer service should be delivered.",1
"Flew from Stockholm to Athens on Aegean Airlines. Had only cabin baggage so I went straight to the gate. The airplane was at the gate on time, but the boarding was a mess, ending up having a 20 min delay. The cabin was clean and modern. The crew was excellent, carrying out lots of rounds of services. The hot meal was nice and delicious. They also offered 3 rounds of drinks. The captain kept keeping us informed about the flight. Arrived in Athens with a 20 min delay. The only thing I would recommend is to install some sort of IFE apart from the overhead screens. I've flown Aegean a lot of times, and I would certainly choose them again.",1
This was our first experience with Norwegian Air we cannot fault them in any way. We arrived late at Edinburgh Airport for our flight to Copenhagen we were accepted for Check In we were so grateful as we only had a weekend break booked. The plane looked quite new very clean plenty of leg room the Cabin Crew were very nice. Would not hesitate to use them again.,1
"Our flights with Air Transat was Toronto to London, UK and return. Outgoing we were 3 hrs delayed because they waited for a few passengers from Montreal to board our flight, in turn for those waiting, it affected 100s of people and costly for the rest of us who missed our connections, flights, buses, trains etc when we arrived in London. This was an idiotic decision by Transat for a few late people. On our return to Toronto a week later we were 8 hrs delayed, mechanical I believe. However, the pilot and crew told us they couldn't work over their allotted time and diverted our flight to Montreal, so the Toronto passengers had to wait for a new pilot and crew. Instead of getting into Toronto at 3pm, we arrived 11pm. Again, passengers getting in so late, missing connections, flights, buses, trains etc when we arrived. ",0
"We arrived at Oslo airport to receive an email saying our flight had been cancelled, went to the desk where they had no reason why. Was told we had to fly to Stockholm and wait for a connecting flight to London. What should of been an 2 hour flight turned into a 4 hour flight plus hours of hanging around airports. Oslo airport at 11.30 got into London Airport at 5.40. First and last time using SAS Scandinavian.",0
"Manchester to Stockholm. Checking in online there was a fault and the App did not indicate what is was which caused some frustrating attempts to do it. After that everything went smoothly, they don't charge for bikes which is refreshing but they want you to specify that you have a bike in your bag. Probably so they can take more care of it. No food on the flight but coffee and tea provided. No entertainment on flight, well it was only 2 hours. No reclining seats but plenty of legroom. Enjoyable flight.",1
On boarding a flight from Tampa I was shocked to find that what this airline calls business class consists of placing you in an economy sized seat with standard leg room. The only extra feature was that an empty seat was left between A and C. I fly business class largely to acquire a larger and more comfortable seat. With Rouge you pay for business class seats but you do not get them. Further you are not warned of this when you book your flight. The information provided indicates no difference between Rouge business class seats and regular business class seats. This is a deceptive practice and Air Canada should be required to post proper information on this matter. In any case I will never consider using Rouge again.,0
Vienna to Toronto. As a Star Alliance Gold member I expect to be treated better but instead worse than anybody else. Not only was I seated at row 30 and on an aisle seat which the airline claimed it was the best they could do but also they did not wait for my connection which was late not helped in any way to make things at least inconvenient as possible. Also they should be more precise with their information about how many luggage are allowed without charge for Star Alliance Gold members and not charge them when they claim 2 are allowed when in reality none are allowed. This is called false advertising.,0
"We agree wholeheartedly with the last reviewer after an absolutely appalling flight from Hong Kong to London recently! We travel frequently and have come to expect economy seats that are cramped but this flight took it to a whole new level of discomfort with no legroom whatsoever and seats so close that it epitomised that saying ""in cattle class"". The service was non existent and not once in the 12 hour flight did the toilets get cleaned and with a plane full of people they became unhygienic and disgraceful very quickly and stayed that way. We actually booked from NZ to London with Air New Zealand but were code shared on VA from Hong Kong after a stopover there so were disappointed that our national carrier aligns itself with this airline. We would strongly advise you to heed the reviews here and on other sites and not fly with VA we certainly will be steering well clear of them in the future!",0
"Flew United Airlines from Houston to Los Angeles. The United customer service has proven to be unfriendly. I have received better support from ex continental employees than those of United and they are getting harder to locate as the new hires take on the persona of the sardine flight company that overlooks all of its flights. In calling to try and find a set of seats that we could sit together the only seats that they could find were at row 37 where we were split between row 8 and 25 previously. They also then wanted over 100 dollars to upgrade one seat where I was offered nothing for moving backwards in seating. They also offer no support for the consumer nor do they recognize those that have traveled most of their adult life, if it were not for all of the continental lifetime miles I would chose an alternative airline company to fly and if Alaska Airlines had a better connection out of Houston it would probably be the best of those I have flown recently.",0
I flew a return Lufthansa flight to Frankfurt from London City. Well a perfect flight despite leaving London City 30 minutes late and arriving into Frankfurt 5 minutes late. The flight was not a full flight and there was room to spread out both on the outward and return legs. The food was nice and tasty and there was excellent service. The communication from the cockpit and cabin was clear and concise. For some reason I had an upgrade on both flights which I did enjoy.,1
"Flew on Thursday 9th Jan 2020 from Singapore to Brisbane. Endured some turbulence flying out of Singapore for a few hours. I became nauseated and uncomfortable. Staff were very kind and helpful making sure I was looked after. Checked on me numerous times, throughout the flight. Very impressed with the cabin crew and would recommend flying with this airline in the future.",1
"Austrian airlines have cancelled my tickets without providing me any information or update about this. I have discovered this when trying to check in. I was able to buy exact same tickets and even same seats, just 300 dollars more expensive. When contacted them, they only provided me with vague excuses and no compensation.",0
"You already feel that you are in Thailand with the warm welcome of the cabin crew. Also the way they help parents with kids, Thai crew did it with their hearts. I always fly with Thai airways whenever I have a chance to. Thank you for a wonderful flight.",1
Sydney to New York via Los Angeles with Qantas in Business. A great flight. Qantas service is really top class. A380 is a mighty craft but the 747 from LAX to JFK was equally as good. The bed was lay flat and comfortable. The food and alcohol was excellent. The crew were marvellous.,1
"I think it's worth the attention to not fall in the ambush of GOL website and contract the service of travel assistance by mistake. By the time you make payment a check box appears asking if you ""confirms the service engagement?"". At no time is described ""confirms the travel assistance service engagement?"". Moreover it is not broken the price of the service alone but has added to the value of the ticket. You can only identify the service conditions when you click on link and another window opens. I always buy passage on the site and this time I ended up contracting the travel assistance services by mistake.",0
"Yesterday before my flight i got so much pain in my stomach. I had no medicine to help me or calm me down. At the plane when I explained how I felt, I got an instant interest and help from the cabin crew. They provided me with water and medicine. Afterwards they came to me a couple of times to make sure I feel okay. I am very grateful for the service i got from them. Thank you!",1
"London to Toronto flight was delayed first because bathroom sinks were not working which is causing us to miss our time slot for departure, and eventually made us miss our connection.",0
"New York to Miami. If you want to pay for American Airlines and get Spirit Airlines service thats the only way you should travel with them. Delayed at every single flight no exception between 1 and 3 hours, no water no snacks, no going to the bathroom, just sit strapped in your seat until you get to depart, if you ever find out since the crew does not communicate with the passengers. This is my last trip with American Airlines, will change my miles membership and credit cards too, this is a absolute no no company to travel with. Sadly they have been decreasing quality since past 4 years, but the delays are just too frustrating.",0
"Budapest to London City with LOT Polish Airlines. Dream flight. Boarded quickly, less than half full, immaculate and really comfy aircraft, lovely crew, actually had nice food and drink. Landed on time, on DLR within 10 minutes of touch down. Cost the same as Ryanair from Stansted on the way out to Budapest.",1
"This is the first time i used Finnair but it is also the last time. They have very bad customer service. My flight was from Oslo to Los Angeles. At Oslo airport, they dont have self service bag drop like other airlines, instead, they had only 1 person working at the baggage checkin, thus, there was such a long queue. I arrived at the airport 2 hours before the departure time because i thought it was enough, just like other times when i used other airlines. But the queue was so long that when i had my bag checked in it was already the departure time, meaning i wait in the line for 2 hours. I was so worried and people waiting at the same time with me also were frustrated. But they waited for us to board. But i had only 1 hr transfer time at Helsinki to take the flight to LAX, so when i landed in Helsinki it was 16.30 instead of 15.30 as schedule. My next flight departure time was 16.30 so i definitely would miss it. Lucky for me that the flight from HEL to LAX was also delayed because of bad weather so i could catch it, but they lost my baggage. I filled in the form at the airport to report the lost bag, they did not give me a report reference number so i cannot track where is my bag, then i contacted them by chatting but they only allow me to chat with this stupid chatbot that cannot help me anything, i tried to call them with the number on their website but it said the number is not valid. It is very frustrating with their bad customer service. I will never use this airline again. When i am writing this, i still don't know where is my bag and how can i contact them, they don't contact me at all",0
"Montreal to Dubai via Toronto. I almost missed the flight as they did not show the flight as boarding, nor late. The lady at the gate said often their flights do not indicate status. Very odd for a modern airport. Last time I came to Canada, I did miss a connection as the staff told everyone to go to the wrong customs clearance after a snow storm delay.",0
Denver to Phoenix. Worst airline ever. Staff members are rude. They lost my bag. They wanted to charge me for a bag that I had already purchased. Horrible customer service. Never flying with them again.,0
"After delay of hour and half They boarded us, a full flight. After they dimmed the lights and flights attendants took their seats, they announced that we needed to get off the plane because they didn't have enough fuel with full capacity passengers. After another half hour waiting off the plane, they announced that if the don't get 60 volunteers, that they will start boarding and once they reach weight capacity, the remaining people get involuntarily bumped with no compensation but next flight out which was 24 hours away. Horrible situation in every way.",0
"Do not fly this airline unless you absolutely have to. On a positive note, the plane was fairly comfortable. If you have a problem with your flight, you will not be able to resolve it and you will just lose money and be angry like I am. There are a million problems with the website and customer service is completely non existent at this company. Try calling their US number before you decide if fly if you're an American citizen, it just hangs up on me right away. The Wingo desk at Bogota airport is also very poorly trained and unfamiliar with many rules. As you know, there are always small issue that arise when flying, and it's too risky to fly Wingo.",0
"Tibilisi to Amsterdam. This is one of the most shocking, scummy and poor airline I have ever flown with and I travel a lot! We booked flights with this airline to Armenia and then we had connection with this airline on our way back to UK via Amsterdam. They didn't informed us about cancellation and they didn't care to apologies or even show any curtest towards their customers. Very unreliable changing times of their flights all the time so please if anyone buy flights with this airline always check few days before flying. As an airline they are unresponsive and will refuse to pay money back for cancellation or just lie to your face about it. Their English is extremely poor so is Russian so I'm not sure what other language you can communicate with this airline apart from Georgian. The food on the plane was disgusting. And we haven't received refreshments at all not talking about the water which you would think would be basic human right. The entertainment on a long flights is non existent and staff does not bother. On our flight back stewardess was sleeping all the way to Amsterdam at the back and if anyone was trying to use toilet at the back of the plane other stewardess was barking at people and could not be more rude and annoyed with people actually being on the plane.",0
"Dubai to Toronto via Istanbul with Turkish Airlines. One of the worst experiences of my life. Delayed flight from Dubai for 7 hours, then a flight delay for two days in Istanbul, and in the end didn't get any checked baggage. Will never fly this incompetent airline.",0
Seattle to Shanghai. The airplane is relatively new. The inflight entertainment contains a wide range of movies from different countries and also the lastest songs. The crew were very nice and friendly. I would not say they have great food on the plane but I wouldn't complain too much with an economy class ticket. But they do have a large selection of beverages and offer different types of wines.,1
"Multiple delayed flights. Hours long waits in planes and airports. Flight from Detroit left when we were on the ground ready to make connecting flight. They knew we were on the ground. Left anyway leaving us with several hour wait. Staff unhelpful helping us to get off the plane first knowing we had 26 minutes to get on the connecting flight. Unable to get off plane in Minneapolis because another plane used our unloading platform knowing full well we were on time, even early. Only one info desk to assist with making new flight arrangements. Staff slow. At least 30 people in line ahead of us. Waited over an hour. Cleaning crews late making boarding late. Have been at airports and on planes since 11 this morning. It is now midnight with no end in sight. Hired transport company left us after making 2 trips to airport and waiting for over an hour.",0
We have just returned from visiting friends for a month in Orlando. We flew from Glasgow. The whole experience was excellent. My wife is disabled and was well looked after. The food was yummy the flight attendants both ways were helpful polite and attentive. Both flights were faultless despite a measure of turbulence on both. Well done Virgin hope to go with you next year!,1
Travelled to Palma in new BA 'sardine' business class. Uncomfortable seats with Ryanair leg room so knees sticking into passenger in front. Poor service. Despite checking in 90 minutes before departure left 2 bags behind which were not delivered for more than 24 hours later causing misery. Other passengers also shocked at conditions. If this is the new look business class BA then better off with Easyjet or Ryanair much cheaper and service could not be much worse.,0
Flew 4 legs from Santiago to Iguazu. First one cancelled and we took next flight 3 hours later. Second one was delayed. The same with third flight. The last one also delayed before we could board and once onboard we had to stay sitting in the plane at Buenos Aires airport for more than an hour in a very warm day.,0
"McAllen TX to Houston TX with United Airlines. The flight attendant on my flight this afternoon was extremely kind and very good. As I was boarding the flight she offered me a seat belt extention without me having to ask. I found this nice because it's embarrassing sometimes when you have to ask for one. When serving drinks she called everyone by name which I've never had happen before. She also helped by lifting the arm on my seat to make me more comfortable.  I just found her really friendly and attentive which was nice since we had several ""busy"" businessmen on our flight who I thought were kind of rude. But kudos to the flight attendant on a great job.",1
"Hanoi to Singapore. Rubbish airline that always delays the flights, does not announce delays and has terrible customer service. Avoid even if given for free.",0
"Madrid to Stockholm. Ground staff really friendly, very fast boarding and on time take off. The aircraft was very clean and nice. Onboard crew with good customer service and polite.",1
"Flew this airlines from Minneapolis to San Diego in August. The staff at the MSP check in desk were very happy. We got to the gate and boarded in no time. A very smooth and planed process. Once in the air, the flight attendants came around twice during the flight. I just got water but they were selling other snack items and free beverages. Landed on time and got our baggage lickety split.",1
"I flew from Istanbul to Berlin in July 2015. The seat was very uncomfortable. Water was not free, they charge 3 Euros for a small bottle. The staff could hardly speak any English. On top of all that, both pieces of my luggage was delayed 4 days. ",0
London to Budapest via Munich. Lufthansa just ruined our Xmas! First leg delayed and they rebooked us for a flight almost a complete day after the original  was supposed to fly out. Now dumped to the airport waiting for a bus that supposed to take us to an hotel.,0
"Bad service. My flight was delayed by over 5 hours. I missed my connection in Amsterdam and they offered me another flight after waiting 12 hours. In total 8 hours of travel for 18 hours of waiting, make your considerations.",0
Luton to Venice via Paris. Very convenient mobile check in and boarding pass. Convenient baggage drop and boarding in the airport. Ground staff and flight attendants are polite and friendly. Most importantly the flights arrived early to the destination. Comfortable for the price I have paid for.,1
I recently travelled with Air Asia X from Sydney to KL return. Both flights I was meet with bubbly and friendly flight attendants. Whilst on board the service continued with great food. The plane was clean and very spacious for a low cost airline. I also travelled with a bike on this journey with some airlines this can prove to be a bit of a painful task however this process was swift and handled better than some high class airlines in Australia. Coming home from KL I decided to ride in the quiet zone this is such a great idea and was met with all thumbs up from me as I was able to enjoy a lengthy nap on the red eye flight! Overall a great airline can't wait to head back over to Malaysia with Air Asia X in the future.,1
Orlando to LaGuardia round trip. Flight left late by 15 mins but still got us to NY 20 mins ahead of original time. Service was great friendly hosts and entertainment was excellent with my own TV.,1
Mumbai to Hubli. Spicejet counter staff is very irresponsible. Laptop bag is allowed extra in all airlines. But Spicejet airline counts laptop weight in baggage. Also overall service is very poor.,0
"Destin to Knoxville. I sat at the airport for more than 7 hours thanks to multiple delays. The Allegiant employees at the airport were not helpful at all. Paid extra for a seat selection and when we were able to board the plane they told us it was open seating. Not to mention, they downgraded to a smaller plane and crammed adults and children into seats. I will not be flying Allegiant again. I will pay the extra money to fly with another airline. I will be calling Allegiant for a reimbursement for the money I spent on my seat. Do not fly this airline.",0
"Kuwait to Toronto return via Amsterdam. In July 2017 I found a good deal with KLM and went for it.  I was not able to check online and get my free preferred aisle seat. My luggage was not delivered in Toronto. I received it 24hrs later with items broken. Amsterdam to Toronto flight entertainment system was broken in the whole plane. Every time I called the call center I was on hold for approximately 1 hour. When I emailed them with my complaint about check in I received a reply after 3 weeks stating  ""please ask one of our agent at the check in counter to help you"". Today is my flight from Toronto back to Kuwait and I was not able to check in online again, receiving this message ""unfortunately, you can not check in with this booking. please check in at the airport desk"".  Called the customer service and after 1 hour hold this was their answer ""sorry, we dont know why this is happening, please check in at the airport.""",0
"Being kind they are the worst airline I have ever ""flown."" They said that out flight would be delayed because they could not find a plane and then they strung us along found a plane boarded us deplaned us and finally canceled the flight. The representatives at the service desk were so rude and did not seem like they wanted to help me at all. They treated me like a kid! I am still trying to decide if I want to rebook my flight with them or just eat the cost and fly with a real airline. The tickets may be cheap buy they nickel and dime the hell out of you. Also when we boarded there was not enough leg room for me a man at 6ft. It was so cramped. I think they try to cram as many people on the plane to make up for the cheap airfare. Don't waste your money go and spend it with a real airline like United American or yes even Delta.",0
"Check in was fine, no time for the lounge at Brisbane. The first sector was perfect, wonderful crew, great food and wine. Called by name by all crew including inflight service manager on departure. Auckland lounge was full and had plenty of food and drink variety. SFO flight left on time and arrived early. Crew not as warm as previous however food and wine was better than most restaurants. Meals were surprisingly good, especially the Michael Meredith designed menu items. Bed was extremely comfortable. IFE good. Overall was as good as business class gets, was in a cab leaving SFO airport within 30 minutes of landing and 15 minutes ahead of scheduled arrival. Other than the second crew being more jaded than the first this was as good as any business class that we have ever flown on.",1
AC1752 July 31 2014 and AC1753 Aug 7 2014. I have never been so disappointed by an airline! I paid what I thought was business class and found it to be cattle class. Nothing and I mean nothing provided. I will avoid Air Canada vacations if this is their primary carrier! I now have to book a trip to San Diego . Last time it was air Canada and it was business class. Now they dump it to Rouge and they have the nerve to call this business class? Same price without any service. They should be ashamed to call this anything but cattle air. Bring drinks and real food with you! Just fly with them once and you will see!,0
"A great experience, amazing flight attendants on both flights. Flights on time a lot of positive energy.. As a 10 year plus loyal customer that's our only airline.",1
"My family and I have been looking forward to going on vacation for two years now! We are stuck at Kennedy Airport! We were supposed to fly out hours ago! We were informed that they didn't have a pilot! They have no answers to any of our questions! We have know idea when we will be leaving or even worse, the flight may be cancelled. This is not the first time I had an issue with JetBlue. I will never fly JetBlue again and I do not recommend this airline to anyone!",0
A fabulous experience on the MAS A380. Flew them on the outbound evening flight from KUL to LHR. Service was immaculate and the cabin crew on the upper deck economy class were attentive but were motivated and friendly. The flight was only half full so passengers were offered seats on the lower deck if they required it. Food was alright although it has dropped over the past year. The highlight of my flight were cabin crew. I hope the A380 continue to operate this route into Terminal 4.,1
"Dubai to Kuwait. The seats are too small and narrow. I found out too late that fly dubai operate to Sheikh Saad Al Abdallah General Aviation Terminal and not Kuwait Airport, so when they landed I thought we landed at Kuwait airport and my husband was on his way to pick me up from Kuwait airport. I got stuck at flydubai's airport and then had to use their taxi to get out of their airport. They should notify customers that they have their own airport so that travelers can arrange to pick up the traveler from that airport.",0
"Delayed at stop off in Africa and was on the ground in the plane for over 3 hrs. No food or water was offered to any passengers. No info was briefed on why the delay. The worst flight I have ever been on, unfriendly staff, leading to almost missing connecting flight in France. Managed to get connecting flight but baggage never made it. Got back to UK and told air France that I needed my baggage the next day as I was due to fly again 2 days after landing. I had a text from them saying they would only deliver baggage a day after I am due to fly. Called up to challenge delivery time and the staff member in the baggage department was the most unhelpful, rude person. All in all. I would recommend staying as far away from Air France. Still don't have my bags or an answer on when I'm getting them.",0
"Shenyang to New York via Guangzhou. It was a satisfying travel with China Southern Air in general. The food provided was well served and the crew members were very considerable and helpful. They made sure that my violin case was placed safely and took it out for me in advance when I'm leaving the aircraft. They provided a pouch that contains a eye blinder, earplugs, small toothbrush and toothpaste for each customer. However, there was no wifi connection available in the cabin, which may cause some inconveniences to some customers. The second one, which I think is particular to CSA, is that I had to check my luggage again in JFK since I am transferring to CLE afterwards. I didn't have to do this when I was traveling with Air China and Air Canada before.",1
"Bangkok to Munich. Next time another airline. The service is getting very poor. Just one drink each meal, no extra drinks. I'm 192 cm. Get at almost every airline emergency seat. Thai Airways want now 3100 baht almost 100 euros extra. Flight was much more than other airlines and now have less of what you get. I was flying 5 time a year with Thai Airways. In total 15 years. Next time I will book with another airline, they not only save money.",0
"After booking my direct LAM Mozambique flight to Inhambane from Johannesburg  Airport together with my accommodation and connecting flight from Cape Town, LAM cancels my direct flights. As a result I lose my connecting flight back home. They don't care, so don't fly LAM. Don't get travel Insurance because they don't pay. ",0
"This is the second time I took this Spirit Airlines flight to go from San Jose to Orlando via Fort Lauderdale, and the second time I lost my connection on FLL to MCO. So this is not an exception but the norm. This time, Spirit offers me only 2 options, stay the whole night on FLL or refund, not hotel was offered on FLL, so I have to expend more money than expected. Returning back, again, connection was lost and not help was given. Our baggage was lost and nobody on the airline since to know what was going on with our baggage. Finally we need to drove to FLL to pick up them. Definitely, we felt frustrated and Spirit did not care about us. The refund happened like a week after, fortunately we were able to afford to rent a car and drive, if not we would have to spend more than a day on the airport. This is the last time I buy a ticket to Spirit, it is by far the worst airline that I have used.",0
"No delays to or from Puerto Vallarta. Unlike Sunwing the trip before. So you don't get a meal free, but you get much better service. We have flown with WestJet on three other flights to Mexico, only one time was there a delay, but we were given a food voucher and kept up to date,unlike SW. Do think they should make everyone put carry ons in the sizers like Air Canada is doing! We will continue to use WestJet.",1
Flew from Toronto to San Jose CR via Houston. Trying to leave YYZ Air Canada could not provide more than one person at the gate and then did not have a flight crew available. The delays were not notified in advance and we could not cancel hotel reservations. We missed connecting flight in Houston but were informed that United was holding flight for us. When we arrived at United counter they informed us that they told AC that flight was not held so we returned to AC counter only to find it closed. We then went looking for baggage and were told that the baggage was never included on flight out and then hung up on us. We have now spent five days waiting for baggage with no information provided to us or partner carriers very unusual. Typical response is apology with no further information or update nor return call of any sort. Complete incompetence exhibited by AC throughout this process and direct and outright lies in regards to continued correspondence with the firm. I will never fly with this airline again.,0
"This was my first experience with GoAir, and this turned out to be my worst experience of all the flights I've been on. First of all, flight G8 176 which I was traveling on was 6 hours delayed. Then, the ground staff did not update it before time, everybody had to sleep at the airport. They were not even telling the customers whether the flight would get cancelled or further delayed, there was serious lack of management. The authorities tried hiding to prevent queries. When I finally boarded the flight after staying awake all night, the facilities were disgraceful. The air hostesses did not care to greet or comfort the customers, my seat was stiff and it was not able to recline. I had to sit straight the entire time. Overall, a disgraceful and disappointing experience. I would never recommend anybody travel with GoAir no matter how much pocket friendly offers they present.",0
"Manila to Bangalore via Singapore. As usual, exceptional service by the crew. Comfortable flights with the flight attendants always attending to your request. The only hitch was the sound on my assigned seat on the first leg of this flight, because it did not work properly.",1
Istanbul to Diyarbakir. Anadolujet canceled my flight with no reason. It took more than 5 months to get my money back. There were 3 passengers in a PNR which I paid all of them by myself. They gave 3 different return codes and told me that each passenger has to go to the ticket office individually to be able to get the money back.,0
"Flew Frontier Airlines from Salt Lake City to San Antonio. Terrible company. Never flying with them again. My ticket price nearly doubled by the time I had paid for a carry on, checked bag and my seat. I needed to switch my flight to next Sunday and it is cheaper for me to fly Delta and repay for baggage than to switch a flight. Absolutely ridiculous, they got this customer for one flight but will never have him fly with them again.",0
"I cannot stress enough how absolutely awful this flight experience was. Not only was the air conditioning broken but the flight was delayed. Instead of deplaning, United decided it was best to keep all passengers aboard while temperatures reached upwards of 100 degrees within the cabin. We were stuck on the plane for an hour all doors closed and no air while still at the gate. Will never be flying United ever again! If you care about you health, safety, comfort do not fly United.",0
"Jakarta to Pangkal Pinang return. Both flights are awesome. I never had a bad experience with Garuda Indonesia. To be honest, their economy class is already awesome, but if you have extra money,  try the business class.",1
"Highlight the friendliness of the company, the good price ratio, mainly on domestic flights and the customer service that for me is very important to talk to people and not machines. It does not charge hand luggage, it allows you to check it in for free and if you are a priority you can take it in the cabin. I recommend it to my friends.",1
"Completely disappointed and frustrated! Would not recommend to anyone, they delayed our flight about 10 minutes after we were supposed to have already been boarded and supplied no reasoning as to why. They then gave a new estimated time for boarding and also delayed that time after they had us line up for a plane that had only just landed filled with people from its previous flight, we waited in line for 30 mins before being told our flight was then delayed again due to ""engineering problems""! Outraged is all I can say the staff at the gates were also extremely rude about how much longer it would take before we could board. Appaling company and staff, will never use Tigerair Australia again and I recommend that you dont either!",0
"Penang to Singapore. A nice regional airline that shares the relative same standards or at least approach as its big sister, Singapore airlines. Cabin staff speedy and attentive. A small breakfast pastry and fruit with coffee served on a short hope one hour flight. Captain kept us updated particularly for those with short connecting windows. Planes a bit old and shabby but apparently large investment coming soon to this small airline.",1
Before I went to the airport I checked my Sunwing flight online and it was supposed to be on time. All other flights were on time but flight WG622 to Cuba on January 16. Weather that day was perfect sunny and no snow for days. Sunwing did not warn people about the delay and there was no reason for the delay! It's my fifth time to Cuba by Sunwing.,0
Melbourne to Newcastle. My 8pm flight was cancelled without providing sufficient explanation. They refused to give me a flight the following morning. I had to fly into Sydney airport 2.5 hours drive away. This level of service is unacceptable.,0
Be very careful when booking flights through this carrier. If you happen to cancel the tickets due to unexpected reasons you will not get your funds back. I have been waiting for almost 31 days now and the cost of the tickets around 3000 USD is not being refunded by Air India. None of their call center folks will give a response. All call center employees will direct you to ecommerce.airindia email id. No response will come form that ID. How can one keep funds with them for services not provided.,0
"Bangkok to Hong Kong. The flight attendants were the worst I have experienced in Business Class. I felt they were so unhappy about the job, and about to walk out of the position. On the other flight from Hong Kong to Bangkok in Economy, the flight is half full, still the service is way below. The seat is old, I can felt the iron under my ass.  I remembered Emirates used to be really good years ago.",0
"We were booked direct from Bozeman, MT, to Houston, TX, on the same physical plane with the same flight number, but with a brief stop in Denver. We arrived at Denver. No one told us the plane needed maintenance and that we needed to deplane and reboard. We deduced this from the complete deplaning of passengers and, when we asked about the circumstances, were treated by SW employees like complete idiots. We managed to barely make our connecting flight and then board. I sat directly over the baggage loading bay and saw all the transfer bags, which did not include ours. My wife mentioned this to the flight and gate crew. She was, literally, verbally assaulted and told to mind her own business and shut up. Of course, we arrived in Houston without our luggage, which somehow ended up in Dallas. Our luggage finally made it to Houston airport at 2 pm the next day, after which the people contracted to deliver our luggage unloaded it at the wrong hotel. It is 24 hours later, we still haven't got our luggage, comforted only by the knowledge that it is somewhere in Houston, with indeterminate wait times on the phone trying to connect with a human being. Southwest Airlines is a caricature of a budget airline that specializes in cutting corners and offering horrific service.",0
"Just such a terrible and dysfunctional airline starting with customer service. The app is terrible, service has no interest in being of service, business class is nothing of the sort. Stay away.",0
Abbotsford to Winnipeg. I made a mistake while booking a flight and paid for checked luggage for two of us. I immediately messaged Swoop to rectify my error but got no response. I messaged again but two hours later no response. The next day I messaged again but no response. The next day I emailed and messaged with no response and then I called and waited just over an hour to have my call answered. When I told the person about the situation they talked to someone and got back to me saying that it was not possible to refund me. It might have been possible if I had contacted them within 24 hours but now was too late. I tried to speak to a manager but was not given that option. When I said that no one had returned my numerous messages or email the response was that they had been very busy and could not get back to everyone in a timely manner. I asked if eventually I would get a response and was assured that eventually my message would be responded to. When I said that if I had been able to speak to someone right after I had made the mistake it would have been helpful because I could have taken care of rebooking my flights. I assumed that that given the mistake and given that I had messaged to cancel the baggage right after I booked the flight that it would be reasonable to refund the baggage payment. I was told there was nothing that could be done and I should have read the conditions. I am not flying with Swoop again.,0
6 hours delay from Auckland to Buenos Aires and 5 hours delay from Buenos Aires to Auckland. Food was not good the seats were uncomfortable and the TV system rubbish. Staff were not friendly with little customer service skills.,0
"By far the worst airline, compared to them Spirit is a 10. Before spend you money and booking with them you should think twice. Sat in the airport for over 6 hours with them lying about a weather delay while watching other airlines take off.",0
"Brisbane to Sydney on December 10. Great service, value for money. Flight was on time, craft was new and clean, service was efficient and professional. Meal was better than expected. A pleasant change when comparing to another low cost airline I was using during my stay in Australia. Next time, I would choose Jetstar for my national flights in Australia.",1
Smooth faultless 2 hour flight with Ryanair from CCF to JLA friendly cabin crew more importantly on time. Pretty much what you'd expect from Ryanair really.,1
"Stockholm to London. Worst business class flight I have flown. Split seating for myself and my wife because apparently they were overbooked. The meal was inedible for me, and was the worst airline meal I have been served.",0
"Thanks to the ground service staff of Guangzhou Baiyun Airport. Without their assistance and help, the plan of going abroad this time could not be completed. The two made dozens of phone calls to communicate with colleagues about the ticket issues, and then rushed to the security checkpoints at the airport with us to overcome all difficulties to help us get through the security check and board the plane.",1
After a 24 hour delay during which time we were not kept informed of what was happening we board another plane. The new plane sits on the tarmac 45 minutes past take off time and only then the pilot informs us there appears to be a problem with the plane so the plane returns to the gate. There are no apologies there is no information and it seems total indifference to people like myself who will miss their connection resulting in a further 8 hour delay. Service is zero professionalism is zero however the aircrew do appear to be putting in a lot of effort to avoid passing among the passengers or making eye contact. Flight 9268 to Chicago.,0
"Discount airways and discount experience. We have flown jetblue on two different trips once in 2020 and again in 2021. Nothing is right .. the app does not work as it should, we cannot get boarding passes after checking in, it has been so screwed up, we've had the counter agent call a regional supervisor to override system errors. The onboard experience is uncomfortable and everything is an upcharge. The different terminal experiences reinforce my ""never again"" .. dirty, overcrowded, loud, miserable.",0
I booked business class seats for my daughter and elderly father to travel Sydney to Frankfurt via Taipei. They could not have been happier with the service provided including wheelchair assistance at Taipei and Frankfurt airports. Food very good but most impressive was the attention care and respect shown by staff towards my 88 year old father.,1
"Abu Dhabi to Tokyo. My last experience with Etihad is a nightmare. I bought a flight with them to Tokyo Narita more than a month earlier than the travel date. I arrived at the airport 3 hours before the flight departure. Still, I was not allowed boarding because of overbooking? I was not given any explanation or whatsoever for I why could not fly despite having a confirmed ticket and having arrived 3 hours before departure! what kind of service is this? I cannot trust this company anymore. Because of them, I missed an important conference. I was given a ridiculous compensation of 300USD which sounds like a joke. I do not recommend this company to anyone, especially if you are traveling for business. They are not reliable anymore and they have zero respect for customers.",0
"Muscat to London via Doha. It is one of the best airlines, if not the best. I have been using this airline for my travels and not thinking a second to change it. The relationship they make with their customers is incomparable and their service standards are unmatchable.",1
My husband and I flew from FT. Lauderdale to San Juan this past weekend. The flight left on time and was fine! True this flight is only 2.5 hrs long if you are on longer flights the seats are tight. We have used our credit card for free spirit flights we've gone to L.A. twice to N.Y and now to P.R. Bring snacks reading material a deck of cards anything because there is no entertainment but for the cheap fares we'll make the sacrifice.,1
"I booked a flight from Salt Lake City to Long Beach with one stop in Phoenix before getting home. I received a call from American Airlines Customer Service advising me the plane to Long Beach was canceled until tomorrow morning, but would comp my hotel, taxi, dinner and breakfast for the inconvenience. I get to Phoenix and the CSR can't give me anything and has no idea what I'm taking about. Now they are saying they cant help me. My 70 year old mother in law slept in a airport terminal for over 10 hours with nothing because she thought she was going to be taken care of. American Airlines is a bunch of crooks.",0
Air Canada did not help my mom that supposed to go on wheelchair when she was getting out of the plane from her flight Calgary to Vancouver. Because of this she walked long distance and got lost in the airport because she was a first time flyer. She developed edema in her legs when she got home and her legs was painful. She said she showed her boarding pass to the crews and asked but they said wheelchair wasn't noted on the boarding pass. I asked this matter to the ground crew when he hand me the boarding pass and he said its already in the system. But to the crew who don't see it in the boarding pass even if costumer ask will don't mind it. The law state that whoever identify themselves who needs wheelchair should be given. Air Canada was irresponsible and i was so disappointed.,0
Wedding party going to Grand Bahia Principe Mexico from Calgary April 9 2014 was a smooth trip looked to be a newer plane the flight attendants appeared to be a bit frazzled and in a hurry. I had to ask frequently for water and a possible newspaper to which I never received. The trip back to Calgary April 16 2014 was also a smooth flight. The flight attendants were an excellent group of attentive professionals with charismatic humour and precision service.,1
The staff were extremely condescending. Also they charge for carry on bags so the flight price is lip service. They also have a 100 dollar change fee which is just outrageous compared to other companies flexibility. I will never waste my money here again and I recommend you do not.,0
I flew Singapore Airlines for the first time ever last August. Since then I have flown another 2 times to Shanghai return from Brisbane. I can not fault them. The food service and seats are great. The planes between Brisbane and Shanghai are always full but the service is never lacking. The A380 between Shanghai and Singapore is great as well when I select the exit row upstairs. I will never fly another airline to China again.,1
"Kiev Zhuliany to Cologne. Very attractive prices, even for extra service, and good quality of service. Clean aircraft, efficient boarding  allowed us to depart and arrive on time, clear website and smartphone app, professional crew.",1
"Flew Spirit from Houston to Denver. The absolute worst traveling experience I have ever had. First they may as well take an arm, leg, and your first born child if you have any bags. Secondly, on the flight out here their plane may as well been held together with duct tape and bubble gum. Thirdly, now I'm stuck in Houston because, despite getting to the airport well over an hour before my flight was set to depart, Spirit denied me at the check in because I was ""too late to check in"". Save yourself the time and hassle. Avoid Spirit at all costs.",0
"Insel Air is the worst airline I have ever been on. Flying from Aruba to Curacao is a 20 minute flight, yet they always delay flights for several hours without notifying anyone. Flown with Insel twice, the first time I flew with them I was told the airplane left early. What type of airline does that? Leave early without notifying any passengers. Staff are rude, airplanes are old, never stick to schedule. I would suggest flying with any other airline.",0
"Terrible customer service, call centre takes ages to response and they keep putting you on hold for a significant time. I booked a ticket single for my wife and myself, Johannesburg to Durban I changed my flight paid a huge change fee almost the same price as my ticket for a day earlier. I received confirmation that my flight was change, and they added a return flight. I needed to change my wifes flight for an earlier flight on the web site I selected her flight and the system automatically assumed its a return flight Durban to Johannesburg no warning all all I choice a flight and when we received the confirmation slip her flight is a return flight. Tried calling the call centre for assistance I am waiting on the line and put on hold now for 29 minutes. I don't recommend this airline surprised that they won best airline award.",0
Great flight from Sydney to Christchurch. Service excellent from a very professional crew. Great choice of movies. Exit row seat comfortable. Will look at future travel with Qantas.,1
"I don't usually review airlines, but I actually had such a great experience with KLM that I decided to leave them an honest review, especially considering that, lately, airlines have been getting such a bad rep. The flight attendants all went above and beyond during our flight from Copenhagen to Amsterdam, as they were friendly and very accomodating. My partner and I mentioned in the beginning of the flight that it was our honeymoon and they gave us a little treat at the end of the flight. The comfort was great and the food provided was pretty good considering it was all inclusive. All in all, a great flight!",1
"I had tried to reschedule my July 2021 flight to 2022. The Customer Service team in UK and Finland were absolutely useless. They promised several times to email the options of rescheduling and received nothing. Complained so many times by telephone, email and Facebook. Only to receive auto reply on Facebook that my message would not be responded to. Never received such bad Customer service by any company!",0
"4hrs and still on hold. I don't care what's going on, this is completely unacceptable! Every flight I've ever been on with Allegiant has been delayed, postponed, or canceled. Once they even stranded my wife and I in Minneapolis by canceling the flight and using the planes to go to Allegiant field after a football game. Just left us there! Even if if costs more, use a different airline.",0
"This is the worst airline I have encountered and I travel extensively. Their policies are deceitful and customer service is not willing to help or even explain their policies at all. I went to check in for my flight and had already paid for my bags when I had purchased my flight. When I checked they were charging me an additional 4,000 pesos for my bags which I never even selected. When I brought this error up twice with customer service they said they could not help because I did not screenshot the error. Of course I did not screenshot any error because that amount was reflected on my account without me doing absolutely anything. Even worse they just told me that if I did not settle the balance they would not let me board the flight. This is just mind blowing and appalling.",0
"Flew Las Vegas to Auckland via Honolulu June 26th 2018 and returned July 19, 2018. A wonderful experience on all sectors, the cabin staff were outstanding, and the flight deck were very informative on the conditions expected throughout the flight. Hawaiian music and videos welcomed us onboard, and set the mood for a very enjoyable flight. I usually travel Air New Zealand out of Los Angeles or San Francisco but decided to try Hawaiian as they fly out of Las Vegas. I am so glad I did and would like to thank all of the crew, both cabin and flight deck for a job well done! The only complaint is with Honolulu airport. It is certainly overdue for a complete overhaul.",1
"Gatwick to Venice. We have flown this route and class on two occasions and been pleased with all aspects. On the recent trip we both had mobility issues and the check in operator immediately suggested their assistance service. It was welcome and efficient, particularly as the gate was a very distant one. The flight departed to time. The cabin staff were pleasant, the food was good. In flight information from the flight deck was good. The landings were noticeably smooth. The return journey was similarly good. I was very satisfied.",1
"Flew Auckland to Sydney with Emirates. The only way to fly Business Class across the Tasman if you are a One World Customer. A fully flat bed and all seats with aisle access, the alternatives are just nowhere near this. I could not fault any aspect of this service from check in to priority baggage collection.",1
"I am a frequent Allegiant passenger, they are the only airline that does not provide baggage check staff availability 2 hours before boarding time as the TSA recommends. My wife and I were standing for 1 hour and 45 minutes just to check bags and hoping to get a meal after clearing security on Aug 10th while flying back from a Nashville weekend. Unacceptable level of service! Frontier has my next flight!",0
Winnipeg to Kelowna. Missed my first flight and was not allowed on my connecting flight and would not also honour my flight home. I dont understand how a modern airline can have no customer service and why they would cancel every other flight of a long trip. Avoid this airline at all costs.,0
"Denver to Salt Lake City. I will never ponder giving this airline a penny! I recommend flying with an airline that while more expensive treats you like you matter. I would not fly Frontier again even if it was free. Mostly rude employees who have the ""I'm doing you a favor by helping You"" attitude. I could write a story about my experience, however I just want people to be aware that the old adage 'you get what you pay for' couldn't be more true than with this airline.",0
I had a problem with my return flight to Edmonton. I tried to correct it on line and no go. I went to airport in Kelowna and talked to someone at the counter. They called the supervisor Martyne and she was very helpful. She helped me rebook a flight home and found me the best price. Martyne went way beyond and above to help me solve my problems. I want to thank her again for all her help. A very treasured Employee.,1
"Booked via travel agent! Booked on a 0730 Finnair flight for a one day meeting in Oulu. Getting ready to leave the house at 0600 when I get a call from a colleague stating that the flight is cancelled. No announcement from either travel agent or Finnair. Travel agent informed me that Finnair automatically rebooked me on the 1430 flight. Finnair's website shows free seats in economy on the 0930 flight. Travel agent informs that these are ""premium economy"" and that Finnair requires 200EUR extra to sit in these. The difference in service is that I can change my flights whenever I want for a smaller fee. So ended up paying 200EUR to arrive 2 hours late. Finnair customer service couldn't be reached but a later call to complain results in the ""this is our policy and nothing we can do about it"" excuse.",0
"London Heathrow to Hong Kong via Dubai was a fantastic experience. Great lounge at T , planes on time, food and service was great. Bar at the back is a great place to while away some time. Wifi was not perfect, and the lounge at Dubai lacks the appeal of that at Heathrow T3 and Hong Kong. Overall a great experience and value for money. Chauffeur service to and from airport was another great facility.",1
"Boston to Philadelphia. The airport staff that helped me with booking of my flight was helpful. I requested an earlier flight instead of the stated flight time that was given to me in Lisbon, and the staff did everything to get me on board with the earlier time. I would give 5 star for this service.",1
I flew YYZ to PHX. Terrible flight. No leg room no entertainment no electrical outlets but the same price as before. I will fly any other option than AC Rouge from now on. I have been super elite on Air Canada for years and I feel somewhat betrayed. I flew BA to London last week because I'm so angry.,0
"Sydney to Guangzhou, absolutely superb. We chose business class on China Southern as the fares were quite reasonable, and we will continue to London. I cannot recall such lovely, genuine level of care and courtesies. The cabin staff were incredibly good and super efficient. And the  food was, unbelievable for airline food. My wife had the steak., probably one of the best steaks we have  enjoyed anywhere. Wanting something lighter, I had the salmon main course, beautiful. Also the trimmings, entrees, cheese selection and ice cream. A lot of leg room and the selection of new release movies was first class. Normally I would read a book and doze off, but instead watched three excellent movies. Had to ask the hostess to help me work the channel selections, not very clear. Seats quite comfortable, but the flat beds could be improved a little. I had some difficulty operating the movements properly. On Tuesday to London, we are on the Boeing 787 and if our trip from Sydney to Guangzhou is anything to go by, very much looking forward to the experience.",1
We had 5 flights with China Eastern while visiting China and Hong Kong. Our largest journey was Heathrow to Shanghai. Staff were very helpful and friendly. Aeroplane was very comfortable and choice of entertainment was fantastic. Only problem on every flight there was not a Vegetarian meal for me this was booked with our Tour Operator and requested three times during our visit. The Steward on the Heathrow flight managed to find some food for me so I thank him for that.,1
"Blue Islands Airline has a poor Website and I could not check in online.  No problem with British Airways, EasyJet or Flybe. Phoned up Blue Island Customer services. Dreadful customer service, just left waiting on hold. Only one carrier between Jersey and Guernsey, so much for competition. The customer services representative told me to queue up at the airport for a boarding pass.",0
"We booked a one way flight from Lima Peru to Denver Colorado. The price was okay and I do like the idea of paying for only what you use i.e. checked bags or carry on bags. However in our situation we have two stops in the US one in Fort Lauderdale and the other in Chicago since we will be changing planes in Chicago Spirit is charging us again for our extra bags. So now we have to pay for our checked bags twice even though we are on the same airlines and our flight to Chicago is a connecting flight to Denver. Also be sure to read all about the bag weights and size restrictions. We just had a wonderful surprise that we are only allowed one bag at 40lbs from Peru. The ""Customer Service"" agent at Spirit told me it's a limitation at the Lima airport. Which is false other Airlines allow customer two bags each. Imagine moving from Peru with only one checked bag. I really wish I would have read some of these reviews before booking Spirit never again will I fly Spirit.",0
This is the worst airline I have ever seen. Both sides of my flight had long long delays. My return flight has been canceled once they gave us another flight for four days later with no paying for hotel or taxi. This airline is terrible.,0
"I was on a flight yesterday that was cancelled which I blame no one for but then the staff afterwards was not helpful in the slightest. We were told that we would be put on a different flight which never happened then another which never happened.. we were told that all of our stuff was finally switched and we arrive this morning after waiting outside in the cold for 45 minutes last night to take a bus to the hotel, and we were told that the flight we were put on we actually weren't. And the woman this morning said and I quote ""I dont know why this happened, the woman last night made a huge mistake"" that being said nothing has been done to right this wrong. Then on top of that we were given the run around trying to find out were we needed to go to get our new boarding passes and we got a different answer every time.",0
"Flew Plus Class on Friday, 5th August on WS2 London Gatwick to Calgary. First long haul flight with WestJet. Over an hour delay before take off but otherwise the flight was good. The flight attendants were excellent and it is the first time I can honestly say that I've watched the safety presentation because the staff passed on a serious message with humour. The seat pitch was ok even when the passenger in front reclined her seat back. Food was very good and the sandwiches offered later were fresh tasting and filling. I had a problem with using my tablet and cable and on the return will use in house tablet etc. Overall I was very pleased with the WestJet experience and if the return flight is the same it will diminish the pain of leaving family behind.",1
Dirty Check in area. Uninterested staff. Boarding a fiasco and onboard poor service and constant loud announcements. This is my 3rd flight with AA in 4 days. Very poor airline. Will avoid when I can. Should not be in the OneWorld. Not up to the desired level.,0
We traveled from Singapore to Helsinki on the 20th July 2012 on flight AY 82. We had row 56 the last row. We were advised the entertainment system was not operating just as we took off. This was a 12 hour flight and no entertainment. As we were in the last row we were fed last and there was only one option which contained things I don't eat. We are flying back to Singapore on Finnair in October and are dreading it.,0
"Horrendous airline, avoid at all cost. I have been stranded in Pakistan for the past 4 months because of this airline. They have cancelled our flight 4 times and every time they do it the last minute. We were supposed to fly on the 16th of June and now they are telling us that the next available flight is on 16th of July. We asked for a refund and they refused to give it. We are already out of money due to being stranded here and they are taking advantage of that. This airline has been the worst airline I have ever travelled on. Wont ever be booking with them again and I suggest you do the same. Absolutely pathetic.",0
"Singapore to Sydney. Terrible, avoid at all costs TR2 route, the plane had issues had to exit the plane and reboard another. I'd rather poke my eyes out than fly Scoot ever again. Zero communication from crew. I'd rate this company zero out of ten, but it won't allow it so 1 star it is. Avoid at all costs.",0
"Absolutely the worst in customer service from the booking process to the agents at the airport who have no knowledge what so ever about entry requirements to any country. All they care about is money, they are rude and extremely unprofessional.",0
"Riyadh to Dubai. They call themselves a budget airline but work out more expensive when seats, luggage and meal on flight has been selected. I am sitting at the airport in Riyadh with updates coming up showing the flight being delayed hourly. I regret having booked this airline.",0
"Cancels flight at last minute saying operation reasons, the main reason being to cut down the cost if they do not get enough passengers. Booked flight tickets twice for Bangalore to Pune, each time one day before the departure date they notify that your flight is cancelled due to operational reasons. Don't know why others are not getting this many operational reasons as Go First. Not travelling with Go First next time even if I have to book costlier tickets with other airlines. If you cancel the tickets at least have guts to also refund convenience fees to customers, lost 1000 bucks on cancelling without any fault of mine. Needs huge improvement in customer service.",0
Houston to Chicago. This is the last time I get screwed by this airline. I will never buy a ticket from this airline again. Flight was supposed to leave at 2.35pm it's 4pm and still waiting. This is by far the most terrible airline service.,0
"Phoenix to Houston IAH. My back still hurts from flying yesterday. These are the most cramped seats and without back support, I've ever flown in. Pay a little more and fly another airline",0
"Egyptair is the worst airline I have ever travelled with. You can't reach them via phone in Toronto and email will take days to get a response and when you do, it's always a robotic email, like no one takes the time to understand the specific issue. My flight was from Toronto to Lagos via Cairo, the first part of the flight to Cairo was great, but as soon as you arrive Cairo at your gate to an African destination like Lagos, the terrible treatment begins. Upon arrival at Lagos, hundreds of bags didn't arrive with the plane. It's been over a week since my arrival to Lagos and my baggage still hasn't arrived, Egyptair doesn't have the courtesy to advise over multiple emails and phone calls on the status of the bag. The Lagos Airport is providing information this is normal and they are lots of Egyptair customers calling them as well for their bags. This is not an airline to patronize.",0
"This was my first time using this airline and trust and believe me when I say never again. Arrived at Tampa International for my 10.30am flight, was delayed to 11.30am. Then it was delayed at 12 and 2pm and finally at 4 pm we board the plane. We are almost getting to Chicago, when the plane is diverted to Detroit, keep in mind we had a connecting flight to Vegas in Chicago. We sat on the tarmac for 90 mins for refueling, we were not allowed off the plane. The plane finally arrives in Chicago at 9pm. Now our connecting flight is delayed. Needless to say we arrived the following morning. ",0
"If you want to fly on time, don't fly with Delta. They have 25 flights leaving around the same time and open 3 booths to drop your luggage. They also randomly chose to let passenger to a NYC flight go before everyone else, even if our flight was at the same time. Because they are so slow, passengers missed their flights so they had to book another flight again which made the waiting time even longer. Unless you want to arrive 3 or 4 hours before your flight to be able to catch it, fly with another company.",0
I was excited to travel in Virgin after the feedback I received from friends and made a reservation for travel in Dec 2022 but later had to change it to May 2023. Even before the travel the schedule changed several times and the final straw was then the schedule was changed leaving only 20min layover in Heathrow. This forced me to cancel my reservation which was a challenge to being with because of the more than 30min wait every time I called customer support. Once the booking was cancelled it took multiple email to customer support to get the funds back. This experience has left a very sour feeling making me reconsider ever booking on Virgin again.,0
"Auckland to Manila. This flight was a pleasant surprise. The flight crew from AKL to MNL were friendly, introduced themselves, knew our names, and was on top of service. There wasn't a lot of us in the section so it was pretty quiet. The food was good too. The domestic leg's food wasn't commendable. The fish looked dry and old but service was still great. The return flight to AKL was less noteworthy. Being in business class means faster boarding but the girl at the gate seemed confuse. Economy was quicker. Business class this time had more people and the crew wasn't as warm. Had a bit of the tired attitude. They didn't personally introduce themselves nor as warm, and service was average. The A330 triclass is great though. Plane left on time and it was mostly a smooth ride. I've recommended PAL to my partner for our next trip to MNL.",1
"Manchester to Islamabad with Pakistan Intl. Very poor service. No pillows. No blankets. No inflight entertainment system. Rubbish food. Staff not interested in passengers. Staff just standing in galley, curtains drawn talking between themselves. In my opinion this airline is the worst in the world.",0
"Phuket to Bangkok. While there was a delay with boarding time, the flight took off on time. Great all male cabin staff, very attentive and friendly. Would definitely fly with them again.",1
I flew with hand baggage but security at Dubai was quick. Entered lounge which was a bit small but good and drink offerings sound. Flight on A380 left on time. Few technical issues with IFE which would have been really irritating had it been a day flight. Decent snack and slept well. Arrivals lounge excellent. Would recommend.,1
I flew Business Class from Colombo to London. I have used the airline several times in the past and have always had a pleasant flight but this exceeded my expectations of Business Class. The crew were gracious and attentive. The food was superb and beautifully presented. The comfort of the seats enabled me to sleep peacefully for a few hours something I normally can never do on a long haul flight.,1
Denver to Charleston. The flight had several delays and unlike Frontier when we finally arrived to the airport they did not allow people with close connecting flights to exit first. They also did not call ahead to the connecting flights like other airlines to allow passengers to still board. Then when I finally get to the gate five minutes late they would not allow us to board. We had to go all the way back to customer service which was not close for assistance,0
Our flights S4322 June 22nd 2014 from Toronto to Ponta Delgada and returning on July 7th 2014 flight S4321 to Toronto were very pleasant. Both flights were on schedule and we arrived 10 minutes early on both. We have flown SATA ever since the airline started flying to Canada. The service was excellent and the crew was spectacular. Meals and service were excellent. We had a couple of free drinks after the meals on both flights. On the way back we even had fresh cheese and for dessert the famous Queijada of Vila Franca. They supplied a bassinet for our 10 month old grandson. We highly recommend.,1
Guangzhou to Auckland by CZ305. Cabin crew were very friendly and helpful. They said Happy Chinese New Year to every passenger. My seat was 42A which was beside the emergency exit. The leg room was very huge. The meals were delicious and lavatories were clean. The inflight entertainment had the latest films.,1
Gatwick to Kigali. The best way to get around Africa due to the young fleet of planes that is well maintained. Exceptional staff. Rwandair is always my first choice of carrier. Kigali is my favorite stopover city as well. I am glad they will be expanding with flights to New York soon.,1
"They probably need more passenger on the plane cause it looked like they add seats till people don't have any space for the legs anymore. The only position allowed is a straight rigid firm sitting. Impossible relax, impossible stretch, impossible rest! And that's why they reduced the bag sizes cause they're embarking more ppl on the same plane. It was a horrible experience.",0
"Woeful does not even cover it adequately. 1710 departure time with Norwegian was postponed until 1945 early on the day of departure but was still told to check in as normal due to the fact it might be brought forward. Tried to establish what the issue was and had three different reasons from various people at Norwegian. Three further delays and did not depart LGW for JFK until gone midnight. No uniformed staff at LGW, just a hapless handling agent who was calling the same customer number as the passengers. Extremely obnoxious and robotic call centre staff who were totally uninterested in their affected passengers and at one stage just put the phone down. ",0
"I flew with same bag while coming to Orlando from Cleveland, but while traveling back they want my bag to be in the bin and my handle was out side,. They want me to pay 99 or they will close the doors. Very rude and unacceptable behaviour.",0
"Lima to San Salvador. Avoid this airline! Our flight was delayed for four hours, then delayed again for two hours. We missed our tour in Quito. Avianca changed our flight for the next day, but then this flight was cancelled. They gave us a flight the following day. We lost two days of our vacation and spent 120USD on taxes. Avianca gave us a credit of 57USD. Avianca is a joke and should be avoided",0
"Kathmandu to Abu Dhabi. Booked seats were gone so I had to sit separate from my wife. Awful onboard service, it took more than 1.30h. before we got something to drink. After the meal the crew dissappeared and didn't came back. Nothing was served anymore. On arrival it took more than 20 mins before we could get out of the plane so we had only 1.15 hour transfer time left. When I got into the bus my wife was forbidden to join me because they said the bus was full which wasn't. It took 20 min before she arrived at the terminal. We were just in time to get our KLM flight to Amsterdam. KLM crew immediately gave us something to drink before take off when I told them about this bad experience. Unbelieveble that Etihad is a 5 Star airline.",0
"Dallas to Las Vegas with Spirit Airlines. I have never seen bait and switch like this by a company in all my 60 years. At what seemed like a cheap fare ended up being more than double. All just because I wanted to take 2 bags and sit next to my wife. They charge for credit card usage, 801 numbers, not printing out your on ticket. Very uncomfortable seating. It's Southwest all the way next time.",0
Santo Domingo to New York. I was not allowed on my flight because I was crying. I was supposed to leave an early morning flight and decided to change my flight because I did not feel safe in the Dominican republic I paid the fee and I change my flight when I got to the airport they expected me to pay money to move things along and supposedly had to get a special stamp. I was only in the country for one week I do not have to pay taxes. They did not allow me to board my flight.,0
"They take your money, cancel the service, but keep your money. Westjet changed 4 tickets from leaving Vancouver the morning of 22 Aug 2021 to leaving Vancouver the morning of 21 Aug 2021. When I declined the new date they cancelled my flight and gave me restrictive and useless credits for future flights instead of a refund. Plus, they're nearly impossible to contact. When I finally got a call back three days later they told me that is was company policy to issue credits and that credits were sanctioned in the bill of passenger rights. I lodged several formal complaints. Never again will I fly this airline.",0
"Cardiff to Cape Town via Doha. I missed my connecting flight from Doha to Cape Town and was stranded at the airport at 01h40, as you can imagine I was very stressedd. One of the staff, Londikile,  kindly comforted me and calmed me down and escorted me to the Transit desk on the other side of the airport. She went to liaise with one of the Supervisors, and they managed to get me onto the next flight to Johannesburg at 07h00. I am truly grateful for the kindness, shown towards me by these 2 special ladies and the staff at the transit desk, who also assisted me, so that I could contact my family in Cape Town. I can see why Qatar Airways has won awards over the last years, as it is due to their friendly service, professionalism and their culture towards their customers. Please convey my heartfelt thanks to these 2 employees, they went beyond and above.",1
"I have never had such a lousy experience with an airline in my entire life. And it isn't because of the uncomfortable seating, which is another problem all together. The problem with Frontier is that not one employee I spoke with is helpful in anyway. I opened a credit card with Frontier for the mileage program, and the company will not allow me to book a flight with these miles. I called on Monday, they say to call back because their system is down. I call Tuesday, same answer. On Wednesday I give one representative my information and spend over an hour and a half on the phone waiting to be transferred to the person who can help me. After waiting for that long the same guy picks up and says there is nothing he can do the system is down. So I ask to speak to his manager. He then puts me on hold for another 30 minutes and gives me to some guy who was not his manager and just said they couldn't do anything. So I asked to speak to an actual manager and they hung up the call. This company is poorly run to say the least. Have people who are passionate about your company who can help with issues, not just foreigners reading scripts who have absolutely no idea what to do.",0
Our flight from Phoenix to Cancun with Spirit Airlines was cancelled by email after we were checked in. We just paid for our luggage. They put us on another airline 24 hours later. They wouldn't refund our luggage and we had to pay for luggage on new airline. Similar experience on the way home. They cancelled our flight but made us wait 24 hours for their next flight. Wouldn't pay for rooms or meals.,0
"Berlin to Geneva via Zurich. I flew Swiss many times in the last months, both in business and economy and I have always thought there must be something that they will blow and i couldn't find anything so far. That is impressive. Talking here about the economy product, I got a seat at the emergency exit, with extra leg room, although the regular ones have plenty as well. You get almost a real breakfast, a very nice croissant, coffee and orange juice and a refill, efficient service and the finest touch is the Swiss chocolate bar you get at the end. Flights are on time, the entertainment system shows you were you are, how much time until touchdown, info about the places you are flying over and cartoons.And this on the small planes like the A320. It seems the best airline I have flown so far in short haul and once again I am impressed.",1
We arrived at Miami Airport at 7pm no line for checking in. The staff was professional and helped. Our flight boarded on time to Madrid plane was clean. Food was airplane food staff friendly. Airplane well equipped screen for movies music etc. Our connecting flight to Paris was on time my bags arrived and had no problems.,1
"Mumbai to Delhi. Yet again very disappointed. Again a dirty plane, dirty roof, vents, table, entertainment control and window surround. And although I had put my seat selection in my reservation I was put further down the plane in a middle seat. The reason for choosing seat 19D in my booking was to sit beside my colleague. We were both moved. Why bother asking us to select seats if you're going to stick us anywhere you like, even as a Star Alliance frequent flyer program. I flew with Air India in 2015 from the London to Mumbai and have chosen to avoid that on my last 5 visits with the exception of a couple of domestic flights and Air India have not failed to disappoint. Not good enough Air India. I'm a frequent flyer, taking long haul flights about 30 times a year plus domestic connections and Air India is really low grade.",0
"Spirit Airlines from Atlanta to Cleveland was cheap. Read fine print. Everything was exactly as expected. Just as good as any other flight on any other airline considering I knew it was a cheap flight and wasn't expecting any fluff. Professional and most importantly, flight was on time and very smooth from take off to landing. Already booked another trip with Spirit Airlines for my  husband and myself next month.",1
"Mumbai to London via Abu Dhabi. Really pathetic service and worst airline ever. Had booked business class ticket from Mumbai to London via Abu Dhabi as per there stop over policy given on website after booking they declined a hotel and asked for charges of AED 500, then they declined the chauffeur saying stop over is too less. Finally had to cancel the plan.",0
Personnel very kind. Food ok and seat comfort great. The long flight from Hong Kong to Nadi was a pleasure. Drinks were served all the time. Checking my baggage through to final destination with another airline was absolutely no problem.,1
"On a recent flight from Barcelona to Adelaide I had the connection with a layover of 20 hours in Doha. When I went to check in Barcelona, I was told that my checking luggage needs to be checked through to Adelaide and that it was not possible for me to get my luggage in Doha so I could check in to a hotel. Complete nonsense. Such a shame, I generally have found them to have quite good facilities, aircraft and crew.",0
"The flight in general was great, the problem was with the luggage handling, one of our suitcases was severely damaged when we arrived in Puerto Vallarta, we contacted customer support to get help and a solution to replace or fix our suitcase, I contacted them almost daily to try and resolve the issue as I had no suitcase for my flight back due to their mishandling of the luggage, and the only response I got was ""someone will contact you in the coming days"". This never happened, no one ever contacted me and no one even tried to fix my problem. In the end, I had to get my bag wrapped with plastic and call it a day! Their lack of support or customer service is very disappointing, I used to recommend Aeromexico as a good airline, now I would say, be careful and pray that you don't run into any issues, otherwise you will never get a solution to your problem, such a shame that they do not help themselves by helping their customers, this is something caused by them with no accountability whatsoever.",0
True to Covid we are unable to travel and Copa Airlines doesn't give any refund. Never ever more. We travelled since many years with them but its the last time!,0
The two crew ladies at the boarding door were very polite and courteous. They have maintained a smooth flow of passengers and are courteous to people on wheelchair. Her announcements are very clear. It's a packed flight. Crew members are cooperative.,1
"This was a great surprise as we have never flown Loganair before and expected a noisy prop jet, instead we had a small jet both ways. The ground staff were amazing as I requested a wheelchair for my husband at the last moment and they looked after him really well. It was a lovely smooth flight both ways and it took around an hour to reach our destination. We hope they continue to stay flying from Southampton as this is the best flight on that route we have ever had. I would certainly recommend the airline.",1
"I can't fault my flight from Keflavik to Amsterdam with WOW air. I had some of the best legroom I've had for no additional cost, as it was just a regular seat not an exit row, and was also sat next to my partner for no additional cost. Boarding was quick and we arrived in Amsterdam 35 minutes early! Staff were extremely friendly and I look forward to using them again!",1
Having read so many negative comments on various websites about how awful Thos Cook Airlines are I thought it only right to compliment them on a superb return flight from Gatwick to Antalya. Cabin crew were excellent. Food superb. Seats comfortable. And both flights on time. I have flown with a number of different airlines. My first time flying with Thos Cook and nothing but praise.,1
"Checked my luggage even though I explicitly do not want my luggage in checked luggage as it can get damaged and I have to wait to pick it up. Also made comments about me being late, even though I was in the boarding queue, but they messed up cabin luggage and had to get my carry on luggage a label, which was also messed up. Better spend a bit more to get a decent airline.",0
On Wednesday July 7th I had the best experience with the staff of the Flair team on board my flight. I had recently been very anxious and I want it to be recognized that team members Robert and Nicole went above and beyond anything they could do to help me. They treated me so well and calm that they helped my anxiety through out the plane ride. I would like to say that people like Nicole and Robert are the people needed to be flight attendants in all airlines.,1
"Jetblue is the worst. They claim the aeroplane is being serviced, then after it's serviced, lightning is interrupting take off while you could hear planes lading and taking off, next they have no planes, they put us on the next plane only to be told hrs late you have go back through security interrogation to re book 6hrs later. Lies after lies and pure disrespect.",0
Extremely disappointed with Allegiant Air. I will not suggest this airline to anyone. It will be my absolute last choice to ever fly with them again. Poor communication about delay. Kept setting back our delay. Ended up being over a 6 hour delay leaving us up the entire night. My total travel time was close to 11 hours. I could of driven to Grand Rapids in less time then it took to wait around for this flight that continued to get pushed back. They did nothing to work with us. We should be getting money back. This should not be happening. We did not even get an explanation of why we were delayed.,0
"Denver to Washington DC. Although the crew was very nice this is a terrible, low quality airline. The seats are absolutely horrible to sit in with no ability to recline. They are extremely uncomfortable which caused me severe back pain for the entire flight. There is also very little leg room, tiny tray tables, and they also charge for every snack and beverage except for tap water. Do yourself a favor and stay away from this pitiful, low budget, bottom of the barrel airline. I have no idea how they are staying in business but I will never use them again.",0
"Absolutely disgusting. Terrible service from the beginning to the end. Multiple extra charges for reasons which were not made clear anywhere on the website or in emails sent by Wizzair. Looks cheap, but in reality will end up more expensive than every reputable airline out there, just lacking leg room and given a slab of plastic for a headrest.",0
"This is my first time flying with Westjet, and I am disappointed. First, they lost my luggage. I was flying from Vancouver to Toronto, but my luggage went to Halifax. The name and plane seat of my checked luggage was also wrong, very wrong. Second, after I got my luggage back, my  new luggage lost a wheel! When I ask for compensation, the customer service was really horrible, and they never tell me the full information until I ask. I was told that I will receive an email after 5 minutes. But after 1 hour, I still not have received anything from Westjet. When I phone them up, the staff told me they could not find a file under my name, and then account does not exist.  I don't know how airline companies work, but Westjet was not able to fulfill a single ""responsibility"" for my case.",0
I have flown 4 Aeromexico flights in the past 6 months two roundtrips from Mexico City to Chicago and all 4 flights were excellent. One flight left 30 minutes late yet managed to arrive on time. The others left on time and arrived either on time or early. Newspapers and either breakfast or a light lunch onboard. Very friendly flight crews. No problems at all.,1
Brisbane to Hong Kong on Qantas A330. Good flight all round. New bed was comfortable and more spacious than other airlines I've recently flown. Food was good but ran out of my choice. There was an option to prebook the meal but I did not take it up. Service good. On time departure and early arrival. ,1
"Sarajevo to Dubai. Horrible experience. Unexplained delays. Landed in a different country! No apologies, no courtesy, no information. No explanation from anyone on delays. Never again.",0
"Will never fly Spirit again! Horrible flight. Huge delays. No explanation until after 2 hours with no beverages and seatbelt sign on while sitting on the Tarmac in Atlantic City! Rude gate staff. Absolutely not worth the ""savings."" ""Clerical error"" according to the pilot was the reason why we sat in Atlantic City! Really? Then we weren't even offered a free beverage not even water! I'm done with Spirit.",0
My luggage was left in Cleveland. I had a wedding to attend had no clothes nothing plus my flight was delayed 2 hours. Worst experience ever. When I called the airline they kept putting me on hold and transferring me back and forth. I asked to speak to a supervisor they just transferred me to a new representative.,0
"I booked a ticket for my son. Flight was cancelled due to Covid. Fair enough, I can perfectly understand. I waited until bailout came and that this airline could start reimbursing ticket. I filled up a form in June, we are in October, I still did not receive anything. Customer service never replies to calls, never replies to mails. They simply do not care at all. Living in Antwerp, I will now take all my flights out of Schiphol which offer excellent service by the way. I do not recommend Brussels Airlines at all.",0
"Reasonable cheap airfares for business class with new aircraft service.  Most convenient airlines to travel between Colombo and Bangkok. Thai Airways service has been improved when compared to last few months. Surprisingly, new serving practice with a higher standard of service.",1
"New York to Charlotte. Please be advised that Jetblue is not honouring flight in or out of JFK and are not informing customers but simply cancelling the flight. This has been the biggest disappointment thus far as my husband and I are trying to travel home for my grandfather's funeral. They are not providing us with a reasonable explanation as to why this is happening and are giving us a hard time with reimbursing the money we have already spent on our round trip flight. This is completely unacceptable and I advise you to think twice, no three times about booking a flight with this airline. Their communication is not what it should be especially when customers are already in route with their traveling plans. They will take your money and not refund it when it is reasonably owed to you. This is not how you conduct business at all.",0
Travelling with Jetstar return to Singapore from Australia on a Airbus A320. No pillow no leg room find it very difficult to get in and out of the seat. No complementary drink. Airfare over priced for what you get nothing. After travelling with other cheap airlines with the same aircraft more leg room better service free drink pillow and cheaper fares.,0
"On a flight with Vietjet Air from Bangkok to Chiang Mai last month I was forced to pay 2.5 times the original fare I paid for my daughter because we included the middle name on her booking form. The booking form asked to include Last Name, Middle Name and Given Name of any person travelling on the ticket. It did not ask for the names as they appear on the passport. My daughter's middle name does not appear on her passport. But because it asked for her middle name in this form I included it. Because of this they made me pay, in cash, more than the double flight cost to remove her middle name and get on the flight. This is just ridiculous and makes me very angry. She was identified through her passport but would not allow her on the flight because of her middle name. Where is the common sense and any sense of reason or fairness in this? Clearly just a blatant attempt to procure money from customers. And in cash too! I would love to pursue this matter further but already they are denying my claims through their customer service department.",0
"On the way to Key West our plane was delayed 3 hours. They delayed it after we had boarded, so we had to stay in the hot airplane with no air conditioning. We were told our best option was to check our bags because there wasn't much room on board. They told us our bags would reach our final destination. When we arrived in Key West mine, nor my families bags were on the carousel. We were told they were still sitting at Atlanta airport. We finally got them the next day. Flying back we also had a delay for 2 hours for no reason. We were not allowed to exit the plane. Flying with Delta was the worst experience I have encountered.",0
"London to Hanoi return. Our flight from London to Hanoi was delayed by 10.5 hours. The airline was dreadful at giving out any information. All they said was it was due to ""technical"" problems, rumours went round that it was a bird strike. Initially sent away for 3 hours with food vouchers, then told flight cancelled. Moved out of airport, into hotel, checked in, issued dinner and breakfast vouchers, then an hour later, told the plane would be flying that night and to get packed up again to be taken back to the airport. No apologies on the flight. Choice and quality of food in Business poor. The lie flat bed had a gap at the lower back level, making it quite uncomfortable. Cabin staff had poor understanding of English and were not particularly helpful. On arrival at Hanoi, no help on the ground for many people who had missed their connecting flights. On the return flight to London, a wait of 1hr 40 mins for the baggage to be delivered. Again, no information until it arrived and that was apparently due to not being able to open the luggage hold and a wait for engineers. On the return flight, my personal entertainment would not work, they were not able to fix it and luckily there was another seat I could use.",0
"Buffalo to Chicago. Terrible is not even close to how bad this airline is. To begin, my flight here was delayed a full hour. Now my flight was cancelled last minute and after trying to contact the company they said our only option was to travel back home 2 days after  our scheduled date. We asked about stand by and they said there was no way we could do stand by because the flights were completely booked. First of all that's a lie. Then they said they'd be able to get us on separate flights one at 11am and the other at 550 the next day. So we accepted since it's better than waiting 2 days. we decided to go to the airport an hour after talking on the phone since we weren't near the airport at that time and the man on the counter said we were able to get on a flight that same night which was the flight after the one we were scheduled to get on but since the other lady had already booked our separate flights it was no longer an option. So already beyond annoyed at this point. My friend then goes to the airport at 8am the next day for his 11am flight and they tell him that there's plenty available space on the 830am flight!  How was this not mentioned the day before. He barely made it to the 830am flight and then I decided to head to the airport straight after to see if I can get on the next flight home. They finally allowed me to do standby but 2 flights later still no space according to them. I am missing work and important meetings because employees don't care about their customers. I will never fly United again.",0
"I am so disappointed with Allegiant and will never book with them again. Coming to FLL our plane was delayed two times and now going back to Concord its delayed again twice. Why even have a time to come or go back? It wasn't because of the weather neither trip. The weather has been nice in both states. I think the fact airline does not think about people having other things to do and places to go. Worst airline ever, greatly disappointed.",0
"I could have driven back and forth from Miami to Orlando before our American Airlines plane actually took off. When I asked an attendant at the airport, she told me and several other passengers that she's sick of people asking her questions, she does not get paid enough and then she walked off leaving several other employees looking at each other dumbfounded. Now, after waiting forever to finally board and having to change gates to another gate completely across the crowded Miami airport, we are sitting on the plane waiting for them to ""fix"" something on it. Worst airline ever.",0
Arrived at Halifax Airport on Saturday morning 04.30 for our family trip to Cancun. Check in was slow with only one attendant taking her time. After scanning our passports the Air Canada attendant told us that because my husband and son has the same first names it causes problems for their system. She was very rude about the whole situation! Arrived in Toronto where the attendants were more professional and friendly. Inflight was uncomfortable and tight which can be expected with economy class. Overall flights were OK but we will avoid flying Air Canada again.,0
I loved the experience flying Vistara. I was really happy to get the breakfast and the amazing service by the crew. Vistara has taken full care of your entertainment as they have provided onboard wifi service. I would like to thank Mr. Priya Ranjan and other crew members for their amazing service.,1
Flew twice with Ethiopian Airlines from Entebbe to Johannesburg and it continues to be a pleasant experience. Staff are friendly and helpful. Will definitely recommend.,1
"Atlanta to Salisbury via Philadelphia. I will never fly them again and I know I'm not the only one from last night that feels the same way. My son gets motion sickness and while our flight from Atlanta to Philadelphia was extremely bumpy not to mention the aborted takeoff. We were late getting to Philadelphia which made us have to run from gate A to Gate F. Needless to say that did not help his motion sickness and when we sat down in the plane to go home to Salisbury MD he threw up. So rather than letting me clean it up they just decided to kick us off the plane, no explanation, no exceptions whatsoever. Absolute worst airline.",0
Flew from Singapore to KL. Great flight aircraft was clean and very comfortable. Plane left on time and arrived early at destination. Flight crew was very pleasant and helpful. I was very happy with the flight and had a great experience.,1
"Barcelona to Berlin. My last Ryanair flight. Absolutely abysmal airline. They cancelled flights 2 weeks in a row and did not have next available flights for 2 consecutive days. Their chat personnel do not help at all by answering queries. There is a long waiting time and they are slow once on line. Their refund procedure takes 28 days, and further delay if they need anything more from your end. I never know if I will receive my refunds eventually and if I will ever reach a destination through Ryanair.  I am a student and chose it to save costs but even at those low costs I will never book it again simply because of the delay and cancellation troubles, horrible customer care response and ridiculous refund policies.",0
"I had to fly a friend with altzheimers across the country with Air Canada in September. It is probably the longest possible distance across the country. I was first told it was not possible for her to be unaccompanied but later this was changed. In fact one stop that we had to book, the one in Calgary was eliminated. This was a great help to my friend. I very much appreciate that this service was offered. This is my first review to anyone ever, but I am very grateful that my friend was safely delivered across the country by Air Canada. ",1
"Stewardess made me place my carry on farther back on the plane even though I was in row 2. Late to get moving, all flight attendants were giving different passengers different answer to questions. I paid extra for the perks package and don't understand what value I got. On the way to my destination I not get preferred boarding and on the way back I was inconvenienced about baggage I paid for.",0
NPG 914 from Bangkok on March 15th and flight PG 124 on March 25th. Travelled with an elderly relative. Cabin crew were excellent in assisting us and even got a chair lift at Samui Airport to assist getting off the plane safely and nothing was too much trouble. Staff are only too happy to help.,1
"Odessa to New York via Kiev.  The most horrible airline.  I've never saw such a rude and nasty stewardesses. The food was discusting. My flight was delayed for over 7 hours, so in total I had to wait with my grandma, who is over 70 years old for over 10 hours in the airport. No one even offered water. When I went to the information center, they basically told me that they cannot help me.",0
"They scheduled our connecting flight so close to the arrival from Spokane that we missed our flight to New Orleans, had to jump through hoops to possibly get tickets on a later flight, stand in a 3 hour line, and I still think they are a bunch of liars who gave us nothing! Why not hold up the connecting flight when several people on the arriving flight get here late because of their incompetence. Thanks for ruining part of our vacation.",0
"New Orleans to Detroit. My first and last time with Spirit. After boarding and taxiing, all Spirit flights that had not taken off were grounded due to the tracking system being down. They allowed us to deplane and a few passengers that were complaining about how awful Spirit is were not allowed back on the flight due to a power struck male steward. About 9 people were lumped into him calling the gate and telling them that a ""group of girls"" no description or even informing those passengers that they were allowed back on. That 1130 flight finally took off around 3.30pm after boarding and deplaning a second time. The ""group of girls"" he reported included someone I was traveling with so I had no choice but to stay off their flight also. My traveling companion had a witness that said she was not any threat and simply stated that ""Spirit does suck"" and no one would listen or assist. So we took a wonderful Delta flight home!",0
"One of the worst flight ever with the worst ever staff. We booked an air india flight to Goa, but the flight was horrible so was the ground staff as well as the people sitting at the reception. There was an 11 month baby with us. At the time of check in we requested the ground staff to provide a better seat to at least the baby and the mother if not anyone else. But they did not cooperate. The air India website is so so poor. This is the first airline in which there was no choice of choosing a seat during web check in. I have traveled so many times before, each airline gives you a chance to choose the seats but that wasn't the case with this airline. Rather we got the last seat of the airline i.e., the seat near the washroom. It was smelling so bad and there was no one to listen to us. Again while coming back from GOA the same thing happened. The same seats were allotted. I called on their customer care and for like 25 minutes no one picked up the call. After 25 mins one of the customer care executive picked up the call and she was so rude. She said i am transferring the call but nothing happened after that I tried calling them again and then there was no response from their side. While calling the Air India customer care even if u are in a queue, your wait time and queue position keeps on increasing instead of coming down. The staff was highly rude and no cooperative and it was a terrible experience. The mother with the infant wasnt given any preference for the seat even after requesting them. It was one of the most terrible experience ever.",0
"This was hands down the worst airline I have flown. The plane got delayed got stuck in Dallas, they refused to help or refund ticket, 10 plus hours waiting over night. They would not provide room, no drink on plane. I will never fly with them again.",0
"Newark to London. My flight was delayed for over 7 hours. The staff were very hostile during the process of delay. We were transferred from one gate to another, we went to several gates, still, no aircraft to fly us to Heathrow, until after 7 hours. We were given a website to voice our concern, I did. No one from United Airlines customer care bothered to contact me. Rather I was sent an email to confirm if one of their agent's contacted me. I responded no. I have not heard from United Airlines since then. Poor service.",0
"They sold me open ticket, they cancelled the flight on their own, and then never allowed me to book a new ticket. I wasted many hours on their phone lines. They kept saying we don't have permission from travel agency and you should contact travel agency. even though I had contacted the travel agency many times and they had notified the airline to book me a new ticket and they could see it in their system. they still refused to help. My whole money and vacation got wasted. They are a seriously unhelpful, irresponsible and greedy airline.",0
"London to Toronto and this was a much better experience with Air Canada than the one I enjoyed last Monday and Tuesday, because although my flight back to London in 19th August 2019 was ok the only bad part about the flight was that I sat in the back of the plane and it was the worst place to sit on a plane because of the engines being so loud and felt big turbulence. But, my flight to Toronto on 21st July 2019 was much better because a great part about the flight was that I was originally supposed to sit in 21H aisle seat but they changed it to 21K window seat and it was the best seat I had and the engines were much quieter but on my return flight.",1
Horrible experience on more than one occasion and destination with this airline. I will choose to pay extra and have a stop over to avoid flying them again! I will only fly them again if there is no other choice. The only reason I am giving the airline a 2 and not a 0 is because I had decent flight attendants and was served a decent meal. People at the check in counter both in Calgary and other countries awful as well. Not willing to help and each person you talk to will give you a different story.,0
"Kelowna to Winnipeg via Edmonton. Flair Airlines lost my baggage, even though it was a domestic flight. I have not even heard from them since landing in Winnipeg. I am waiting in a hotel since this isn't my last stop and they haven't been in touch with me to even let me know if they have found it. Do not fly with them. Terrible service. They won't even pay for my hotel which I am only staying in because they have lost all my baggage.",0
"Kuala Lumpur to Seoul. I put in a bid to upgrade to business class for a trip on 4th August, and when my bid was accepted I wanted to cancel.  I contacted the Reservations department by phone, they told me there's no phone number for the MH upgrade department. How convenient.",0
"Ryanair just spoilt my holidays. They started boarding too early and kept people outside under the rain when the temperature was about 8 degrees during 40 minutes. The airplane wasn't prepared for boarding why? After that 2,5 hours flight like in the fridge. t the end I arrived with a cold and thanks Ryanair you spoil my holiday.",0
"I had a great experience with Allegiant Air! Everyone was decent and cordial. The stewardesses were polite and so were the pilots. I did my part and arrived at the times I should and everything went smoothly. The seats were ok, I'm 5'8 and for the cost of the ticket I'm not complaining. I'm not the type of person who needs bells and whistles when I fly. I just want to get to my destinations safely. I should add I have a massive fear of flying and taking off scares me greatly.  You can get your alcohol and snacks like with anyone else. So for anyone looking to book with Allegiant I say go for it, the money you save can be put towards better use on your vacation or drinks on the plane.  BTW the price difference was about 200 bucks compared to other airlines for an adult and child.",1
"My family flew to Fort Lauderdale and back to Concord on separate flights. My first flight left on time but my sister's flight was scheduled to leave at 9am did not leave until 3.45 pm. On return flight my plan was scheduled to take off at 6 pm, we finally got on the plan after 7 pm and didn't take off until 8.30pm. My sister's return flight was scheduled to take off at 1 pm and didn't take off until 3.30. The customer service is the worst I have experienced. ",0
"I understand most of the people do the check in online in order not to stay in lines in the airport, however now there is another reason. The check in in the airport cost extra money. In my case it cost the same amount as the flight ticket. It's not the fact that I paid the money which annoys me the most, it's the fact I was not informed, let me decide if I want to pay that or not.  When I asked at their office why there is no notice, they replied that we should be the ones who research online about this, I feel like I was scammed.",0
Phoenix to Omaha. This company was absolutely amazing. My mom has cancer and was going thru a ton of pain but we made it to our original flight. Still in pain they had a wheel chair for her and got her on the plane first to make her comfortable.  When we got her off the plane they had a wheel chair for her and took us to baggage and even helped with getting her to the restroom. Both Phoenix and Omaha employees went over and beyond. I will use them always going forward.,1
Flew on Embraer 190 from SFO to YVR and have to say that the FA was absolutely the best I have experienced. Service was top notch. Had no problems with the inflight entertainment system either. If you are going to be flying executive first on EM190 try and book a seat on the left side of the cabin since you will have the half of the aircraft to yourself.,1
"Dubai to Manila, I noticed that one of my luggage was broken.  At the counter, the representative took some photos and gave me the report, ensuring me that I would have received an email within 5 days. As of today, no email is yet received. Upon departure back to Dubai, yesterday morning with flight PR659, I passed once again by the Philippine Airlines office in Manila Airport to follow up. The representative told me that I would have received an email within 12 hours. On our return flight, the aircraft and seats were different. No screens and  claustrophobic seats. I asked the supervisor if I could purchase the seats with extra space for legs and she told me that I should have done that on the ground because the flight was not equipped with credit card machine. How could I have known that the aircraft was different?",0
Great inflight experience with generous and well versed staff. Leg room was disappointing but otherwise a wonderful journey throughout. Would recommend SpiceJet as a flight option to friends and colleagues.,1
"London to Kochi via Bahrain. The flight from London to Bahrain was alright. However in the second flight form Bahrain to Kochi the plane was very old. Service was rude and food quality poor. Same in the return in the flight from Kochi to Bahrain the plane was very old, clearly outdated. I would not fly with them again, it was scary.",0
"Nashville to Las Vegas. We saved up for the trip for months. My husband was taking me to Vegas for my birthday. We were at the airport 3 hours early. Got checked in went to find out just were we would be boarding and the walked to get food. It was 45 minutes before time to get on the plane. We walked back to the area the lady was on her phone talking to a friend. I know this because I could hear her conversation when I walked up to see if we were still in the right area. Well we got in the boarding line when we got to the check in door the girl taking the ticket said please go to the counter. I said for what, I had read all the bad things about this airlines but hey I try to stay positive we were excited about a getaway. We talked to the so called Supervisor. She said the plane was gone, she said she announced it several times I said but we were right here I even talked to her. She became rude saying well you all are the only ones that did not here me.  Well can we get on another flight no she states well can we get our money back .. no it's not my fault she states. Then threatens to call security. What about our bags they are in the flight that has left. She said what you want me to do? Then she says we usually don't do this but I can try and get you all on a flight on Wednesday. I said but we would we do about rooming until then she said I dont know. Or you can get on a plane Friday.",0
"I am really disappointed with American Airlines. I got one cancellation and two delays for my flights. It was not delayed because of the weather problems, but because of maintenance problems. Moreover, my flight was supposed to be at 10.30 am and they just arbitrarily changed our flight to 10.00 pm without explanation. I wanted to get a refund and change my flight to another airline because I have an important schedule. However, they just say they are not sure whether I can get a refund or not. I will never use this airline again.",0
"Air Transat moved my flight to an earlier time several weeks after booking, which messed up all of my reservations at the other end. Several weeks later, Air Transat cancelled my club class reservation and offered to replace it for an economy seat. The refund that was offered did not reflect the cost difference between an economy seat and club class seat at the time of booking, which is daylight robbery. I haven't been away in a while and travelling to America is a once in a lifetime experience, so I thought I'd treat myself, but Air Transat have done their best to ruin the start of my trip. Make sure you book with a different airline as these people will mess you about. I wish I'd listened to the other reviews.",0
Flew Oakland to Phoenix. Southwest Airlines has always been great to me. Today they showed me why I will always choose them as my preferred airline. My meeting got canceled and I was supposed to fly out at 5pm today. I am now on 6.30am flight to Phoenix. Best customer service.,1
"Moscow to Dammam via Bahrain. Very disappointed.  At connection airport while boarding i had a boarding pass, but was not allowed to pass to the aircraft as Gulf Air manager dropped passengers out from the flight thinking that connection flight would be delayed. But it was in time. I had even boarding pass, but airport personnel called Gulf Air manager and he refused to board. When i approached Gulf Air manager he told me that flight is boarded already, and that he was not aware of call from departure gate when it was opened and i was there. Now i will fly night time with flight which is 5 hours later.",0
"Philadelphia to Grand Rapids. Worst travel experience I've had in over 40 years of travel. Purchased round trip tickets. Both legs had huge delays which we not communicated in advance Customers service reps are poorly trained, surly and were of no help. Had to demand they check my bags so that I wasn't stuck waiting in the departure area that had limited seating and no amenities. Reason given for the delay both times was that they did not have a crew available. Isn't that how to run an airline? Schedule a flight and have a crew seems to be basic. Lost out on business both ways due to their delays and they could not care less.",0
Flew from Birmingham to Berlin on 5 day winter break. Could not fault timeliness and having booked the smart price seating we were very impressed with leg room available. Plus the plane was very clean and gave a light and airy feeling. The food on offer was not very original with the same on offer outbound and inbound however people must remember that these are budget flights and for the money paid everything from check in through inflight was excellent. We would have no hesitation in using this company again and will be recommending them to friends and family.,1
"Emirates flight, Luanda to Dubai in business class. Very much enjoyed my flight. The food tasty and filling. Staff friendly and attentive. Seat comfortable. Great airline and they put European airlines to shame.",1
Don't book flights with this company unless you are willing to wait a lot and especially if you have connecting flights. Went for a weekend to Stuttgart. Flew from Amsterdam to Stuttgart on Friday and back from Stuttgart to Amsterdam on Monday. Both flights were delayed last notice for 1h and 30'. This is a huge delay for a flight of around 1h 15',0
Never again! We were supposed to be home at 8pm on Feb 18 from Mexico we got home at 3am Feb 19. There was not enough food water was rarely offered. We were supposed to be direct home to Edmonton but were diverted to Winnipeg! We travel quite a bit and always go away in the winter but I would not recommend this airline.,0
Dublin to Doha. My wife and I want to compliment the cabin crew who had to cope with a seriously autistic boy who was very disturbed during the flight. The cabin staff treated the boy and his father with complete dignity and compassion. We have never before seen such a thorough level of professionalism.,1
"Albany to Columbus via Newark. Horrendous. First, they failed to provide adequate tickets needed to board, which caused a slight delay. I checked my luggage in. They then ran after me and forced me to take the lock off of my bag. Now, my property is subject to theft. That does not sound right. Coming off the flight in Newark, we are pushed onto a bus. I verbally told the surrounding crew that my next flight departs in 20 minutes. They were dismissive and ordered me to simply get on the bus. I had no other choice but to comply. I'm with my 6 year old child. This whole ordeal caused a rush, resulting in an inability to feed my child. I asked several people if there were meals provided. They assured me there were. When we boarded, I inquired again, only to be laughed at.",0
"Indianapolis to Rome return via Atlanta and Detroit. We flew first on the domestic segments and Delta One on the transatlantic segments. The flights were on time, the planes were clean with new interiors. The best thing about this trip was the service provided by all the flight attendants. It couldn't have been better. The attendants were all simply outstanding.",1
I was rebooked with Aer lingus to Dublin after our BA flight was cancelled due to technical difficulties. We were very impressed with the friendly and professional service offered. The aircraft was spotless fresh and bright. The crew kept us informed of our progress and had issued a very warm welcome on boarding. On the downside we had booked on a full service airline where drinks and a snack were included on Aer Lingus you pay. However the full breakfast I ordered was delicious and well worth the money. I look forward to booking with you in the future.,1
"Portland to New York. A horrific display of incompetence by one of the ground staff as they backed into the plane breaking their bumper of the towing vehicle and delayed our flight that put it behind a long list of other delayed flights. I am typing this, having been delayed for several hours as we sit on the tarmac. The staff is rude and on edge. They don't want to answer any questions by the customers in the plane. The staff doesn't seem to know what they are doing and have made a mildly annoying experience into a truly terrible one. We will not be flying with Jet Blue ever again.",0
We flew from Edinburgh and got there in plenty time. Queue was not at all bad. Service was excellent. On the way home from Lanzarote the queue was again not bad service was good. I also have to say that the cabin crew on the flight from Lanzarote to Edinburgh on 18th August were brilliant they were attentive cheerful and very helpful.,1
"My husband and I used Air Canada to fly Pittsburgh to Toronto to Rome in May. We had no luggage when we arrive, and never received luggage during the two weeks we were in Italy. My numerous calls from Rome to Air Canada baggage agents in Toronto established that Air Canada did not load our bags on the flight to Rome. An Air Canada agent stated that the bags would arrive in Rome on 27 May. The number given to me to call the Rome airport to determine the status of the lost luggage never answered even though I and various Italian friends repeatedly called it. Air Canada was aware of this issue and promised to contact the Rome airport on our behalf but they never did so. My bag was delivered to my home on June 11th, five days after we had returned to the US. My husband's bag was delivered on July 11th. Air Canada promised us a passenger reimbursement for expenses we incurred because we had no luggage. Nevertheless, Air Canada they ignored my claim for this reimbursement. Air Canada is hiding behind the fact that the last carrier we flew to Rome was Lufthansa. ",0
Charleston to Los Angeles via Atlanta with Delta. Missed our connection by 10 minutes. When we deplaned in Atlanta we are told to check our connection on the board. We ran to our connecting flight and arrived 8 minutes before leaving. We are told the gate was closed and to go to the Delta counter for rebooking. The gate attendants responded as if this happens all the time. We are not young but even worse than that were the families with young children and the lack of compassion they are given. Did I mention or connection was late because we waited for someone in Charleston. Is this how Delta in Atlanta treats families and older people? Appalling.,0
"Horrible first experience. Cabin dirty with food on floor, empty bottles in seat pocket and tray table was sticky. Flight attendants did not care one bit. Rude, arrogant and seemed to be bothered by advising uncleared areas.",0
"My wife had a carry on for her self and diaper bag for a 7 months old baby. We were harrased right before the boarding that diaper bag is not allowed. She could either bring her carry on or diaper bag. I showed this person from the Air India website that a personal item is allowed other than carry on such as laptop or diaper bag and threatened us that he will not let us take this flight. That was the end of discussion. Very rude staff, I will never fly with Air India again ever. Also for both inbound and outbound flights my in flight entertainment screen was broken. Imagine travelling 14 hours straight without screen.",0
"Frankfurt to Changsha in January 2020. Overall the service was satisfying. Plus it was in the early stage of the virus outbreak, the airline and cabin crew took special measures to provide safety and protections, which was reassuring and much needed. Thanks to all cabin crew members  who made great effort looking for a lost item and continued helping even days after our arrival. Appreciated!",1
Bucharest to Luton. Every time when the departure is from Bucharest the staff that is checking the tickets is very rude. All the rest is ok. They always find problems to your luggage and this is happening only from Bucharest.,0
"Singapore to Paris via Dubai. Our seats were changed without notice.I would like to clarify that the seat from Dubai to Paris was already allocated to us in Singapore Changi Airport. Our seats was arrange seated together. When we arrived in Dubai, they replaced us with another boarding pass. As for the luggage, They damaged my luggage with one wheel missing and replaced me with a smaller and Low quality luggage.",0
"Just had the worst customer service experience of my life with Breeze Airways. Two days before my flight was scheduled to depart, they emailed me with a notification that my flight had been cancelled. No opportunity for recourse, no phone number on their website, and no response for almost 24 hours to the emails, sms messages, and messenger app messages I sent. Even worse, if and when they do finally respond to you, it turns out that they won't even help you rebook a comparable flight. It's basically, ""Sorry, you're out of luck."" This is absolutely unacceptable. I built my vacation around the availability of this flight. As a result of their mistakes, I had to book a far worse flight at a far greater cost that will not get me to my destination in time to work the next day, which means that I am also losing income. Overall, their mistakes are costing me hundreds of dollars and a lot of wasted time and energy, and they offer no real compensation or even sincere apologies for what they have done. I know budget flights are tempting, but given my experience here I would highly recommend avoiding Breeze Airways. They are worse than all others.",0
"Aer Lingus lost our baggage on a flight from Dublin to Edinburgh 7 days ago. We did everything we were asked. We gave the address to the hotel where we were staying but the baggage never arrived. We requested that the baggage be sent to Glasgow Airport and held until Friday August 2nd Where we would be flying out of next and Aer Lingus representative agreed to do so and we have a confirmation. Once we arrived in to Glasgow Airport we were told the baggage was sent back to Edinburgh for some unknown reason. We have traveled without personal belongings for 7 days because the team has lied to us and been unprofessional.  After many phone calls, emails, and claims on their website we still are unsure where the baggage is or if we will ever see it again. We have requested that the baggage be mailed to our home to which they agreed. As of this morning however they can no longer locate our baggage. This is bad communication, bad service, and overall unprofessionalism.",0
"Overall I would say American Airlines is a pretty good airline. My outbound flight from London Heathrow to Charlotte was fine, as was the internal between Charlotte and LaGuardia. But as my return flight from New York to London Heathrow was overnight I went ahead and purchased extra legroom which included priority boarding. Except it didn't. Boarding was exactly the same and the extra legroom was minimal. I am 6 foot 3 inches tall and even with the extra space it was pretty close to my knees. ""Up to an extra 6 inches"" it said, well I suppose it is correct as I estimate 3 inches was what I got and technically that is up to 6 inches. Called customer services who refused to even entertain my complain. Shocking customer service.",0
I get terribly motion sick so I have chosen to drive for years. This trip from Charlotte to New Orleans via Houston driving was not an option. I was anxious that I would be sick and miserable the whole flight. Thankfully I was not and the Southwest Airlines crew were friendly and funny. On both legs of the flight we were delayed a bit due to bad weather but the connecting flight waited for the 40 or so passengers to arrive. Unfortunately due to the flight delay our baggage wasn't transferred in time so once we arrived in New Orleans we had to go to the desk and submit a baggage ticket. The women at the desk were patient even though I was about to lose my mind! They located our luggage on the next flight and promptly brought it our hotel and they gave us an airport meal voucher and 2 drink vouchers even though we decided not to wait. The trip back home was just a pleasant and our luggage arrived with us. I will be flying again in 2 weeks and again over the summer on Southwest. I like the reasonable fares and the free baggage but the excellent customer service shown by Southwest will keep me a loyal customer. Customer service is free but it makes all the difference.,1
"London to Melbourne via Guangzhou. Nice airplane, accommodating cabin crew, very nice in greeting us as we came on board. Had some assist me in putting my carry on into the overhead compartment, as well as many of the staff just greet me as I passed by. Extremely great service and comfortable flight.",1
Seattle to Toronto on AC542. Nice and relaxed flight just a bit late because of the traffic congestion on the Seattle airport at the time of departure. E190 cabin light and fresh seating way better that on a larger types of aircraft. Flight attendants professional and friendly. Good inflight entertainment a large selection of Canadian movies including documentaries and short ones which is really nice.,1
"San Francisco to Kathmandu via Guangzhou. Amazing trip for us. ,Senior people with my wife and were on wheelchair got the excellent service. The crew did tremendous job, fully satisfied even we didn't have hotel reservation we got the hotel for long transit. Will fly again and recommend.",1
"Manchester to Sylhet. One of the worst experiences for my elderly parents. Both aged 80 plus. At the airport it all started. The lady at desk had a sour face on, not giving eye contact or listening, neither checking details properly. There were doctors letters, we had already liaised with the airline, I specifically described their medical needs and they had bracelets to show their claims, conditions etc. All she said was okay. The idea was to provide them with an aisle seat and to be near a toilet to avoid any accidents on the plane that would inconvenience other passengers. The flight was delayed, they were made to sit in the middle in cramped conditions, knee to knee seats causing my parents to suffer with breathing and other conditions. They tried to show the cabin crew the letters and expressed their struggle, but they were completely disregarded and ignored. There's others to consider too, but when it's been prior arranged. You would expect the cabin crews to follow the instructions. Appalling behaviour from Biman Bangladesh Airlines.",0
"Manila to Cebu. Delayed. Unfriendly staff. We were transferred from one plane to another. Our baggage arrived earlier than us, we end up in Cebu looking for our baggage and we do not know where to find it took us 3hrs before we got our baggage.  The staff shouted on us and said that we are not paying attention when our names were called!",0
"Air Canada Rouge, Lax to Manchester via Toronto. What a disgrace they are to the Air Canada family. The only nice thing I have to say was that we landed safely back in Manchester. Other than that I can't think of anything nice to say. ",0
Chicago to Stockholm. Really great flight. This is more first than business in my view. The SAS crew was fab and love what they are doing by the look of it. The food was fantastic. They offered a menu with good variation. After a good meal it was time to take a nap. The bed was really comfortable as well.,1
"Extremely small and tight plane. Sat with my knees pushed in the seat in front of me and had a hard time freeing myself every time I wanted to stand up. The seats are barely cushioned and you cant even move the headrest at all! The corridor is also really narrow, I noticed a lot of people that sat by the corridor got hit again and again by the staff, the staff trolley and other passengers. Would definitely not recommend.",0
"Melbourne to London via Bandar Seri Begawan. The plane was elegant, the cabin crew very professional and made a long flight more pleasant. The food was great. I have to say that Royal Brunei is my favorite airline. The planes are new, Brunei airport is fairly small and easy to get around and to check in or transit, while the ground staff is polite. The inflight entertainment is very good, but there are spaces for improvement. Toilets and planes are the cleanest.",1
"Mumbai to Dublin via Istanbul. Never book Turkish airlines if you are traveling to Dublin from Mumbai. If the flight gets delay from Mumbai, they don't have any other options for you. They will straight forward ask you to stay in hotel in Istanbul. They do not care for any for your time loss. No decisions has been made from airlines crew within time. They kept me waiting for more than 3 hours.",0
"Unbelievably poor service. 10 hour delay on flight out of Keflavik to Glasgow. To make matters worse, we were made to go to a gate, made to carry our bags upstairs, then left in a room with 2 staff who didn't talk to anyone. Then one by one we started to get emails telling us that the flight had been delayed. We then had to queue up to talk to the staff member who told us we then had to carry our bags back down the stairs and across the airport to go to the Service Desk as he couldn't tell us anything.. We then had to ask for meal vouchers as they weren't provided and i know many passengers who didn't know to ask so had to spend their own money. If only they had had the decency to make a announcement, rather than hide behind an email and then give us all the information and vouchers without having to queue up so many times. There was really no feeling from the staff, they really didn't care than our flight was almost 10 hours late.",0
"I am surprised that Thai Lion Air is a low cost airline. With the low price, you have a free checked luggage, free seat selection and even a snack on board. All flights were on time and definitely will use them again.",1
"The flight leaving Atlanta to Panama, the Atlanta check in line wait was two and a half hours. They only had 2 workers working. They lost my bag by forgetting to put a tag on my bag and then blamed me. Their service is terrible and they never called or did anything to help me. Customer service phone lines we called for 7 hours nobody answered. The claim I filed was 17 days ago, they have done nothing.",0
"Las Vegas to Myrtle Beach with American Airlines. I'm very dissatisfied with the wait for boarding and when finally on the plane, the seats are crammed in like a sardine can. It's very disappointing that AA over charges for flights then put us on dated aircraft. It's impossible to be comfortable sitting on top of one another. AA is going up there with Spirit and Frontier of the airlines I won't fly with any longer.",0
"I did the round trip from London Heathrow to Hong Kong. I haven't flown Virgin Atlantic for a few years, but having experienced shockingly bad service from British Airways I thought it was time to look at other airlines. Virgin Atlantic have always been a good option and I was really curious about their new 787. Service wise, Virgin Atlantic did not disappoint. The staff were helpful and the food was pretty good. What I didn't like was as follows. The policy on personal luggage. I had to empty out 2kg of my possessions from my small case because it was over weight and put into my backpack. I mean does that change anything? The dimming on the windows was a fail. Interesting concept, but in reality it was a nuisance. The dimming switch on the row in front broke and they had to cover it over with a plastic sheet and involved 6 members of the cabin crew. The headphone socket was on the seat back next to the screen. I found it hard to eat and listen to music etc. The onboard entertainment system is limited and I dislike having to watch 5 minutes of Richard Branson waffling before the start of a new film. The toilet seat can't stay up. The flights were on schedule and the service was good. I could live with a lot of these issues and I wouldn't have a problem flying again with Virgin Atlantic.",1
Brussels to Casablanca. I had to pay extra 50 euros at airport for having just 2 kilos more. I am very disappointed. My ticket cost me 200 euros at the start now cost me 250. Totally ridiculous At the end had to wait 1 hour at arrival the get back my luggage.,0
Riyadh to Dubai. Organised and efficient. I take this route every week. Most of the times the plane arrives before scheduled time. The only suggestion I have is to apply strict hand baggage control in Dubai Airport,1
Poor service. Dirty plane. Awful food. Cabin crew were good. SriLankan have no concept of customer service. On return flight changed my flight to a stopping flight without consulting me. If I wanted a stopping flight I would have gone Qatar. Cheaper and much better. Will never fly with them again. I travel to SL at least 5 times a year.,0
"Sydney to Rome via Abu Dhabi. I booked my tickets over the phone with a call centre and the experience was excellent. I was assured as a Velocity Gold Member I would have lounge access in Abu Dhabi both ways, in Sydney and in Rome. I was told only that my changed booking from Bangkok to Danang would not be with Etihad but with Bangkok Airways. I gave the call centre staff member all 3 Velocity membership numbers as we are a family pooler. They were recorded duly. So, all good. I then also, as a precaution, emailed Velocity and Etihad again to confirm lounge access and received a response from both airways advising of lounge access details. Everything was great at Sydney except I was told they could not print off my boarding pass for Abu Dhabi to Rome as there was a problem with their software. Never mind, these things happen. We experienced the lounge in Sydney and it was, it has to be said, pretty solid. Food and drink were on the mark, and service was good.  On arrival in Abu Dhabi, however, things started to unravel. We were shuffled to 3 different places before I was able to be issued my boarding pass. Then off we went to the lounge. On arrival at Al Rheim lounge we were advised we could not access as our forward journey to Rome was operated by Alitalia. Despite the emails I had from both airlines, no go, as it was a codeshare flight. I was advised to write a complaint to Etihad once we were back. So, we wiped our losses and paid for another lounge. On the way back, no lounge in Rome, but we were allowed access to the Al Rheim lounge in Abu Dhabi. However, when we arrived back, things grew worse. I lodged a complaint with the details and evidence. Then we waited for our points and waited. And waited some more. Finally we lodged a request with Velocity and waited the 2 months. We then contacted Velocity again and they said they would need to escalate the issue with Etihad. We were also told by the attendant at Velocity Gold member inquiries that Etihad were ""known"" for this type of behaviour and often allocated points and status credits incorrectly. It has been a lot of work to try and get this mess sorted out. Since January when we wrote a complaint to Etihad we haven't even had a response. It has to be said that for the 3 of us, it was our first and last experience with Etihad. What a disappointment.",0
My partner and I recently flew to NYC. He on Air Canada where they make you pay for all checked baggage and I with Westjet. My checked bag was free. Westjet recently added a free cocktail to international flights. Toronto to New York is only 1 hour so I enjoyed my drink quickly. Excellent flight there but on the way back is what made the trip. I just missed my flight. The Staff at the gate took care of everything courteously and professionally. I expected to have to go back to the front desk and go through security again but he took care of everything while I was able to watch Euro cup in the lounge! This is highly impressive as it was a challenge for the staff as they are all new Westjet only started flying out of NYC three weeks earlier. 1 hour later I was on a plane watching the ground staff wave bye to the passengers on my plane!,1
"Rude staff. We were asked to move because of the weight of the plane. We did to be accommodating. To our surprise we were placed in pretty much a closet size Space in the last row, no way to recline and no way to get any air. Not sure if it was broken but everyone around us was panicked, uncomfortable and fanning themselves furiously. The flight attendant was about as worthless as a box of rocks. Here and the other flight attendant spent the whole flight loudly gossiping with her rear end directly in my friends face sometimes resting it on her arm. No one cared, no sense of urgency. But hey, you get what you pay for right?",0
"We had some troubles getting to the airport and were so worried we were going to be late. We arrived at the check in counter just a few minutes late, but the Jin Air employees were so kind and accommodating. They got us through security and to our gate and we made a flight we otherwise would have definitely missed. Just so grateful! Thank you!",1
I will never fly with Air Transat again. Flew from Puerto Vallarta to Edmonton. Waited over 2 hours in line and rushed to board the plane only to be greeted by unhappy staff. The announcements could not be heard as they spoke so fast. The seats are cramped. The food was not good. A smile and an apology would have helped this flight survive but the reply was only it was not their fault. I felt I was bothering them by asking a question. ,0
"Had some booking options open in multiple tabs. Decided on one of the configurations and clicked OK on that page to a certain price. Their site took the most expensive configuration from my tabs and now I'm stuck with something I don't need. After waiting an hour and a half in a customer service queue, they said they couldn't help me. Never flying with Transavia again and would strongly advise anyone else to never use them!",0
Alaska Airlines has great domestic service. I fly them every time to Seattle and anywhere else if I can. The flight attendants are friendly. I use my miles and it is very easy. The airline provided complimentary beer or wine which is nice. I like the fact they would give us updates or the pilot would tell us weather conditions. They arrive usually early which is great. When departing the plane it's easy to grab your bag on the cart.,1
We were on the flight for 13 hours. Within the first 2 hours they had served an evening meal with a cold drink They then brought around coffee After that the lights went down and that was it. No water or anything to drink the rest of the flight.,0
I was a little concerned about flying with Air Canada after reading some of the negative reviews on here but I should never have been. I flew on flight AC851 on the 18 May 2014 and I have to say the cabin crew on this flight were absolutely great they were helpful friendly and cheerful in their work and nothing was too much trouble. They made our flight enjoyable! Food was good for an airline seat comfort was good and although there were some delays before take off this was due to Heathrow ground staff and no fault of Air Canada.,1
Male to Perth via Kuala Lumpur. The airline rescheduled our ticket and sent an email with the new itinerary. Upon trying to speak to a customer representative we get this virtual assistant to chat with which keeps on sending automated response based on what we were typing. Then we are send on another page but the page keeps on loading. The airline cancelled our original flight and gave us a transit of 20 hours from KL to Perth. we asked to be given a hotel to freshen us up but they kept on sending us from here to there without any concrete actual help. We emailed them but no answer about the accommodation.,0
"The absolute the worst flight I have ever had. Will never fly in this terrible airline that nickles and dimes you to death. The seats are uncomfortable, the delay going was an hour, coming home was 4 hours, vouchers given were not accepted for food in the airport. Turbulence was terrible. Staff were borderline rude. Spend the money and go to Southwest or any other airline.",0
Unbelievably bad. Communication dramatic. There was no communication between the transfer where you have to hope to reach your plane. Transfers from Amsterdam to Azores are not met all the time which resulted in continue missed flights.,0
Hamilton to Abbotsford. Crammed in like sardines. Don't even offer a glass of water and charge for everything. The flight fare might be cheapish. Then cancel flights less than 18 hours out. Contact centre can't be reached despite FAQ showing that is how you fix it. Say they book on earliest? Sunday 4 days later? Despite Fri flight being available. No recourse for any added accommodation costs. Would give them 0 stars.,0
"Milwaukee to Washington. Disgusting. Flight out of Milwaukee on June 9th was moved two times, by several hours and ended up being a red eye, because they forgot they needed a first officer for a scheduled flight. Agents at gate C23 in MKE said there are no other options and no compensation. And I could not be routed to another airline because they don't have a contract. Their supervisors were rude, gave me a phone number for a closed customer support, and when I told them I will tweet about my experience, one of the supervisors said he could care less, as Southwest PR department will take care of any negative comments. This is the third time Southwest has completely messed up my work this year without any follow up or customer service. Three of three trips. Southwest no more.",0
Gatwick to St Petersburg. I was slightly apprehensive about travelling with Rossiya Airlines but need not have been! This was full flight from Gatwick to St. Petersburg on an A319. The plane had seen better days but was clean. When I checked in I asked for an aisle seat and was denied one. Boarding was very quick and I soon found myself in a rather uncomfortable seat for the just over 30 min flight. The cabin crew were very nice people and efficient. The service included a complimentary sandwich and drink which was appreciated. I plan to visit Russia again in August and will gladly use this airline. The friendly staff won me over. Disembarkation was via a bus transfer to the main terminal.,1
Travelled from Sydney Australia to Tokyo Japan planes were new and clean food was excellent airline staff were immaculate and friendly for the budget price we paid you can't go wrong with this airline.,1
"Los Angeles to Taipei. As a mother travelling with infant, it was really hard time to keep baby feeling comfortable and didn't disturb to other passengers. But the flight crews helped me too many things during the flight. I do appreciate the cabin staff help. I would recommend about China Airlines. Good Service!",1
Bangkok to Kiev. The airline canceled my flight 3 days before departure and does one of those forcing you to call their overseas office to get a refund or rebook. Then a day later sent me a 'are you ready for your trip email'. It's very confusing and frustrating to deal with. I would not recommend this airline as I did not have a positive experience with them.,0
"We decided to use Easyjet to fly back to the UK from Krakow and arrived at the airport in good time. We flew to Krakow with Ryanair and had all our documentation to hand and everything went without a hitch. We did notice that some passengers did not have a Locator Form but the Ryanair staff simply gave them blank forms to complete and there was not any problem. Our flight with Easyjet proved to be very different as we were returning home we thought that a Locator Form would not be required and there was no early indication of this from Easyjet ground staff. As we were checking in the Easyjet staff asked for our locator forms and bluntly told us to complete them online. This meant filling in a lengthy form and also finding the 2 day PCR test reference number, which we did with some effort and succeeded in checking in just in time. We were last on the plane and others who failed to produce a locator form missed their flight. Easyjet ground staff were completely indifferent. There was no indication given at any early stage which would have given us time to leisurely complete the paperwork. This was in marked contrast to Ryanair staff who made the flight effortless for everyone.",0
"I enjoyed my flight from Helsinki to Bangkok with the new A350. In economy class the seat comfort was good, service was great and attentive, especially by the Thai crew members. Meals were above average and the wifi service was adequate for my needs. One important thing for me was also the cabin air quality which was the best I have ever had in an airplane.",1
Booked Shanghai to Xiamen flight on 28th December 2013 at 2.15pm. Checked in and settled in the business class lounge. As soon as we heard the flight started to board at around 1.45pm we started to move out of the Business Class lounge and made our way to the gate. It was a long walk so we got there at 2.00pm. Behold the plane was already starting to reverse! Asked the gate agent they said our luggage had already been taken out so we missed the flight! We had to book on to a different airline as we were going to a wedding that night. So stay close to the gate when catching flight in China even if you travel on business class. Will avoid them from now on.,0
Ft. Lauderdale FL. to Greenville SC. and back. Both flights on time. Crew professional and information from flight deck twice during flight. Clean aircraft. Would fly again and would recommend Allegiant Air.,1
We booked a family vacation from Indianapolis to Montego Bay via Toronto on Air Canada. The airline cancelled our upcoming flight and will only give us a credit to use for each of our 6 people to use in the next 18 months. I have requested a refund.,0
"They have changed my time of departure 3 weeks before my flight without letting me know, I missed my international flight, spent extra 1500 euros because of that, also another flight had 12 hours delay, we lost our paid hotel because we weren't able to get to the hotel on time. They are extremely unprofessional, useless and rude. Don't want to pay me compensation even if its clearly their mistake for not letting me know for reschedule timing of mine confirmed ticket.",0
"The worst meal I ever had on a plane! We had a 13 hour flight and they offered us one meal with overcooked pasta and ketchup instead of tomato sauce, one tiny kit Kat and one mediocre sandwich! I have been using the airline for many many years and they always offered 2 meals and a sandwich and the meals always had a vegetarian and non vegetarian option. Now it was only overboiled pasta with ketchup! Also there is no legroom for a person over 1,50m!",0
Athens to Rome. Awful behaviour from the cabin crew. Impossible to understand announcements in English. I'm 1.85m and the seat was too small even for a 2h flight. Snacks were good but the beverages less than mediocre,0
"Brussels to Sofia. I am flying since many years worldwide and I have never been seated so miserably. Absolutely avoid sitting on a window seat in the back of the plane, especially if you are taller than 1.70cm and weigh more than 90kg.  I felt like being pressed into the space between the seat in front of me and the frustrated passenger in the back of me. On the ticket they print ""The National Symbol of Flying""  what a bad joke, never again!",0
"Amazing flight with Norwegian from Birmingham to Malaga and smooth from start to finish. Check in quick and they even took our hand luggage, so we didn't have to carry that around the airport. Can't praise then enough. Hadn't heard of them before as its been 4 years since I last went away, but will use them again.",1
"Charlotte to Minneapolis. Delta has failed to get me to my destination in a comfortable and timely fashion every time I have flown with them. The most recent fiasco was my flight from Charlotte to Albuquerque. Less than an hour after taking off, the captain comes over the speaker to tell us that the cabin pressure system had malfunctioned and to remain safe we had to stay at 10k feet and divert to Cincinnati. We were informed that we all had to deplane and was told it would be a few minutes. After a half hour of no information, I finally talked to the customer service. They informed me that it was going to be another hour. The hour passes then it's two hours. Then three. I talk to customer service to see what I could do about missing my connection. I was given 3 options have a six and a half layover to wait for the next plane, fly back to Charlotte and try again in three days, or give up and get a flight on a more reliable airline. On top of this awful situation, in the past I have been snapped at by customer service, delayed four and a half hours because a kid puked in the aisle, ignored by chatting FA, and left stranded in another country for 18 hours. Do not trust this airline to get you anywhere in a safe or timely manner.",0
My wife and I flew return economy from Melbourne to Auckland in August 2013. Very comfortable and clean aircraft. More legroom then Qantas or Jetstar. Staff were friendly and helpful throughout the flight. Check in was easy with no issues at either Melbourne or Auckland.,1
On both my flight to Tampa Bay from Newark and on my flight from Newark to Tampa Bay I was assigned a seat away from my pregnant girlfriend and was unable to move my seat. I guess the only way to make sure you can sit with your family is to pay a hefty fee.,0
"I had a daughter with a wheelchair with me and I found them extremely helpful, we had connecting flights with another airline so I could compare and KLM were the best with helping with my daughter, did not make me feel like a burden or troublesome at all. All the staff I met from checkout to cabin crew and in Amsterdam airport were super friendly and helpful all the way. I would definitely travel with them again and would especially recommend if you need special assistance.",1
"Los Angeles to Jakarta via Taipei. The trip was so easy from LA to with short layover to Jakarta. The first flight was about 14hrs, I was in economy class and even here who can feel so attendant quality of airline. Especially cleanliness of WC. I am tall and leg space was good so I could sleep without any problem almost all flight time. I used them also on the way back from Jakarta to LA, same great service. For the price they offer from LA to many destination you get top quality.",1
"When we flew out of Victoria the staff were amazing, we had one check bag and 1 personal bag which we get for free, so no additional fees. The whole experience from Victoria to Calgary was amazing. But on the return, Calgary to Victoria it was absolutely horrible, the check in staff were rude, and charged us for our personal bag. When booking we are told to be there 3 hours early, so we did. Only to find out the check was closed, we had to wait for an hour. So check wasn't open until 2 hours before take off. The check in staff were absolutely rude. I am not sure I would fly with them again, yes it's great savings but I rather pay more then deal with rude condescending staff.",0
Got to airport just to find out they had decided to cancel flight excuse given was flight was delayed for too long even though 2 more flights flew out after ours. Offered no accommodation and told refund would take 6 weeks this is the second time this has happened within a month on same route Gold coast to Sydney at 8pm.,0
"On this occasion my partner and I experienced a 3.5 hour delay with BA. There was no communication at the airport, nothing until we got onto the plane where the captain told us delays were due to a bag that had not been checked in correctly at Heathrow. Because of the delay when the plane finally arrived it had no water on board and was not permitted to fill up at our destination. This meant disgusting toilets because of no flush and no warm drinks on board. We were sat on the runway for an hour because the engines would not start. We had no aircon for 40 mins. When we finally got back to Heathrow the captain told us that he was sorry for the issues.",0
"A very mediocre experience. For a 13 hours flight, they provided passengers with a hot meal and a snack. The plane was dirty, my entertainment system worked once in a while. They charged us an additional 70 EUR for the seats but changed them offline. Their service in Mexico city is a joke and never answers calls.",0
San Francisco to Singapore via Guangzhou. A very joyful flight with China Southern Airlines. My husband and I took this company for cheaper ticket than other airlines. After boarding the flight attendants arranged luggage for us. A Boeing 787 aircraft with the latest entertainment and business class configuration. The cabin crew told the connecting flight info that let us pass the customs quickly. Also the reason we choose China Southern is the great transferring issues in Guangzhou. Of course the cabin service and meal was satisfactory.,1
London to Sydney via Dubai. Tuesdays on QF2 are usually quiet and the Premium Economy cabin was less than half full.  Nothing to report save the usual level of service and courtesy that one expects. I may be biased towards Qantas being a gold FF but they have upped thier game. One gripe and it's nothing that can be done on this flight. It lands at around 5 am. So breakfast is served around 3.15am local time. Personally speaking the thought of eggs and sausage do not appeal but breakfast has to be served so there it is. Coffee and fruit was enough for me. Suggestions to Qantas? How about a daytime flight back to Sydney like the old QF 32. That way one can enjoy it. At the moment one travels through a short night leaving London and a second night through to Sydney.,1
"Hong Kong to Jakarta via Kuala Lumpur. During 4 legs of my journey, 3 are delayed. As we rush in the airport to go to the next leg, there is no notice about our next flight being delayed thus prompting us to rush even though we should not need to rush. During the delay, there is no compensation. The flight attendants is far from friendly. They seem to be more apt at ordering people around. The seating is cramped. They wanted all electronics to be switched off, not just on airplane mode during take off and landing.",0
"Jaipur to Bangalore. Just before 4 days of journey, we got message that the flight got cancelled. For further processing, we tried to call their customer care numbers. But as usual, there is nobody in other side to receive the call. Now because of their worse response I am forced to book ticket in another flight by paying three times of actual cost. But still so far there is no call or mail from GoAir about apologize or sense of fault. Consider if customer is in some critical situation, how would he reach for help. As per me, if possible, we should avoid using this airline, who doesn't care for their passengers.",0
Having travelled to Cyprus with a large wedding party we weren't even sat anywhere near each other on the plane. The planes were old tatty and cramped. At Larnaca airport there was a massive queue to check in so 4 of us decided to part with 40 Euro for express check in. We ended leaving the desk at the same time as our friends who took the long queue. When asking the reps why this is acceptable they advised 'it's the risk you take'.,0
I've been flying Qatar airways all the times and this is the first time I use Emirates. I had a horrible experience. The food is really bad and the service is terrible. The staff are not helpful at all. Many seats are empty but they don't allow anyone to use them. They kept them empty the entire flight which was 16 hours. I will never use Emirates again.,0
"Brussels to Baltimore via Keflavik. Book this airline from their website and avoid the nasty surprises. There are several levels of ticket class, and many of them include checked bags and extra legroom at a fraction of the cost of buying it at the airport. This is a no frills airline, but my ticket was half price of other carriers, so I am OK paying for water, food, and internet separately or bringing what I need. Absolutely worth it. Don't book through a travel site offering super low prices, or you will be met with hefty fees for everything. Book through their website, and it lets you know what to expect.",1
"They left my luggage in Jeddah, arrived in Amman not good customer service, and they said will deliver my luggage to the hotel but lied. The next day I want pick up my luggage at the airport they make it hard.  I believes if that reviewing all the service will bring improvement, especially with their human resources quality.",0
"They just lost my checked luggage and it is disappeared since 7 days. No one replied to any email, they don't pick up the phone and I am running out of my prescribed medicine. I hope they will come up for all the extra costs I am having now and I hope they start to feel any responsibility for my lost luggage. Sadly I can't give less than 1 star. It's a shame and I am really shocked this airline is like this.",0
"Auckland to Manchester via Dubai. Never travelling with this airline again. They clearly overbooked, and delayed my mums flight by 10 hours, whilst my flight was still ok to go ahead. Used the excuse ""Not enough time to board on the transfer"" but for some reason my fight was ok. We were booked to go on the same flights. Had my mum waiting 10 hours in the airport, with no complementary food. Not impressed with the service at all. Customer Service Helpdesk is based in India, so good luck, if you ever have issues with them.",0
"Zurich to London Heathrow with Swiss. The ground staff were very unhelpful,  but onboard flight the cabin staff were wonderful. Short flight and I'm not crazy about the European business class arrangement with the middle seat left empty, but no extra leg room provided.",1
"This is my first and certainly my last flight with Frontier Airlines. Yesterday flight from San Diego to Denver was delayed a few times, consequently I had 3 hours of sleep last night and am now sitting in Denver airport, flight back home is again delayed. No announcements being made as least to give updates except the short initial one with reference to ""aircraft maintenance"". Terrible service, praying that I arrive safe home.",0
"Warsaw to Lisbon. The staff were really nice, attentive, always ensuring everything was fine, but without being pushy. A true example of how service should be. Food was very good as well. I had some issues with my ticket, which got resolved by calling the support line. Although I had to call a second time to ensure everything was OK.",1
Flew Liverpool to Belfast with easyJet. Worst service going! Didn't inform us of a 1 hour delay until they had boarded us including a screaming child. Made us stay seated for 1 hour plus whilst they waited for an extra attendant. No drinks or anything. Why not leave us on the airport! Common sense would dictate that. Plane was full of screaming kids getting impatient. Full marks for easyJet on poor services and how not to run an airline. They knew the staff member was sick the night before so why not the issue then?,0
"Taipei to Vienna. I find the service in Business Class worth the money. The friendliness and readiness to serve you is very good. The seat is one of the most comfortable seats in business class. The food, especially the breakfast, is very good and tasty, champagne and wine was excellent as well. IFE offers you a large screen and is very responsive. The variety to choose from was also more than enough.",1
"Berlin to Tel Aviv via Belgrade. Horrible experience! Terrible services and ignorant rules. Our flight was delayed twice for several hours. We did not receive any service or information. I've tried to cancel a return flight, but nobody bothered to rely my messages and emails. When I called, then they just said I should wrote an email.",0
I paid 150usd for a ticket from Danang to Kuala Lumpur but ended up paying another 150usd because they said I chose the wrong baggage type. They have the worst customer service!,0
"New York to Denver. I travel cross country at least twice per month with Southwest or JetBlue. I tried United Airlines on the last trip. Never again. The plane was unkempt, the Internet was spotty at best. No other form of entertainment. Older plane. Extra charge for luggage. Change fee was exorbitant. So many better choices.",0
"Athens to Brussels. The quality of the service is getting worse. I regularly pick this operator for my flights from Brussels to Athens and back. During my last trip not only we faced delay, but also the information provided was not accurate. They did not clearly communicate the reason of the delay and kept on stating that the flight will leave at 18.00 although it was 5 minutes later.",0
Frontier is the worst airline I have ever flown. Over priced baggage fees. Delayed flights. Just horrible. Flying out of Las Vegas we had 3 gate changes which made it very difficult for my disabled husband! Checking in for our flight was a total nightmare. I will never fly with Frontier again!,0
Jet Airways is a third class airline. I booked the ticket from Ahmedabad to Mumbai but after 2 days I got the message that they cancelled the flight for operation reasons. So I called customer care executive with holding line 1.45 hrs and make arrangement in another flight. Unluckily that flight was also canclled with same reason and arranged for another flight. Same thing happened 4 to 5 times. Finally last flight also canclled with same reason.,0
KLM cancelled my flight as the pandemic started and said I can get a refund. I requested the refund in April 2020 and have still not received it after years of following up. Shocking service and all I get is the same copy and pasted response when I follow up on it.,0
"I was yelled at by several ground crew between entering the airport and boarding the plane, for issues that were caused by the airline. Onboard the experience is ok, but I can only imagine how bad it would be if you had a significant issue that required Customer Service on the ground.",0
"New York to Manila via Incheon return. The staff were polite, prompt and speak in great English. The downside is sometimes they passed over me when handing things out. Perhaps this was because I was in the window seat or maybe it was just me. But I would like to see better responsiveness. The food and drink is plenty and frequent and delicious. There's a wide variety of beverages from beer and wine to tomato juice. The facilities were clean. For the 14 hour flight we were given blankets, toothbrushes, toothpaste, pillows, headphones, and slippers. The media selection was excellent. They were one of the cheapest airlines I found. ",1
1788 CLT to ORD. This is definitely the worst airline. Every flight is delayed. Never taken off on time in the last 3 years. Add to that the rude staff at the counter who usually don't have any information. They keep blaming everything on 'inbound aircraft.' And this is at the hub Charlotte where they have plenty of aircraft's to redeploy.,0
"London to Boston. Amazing flight without a problem, arriving on time despite a little late departure. Seat confort was great for economy. Back of seat was very good and leg space seemed above average... seat confort on this A380 seemed better than Emirates A380. Crew was great, available and with special attention to kids.",1
"This is the fourth time I've driven 1.5 hours to the airport to get thru security and have AA cancel my flight, leaving me stranded, having paid a lot of money for ride to airport, dog sitting etc, i cannot express my outrage. How are they allowed to continue mistreating humans like this and not somehow be penalized. Its not the weather, shouldnt they have to maintain some sort of quality so as not to cost me thousands in losses from having to redo my plans each time? I'm forced to fly them due to the rural nature of where I live. They are consistently 100 percent horrible.",0
"Cancun to Cleveland. I was on one of the canceled flights on Sunday, April 3rd, 2022 from Cancun to Cleveland. I know this happens. But, the Royal Oasis Resort where we were all given a room is beyond reprehensible. From the cleanliness to the food was totally unacceptable. I had dirty sheets and holes in my towels. Is that somewhere you would put your family? NO. I paid for a nonstop flight and comfort plus seat, I ended up a day later having a lengthy layover in Houston. There really should be compensation for this. Extremely disappointed in United Airlines. I will never refer anyone.",0
"Paris to Shanghai via Guangzhou. Very positive experience with China Southern. My sister and I have booked a return flight from Paris to Shanghai, via Guangzhou. Unfortunately, due to the typhoon, our return flight was compromised. Fortunately for us, a staff found us a solution very quickly and was able to give us another flight ticket to Paris, same day. This kind of staff service is what makes an experience with an airline company very positive. We'd recommend this company anytime, for their services and their willingness to help very quickly.",1
"Chicago to Athens via Rome. Excellent flights both ways from Chicago to Athens. Our connection was held in Rome so we made it on time. Staff was very nice, food was excellent, and seats were comfortable. My family and I are going to Greece again hopefully, and we would fly Alitalia for sure.",1
"Our family was all traveling together and we had several issues that needed to be addressed at check in. The Delta employee who assisted us was absolutely wonderful. We had luggage issues, my daughter needed to change part of her itinerary, and we were traveling with a pet that does not fly regularly. He was very knowledgeable and professional and handled everything very quickly and efficiently. Outstanding service!",1
"My baggage was delayed. I filled out the baggage delay form right at the airport. The Air Canada agent promised it to be delivered to my home address the next day. I can see in my status online as if my baggage was delivered, but it never did. I tried to reach their argent by phone and waited more than 3 hours on the line and no one replied.",0
Houston to Colorado Springs. Flight was delayed due to an issue with the emergency brake. It took 30 minutes to figure this out before they made everyone get off the plane. Said it would be up to an hour delay. Eventually they switched planes. After 1.5 hours we boarded the new plane. We sat on the runway for about 45 minutes before taking off. Terrible experience with United Airlines. Would not recommend flying with them.,0
"Detroit to Orlando. With all that is happening with the corona virus and travel restrictions, Spirit will not refund any money. They only allow you to use it for future flights within a 6 month time span. They over charge for everything and have a horrible customer service department. Pay they extra money and fly with literally any other airline.",0
"Lisbon to Seville. I paid additional money to be seated near the front of the plane but was given another seat when I checked in on the flight. I was not even told about the seat change therefore did not realize until I was on the plane. To make matters worse, they gave out the same seat to someone else. I had to wait until everyone was boarded until I could actually sit! I was not the only person on that flight this happened to. This will be the last time I fly TAP. No one even apologized.",0
"Toronto to Entebbe via London with British Airways. I was quite impressed with British Airways, they were fairly generous with the amount of food they offered as well as the selection of inflight movies and games. The staff were never rude or unprofessional and the flights were all on time.",1
"I flew London to Ankara via Istanbul, and it is difficult to put into words how bad Turkish Airlines is. Their customer service desk at Istanbul seems designed to annoy as many people as possible in as shortest time as possible. We missed the connection because the first flight was delayed, and then I spent three hours in a line waiting to get a new flight. Despite having a business class ticket, I was turned away from the Business lounge and had to wait in the main terminal. The attitude of every Turkish Airlines staff member I spoke to was appalling.",0
Dalaman to Manchester seat 19a. No legroom whatsoever. I felt so cramped I nearly had a panic attack and it's not something that's happened previously. Lots of passengers saying the same. I won't be flying with them again easyjet and Ryanair much better.,0
"Grand Rapids to Newark. Worst customer service ever. I will not use United Airlines again.They have nothing good to offer besides a cheap flight. My luggage was destroyed and they said they were not responsible. The ac unit on the entire plane was out, nothing was offered. And on another flight my chair was broken and wouldn't stay in one position. Super uncomfortable ride. I definitely do not recommend.",0
"London to Dubai. From 1st March 19, Emirates have decided that when purchasing a business or indeed first class ticket using reward miles, that traveler will be treated very differently to a ""paid"" ticket holder, in that they will not be provided with chauffeur drive. Quite appalling that Emirates feel the need to save money by penalizing its most loyal customers! To add to the insult, Emirates will not even honor the service on tickets purchased before the rule change.",0
"Dubai to Bangkok with Thai Airways. The best service I have ever had. I can't remember when everything was so excellent in an airline, and it was with Thai Airways. The service is outstanding, cabin crew always have a smile in, they act very quickly on your demands and provide solutions immediately. The food was amazing, one of the cabin crew even brought me a Thai dessert just because I was curious about their culture. The seat was really comfortable and the entertainment very updated. I am definitely flying them again.",1
"United is a class show, and particularly business class. However, they took it up a notch with the outstanding service of Miroslav. He was every bit as professional and focused as most United flight attendants. Still, he found a way to take great service even farther. He paid close attention to how he could make the flight better. He went out of his way to offer ice cream, drinks, and food. He had a number of guest to attend to, but he interacted with each of them and did so without seeming rushed. The food on the United flight was great and the business class seating was fantastic .. a real joy to fly for nine hours straight.",1
"I bought a ticket from Goa to Delhi, canceled the flight the day before departure, without explanation, did not return the money on request, pure deception, never fly this carrier please.",0
"I flew this route from Taipei to Penang a few times and always with China Airlines as it is the only company which offers this direct connection. However, it is always a painful experience, except the staff who is nice, the rest is really poor starting with the plane itself. It is a miserable plane with much too little space for a 5 hours international flight, this type of plane is usually used for domestic short flights only. Then there is no individual monitor and you have one poor movie playing for the all flight on a common screen. The food is low quality and this flight is usually always late ""due to the late arrival of the plane"". Only one thing is high is the price. It is actually so bad that I considered taking a Cathay Pacific flight with a stop in Hong Kong to not fly in this flying sardine can.",0
"Provo to Santa Ana. Our return flight was cancelled and we had to scramble to find a flight home with another airline. This cost us a lot of money and a lot of stress! Also, we were only given about one fourth of what we should have received! My family will never fly Allegiant Air again. Lousy way to run a business.",0
"Got us late both ways. Also caused us to miss a following train. Saw confusion on their bags policy. A guy paid for it but they didn't allow him baggage for some reason, which wasted everyone's time. At arrival in London on return flight, they didn't open gate for 30 minutes after stopping the plane.",0
Bought my ticket at a very cheap price. I love flying on this kind of plane. Simple and not much passenger due to limited number of seats. Our flight departed 30 minutes early. It was a flight nothing to write home about but the price was the game changer. Overall it was a good flight considering the situation we are all in.,1
"I write this as I sit on the tarmac in Houston 3 hours after we should have left. I understand delays, no problem. However the disorganized operation is hard to ignore. Getting answers like, ""the plane will board once the arriving plane is empty"" or ""we'll take off as soon as they finish fueling"" are a little frustrating. After sitting on the Tarmac for about 45 minutes I asked for water and was told the would charge me in flight for my water. I questioned that they charged for water and was told ""Spirit Airline charges for everything"". Never again.",0
"This is about the 4th time I have flown Jetstar star class. If you know what to expect then you will be happy. If you want lie flat beds and all the trimmings then you are kidding yourself. My flight on May 10 from Melbourne to Bangkok was great. Check in staff were grumpy, but I got over that. The seats are comfortable enough for a daytime flight with plenty of legroom, just not much recline. The food was good, not up to some airlines business class but not too far off it. Wine selection and quality was good. The Thai staff were very good. The cabin is only 3 rows for star class, smaller than I have had in the past, but that is good as you get better service and no queueing for the toilet. We were first on and first off the plane. Qantas Lounge in Melbourne is okay, but needs a refresh, a bit tired compared to say Singapore or Hong Kong, or even Los Angeles. Overall I think it is a good deal and an alternative to Qantas premium economy, which I would rate about the same, which makes sense as the cost is similar for routes of the same length.",1
I flew from Rio de Janeiro to Turin via Rome FCO. The long flight was made by a brand new A30 with a very good on board entertainment system and a quite good service. Both planes were clean and both flights arrived at destination 15 minutes before the schedule hour.,1
"Lyon to Cagliari. The flight was on time and the service was as expected. No complaints and the price was excellent. Perfectly adequate for a low cost airline. The Euro 5.00 to purchase an extra 10kg luggage allowance was very reasonable. We purchased the Combo plus package that provided checked baggage, priority boarding, basic snack and booking flexibility. Very worthwhile.",1
"First, the flight was 3 hours late from nyc to Lisbon, which happens. Second, when we arrived in Lisbon we missed the connecting flight because they post gate numbers about 20 minutes before the flight a takes off. by the time we reach the next flight it was too late. Third, they placed us in the next flight to Toulouse, but because we missed the connecting flight out of no where the company cancelled my returning flight a few minutes later. Thank god, i had the presence of mind to check my email to see it. Fourth, I had to get back to a long line  to fix the problem. The desk person who was very nice, didn't understand why they did that but managed to fix it. Fifth, my luggage didnt follow me even though while i was rebooking the next flight, they guaranteed me it was going to be in my flight. I called all the numbers to try to locate my luggage and every time i spoke to someone they gave me a new number to call. They don't even transfer you, they give you the number you have to call. Most of them take about 30 min to pick up. Finally, its been 5 days and i'm still waiting for my luggage. i keep checking the online checker but i get the same message every single time. I am very worried because their site says that they usually manage to locate a luggage within 72 hours. Overall, this company is the worst i have taken so far and i travel twice a year for the past 25 years.",0
"I wasted a trip to New York. I booked Jetblue Airways flight from  Orlando to New York, as I thought they were good. The delays totally wasted this trip to New York, and I will never fly with Jetblue again.",0
"Perth to Melbourne. The filthiest plane I have ever been on. The seats weren't even brushed for crumbs and sand. There's also absolutely no room for your small carry on items, not even a water bottle or purse. Extremely long wait at every point of checking in and boarding. Will never fly with this carrier again, not worth the small money savings.",0
"Very attentive, courteous and helpful staff. Good food, but the portions could be slightly bigger. My favourite airline as I have flown with many other airlines in the past but none of them beat the quality of service I receive from Qatar Airways. I am absolutely always excited when flying with them as I have never been dissatisfied.",1
"United made traveling during the holidays a nightmare. My husband and I flew out Christmas Eve and flew back New Years Eve and both experiences were terrible. Both had layovers in Chicago flying from Kalamazoo to Denver. The flight out got delayed 6 hours. We updated our connecting flight due to the delay and were supposed to have an hour in ORD before boarding our plane to DEN. However, our United flight spent half an hour searching for a gate causing us to almost miss our connecting flight. Additionally, our checked bag was lost and had to be delivered. It was also not delivered at the time it was promised. On our flight back, we got out of DEN fine, but arrived at ORD at 12 and with our connecting flight leaving at 3.45. Due to United's incompetence, we were stuck in the airport on NYE until 6.10 and did not make it home until hours after we were supposed to. It was 2 miserable days of traveling and United offered nothing to compensate for these errors that ruined our holidays. Do not fly United if you actually wish to get where you're going even remotely on time.",0
"Wasn't the worst flight I've been on, I'll say that. But when you arrive 2 hours early and your flight gets delayed and you arrive at your destination and they not only forget to put my checked luggage on the plane but half a dozen other peoples luggage on the same flight might I add, is just plain ridiculous! Yes I understand it happens, but not to eight different people on the same flight. I fly a lot and out of all the airlines I fly, this has been the most disappointing! My boyfriend and I checked our bags at the same time and his bag arrived. ",0
Have used Onur Air for the last 2 years. Flights on time aircraft fine and have had less legroom with other airlines. Take your own food and drinks as in flight snacks and drinks require a second mortgage.,1
Flew Milan Linate to Amsterdam. I always fly with Alitalia and have never experienced a problem on board their aircrafts. Cabin crew very kind and flight is always on time. Their airport lounges are very nice and the food is very good. I've also flown business class and can just recommend flying with them. Their club MilleMiglia works very well.,1
"Sydney to Berlin via Singapore. They denied me to fly and would not make any concession to rebook me, losing me not only their cheap flight but all the connecting travel. I have traveled twice to Europe in the last 16 months using my passport that was water damaged on a hike in New Zealand two years ago. No immigration offices in New Zealand Germany England Italy Sweden And Australia have flagged it and the officious duty manager would not let us check it with the anyone in immigration. I understand the airline can get in trouble if they let a damaged passport get through. But on return to Canberra where I thought I would have to apply for a passport from scratch because it was so damaged, it was fine for just a renewal. We were not the only people having problems we watched a family brought to tears by one of the other booking agents. No food, no water, no service, no power,no Tv, no blankets,no pillow, no baggage, no care. No flight for me.",0
Hong Kong to Beijing flight was delayed for 40 mins. The seat was comfortable and food was great. However there was no personal television screen.,1
"Hong Kong to Wuhan with Cathay Dragon. The food and wine is great! The seat is very comfortable. Though it's a very short flight, the seat allows you to lay down as much as possible. Cabin crew are friendly.",1
"Flying Delta was a great experience, as the cabin was modern, power was provided, and personal entertainment screens were provided even on this domestic configured aircraft. Delta also gave us more free snacks and drinks than most US carriers, and the entertainment system had a large amount of content. PDX is a great airport, and so is MSP Terminal 1. Great experience in bringing me back to a frozen, wintry Minnesota.",1
Auckland to Hong Kong. Cabin crew were friendly and helpful. They offered drinks and snacks throughout the flight. Toilets were maintained and I was  impressed with the IFE. There was a wide selection of movies and TV shows as well as radio channels. I appreciated the seat chat function as my companion and I were seated apart during the flight. I also like generous leg space of the cabin.,1
I traveled from Kuala Lumpur to the Gold Coast on a rather full Air Asia X flight. I was able to sleep a little bit on the flight. I will fly them again.,1
"This airline is a joke. SF just placed mandatory 10 day quarantine in place for anyone flying into SF. Booked tickets less than 24hrs ago because my mom just passed away and now we cannot fly. Frontier supervisor would not refund, stated had to file a claim and stated no guarantees of a refund. I will never recommend or use this airline again. Shame on you heartless people.",0
Horrible company.  I originally checked my car seat stroller at the gate. Once we arrived in Atlanta they said they were short staffed so the sent my car seat and stroller through the baggage claim which took 2 hours. My stroller got stuck in the door of the oversized baggage and I took pictures and called. The customer service supervisor said to wait until they called me back which made no sense to me. I called for a week straight and even uploaded the pictures only to get an email saying I did not report the issue within 4 hours. Waste of money. Do not fly with them.,0
I travelled from Sydney to Gold Coast return complementary tea coffee water or juice was available. Very comfortable seats in economy and pretty good leg room. The flight was excellent takeoff and landing was very smooth. I very much enjoyed the flight and the crew were very friendly. I will definitely be flying Virgin Australia again. Highly recommended.,1
"Malaysia Airlines from Kuala Lumpur to Perth. Old aircraft showing its age. Drink service consisted of a tray of water or juice, not the normal trolley with a drinks selection. Anything else was by special request. I asked for a beer and it was bought after the tray of drinks service had been completed. Mid flight snack consisted of a bag of peanuts and another tray of water and juice. I requested a gin and tonic and it was provided, once again after the tray service was completed. The flight attendants were happy to provide this service when requested. Food was inedible. Offered was fish and rice or chicken and potatoes. Worst food I have ever been offered on a flight on board a full service airline. No wine offered with lunch. The state of the toilet can only be politely described as unhygienic. What was once a great airline seems to have lost its way since reverting to Government control and cost cutting management! In my opinion Malaysia Airlines is now only slightly better than a ""budget"" airline but with a full service airline fare structure.",0
"flydubai is a low cost although depending on the destination not so low cost. But it's the only no frills airline that has individual entertainment monitor on each seat. I think it's the only low cost with such a perk and it's quite unique for its category. Flew Bahrain to Dubai. Rarely on this airline have I had flight delays. T2 in Dubai has been totally renewed and it's now a jewel. Good thing compared to other terminals, it's much faster to get out from airport. Overall it's good value for money for most destination and it's my preferred choice nowadays. One small suggestion. I have once purchased the food tray and food was quite average. While sandwiches are decent.",1
Paris to Barcelona. Definitely the worst airline I have experienced. First of all we were meant to board to fly out at 10.05am but the flight then got delayed without any notification on the gate screen until 15mins later. They said gate changed so we all went there and then delayed the flight again another hour. But on the email from Vueling it delayed us to fly out at 1pm but the gate officers said they were still scheduled to fly at now 12pm. There was no communication between the airline and gate crew. The gate crew even said the airline is not communicating well. Now I have missed my next connecting flight.,0
"I came to airport on April 8th and been told that my seat was taken by someone with flexible date of the flight and early check in. I've been promised to get refund back to my card in next 48 hours.  I clarified few times. Its money on the card, not voucher? I've been told yes, money on the card. They were asking my payment method. To assure me I'll get my money back for issues policy of company caused me. After 48 hours ! I texted to letstalk flydubai and later on connected to client hot call. I've been told by policy of the company I will get my refund only like voucher. And if I will continue this topic, all my messages will be considered as review. Its absolute disrespect.",0
"Pleasantly surprised with Jetstar. We are life members VIP of Qantas and only heard bad things about Jetstar. However our daughter who arranges our travel said try it. We were impressed. The staff were great, food excellent and good selection. The seats were very comfortable and while not lie flat beds they were still good. Well done Jetstar.",1
"I booked a 4 leg round trip with Lufthansa a month ago. A week back I got an email notice that they have cancelled the flights in 3 legs of the 4 leg round trip. They gave me an option for an intermediate leg that starts about 6 hours later from Frankfurt and options to cancel it and ask for a refund. I cancelled an intermediate leg as it is of no use as I cannot magically transport myself to Frankfurt and have my luggage automatically loaded in the aircraft for an onward journey. When I clicked refund my ticket, it errors out on their site and asks you to contact their customer service. I have been on hold for more than 2 hours on three separate occasions and yet unable to get in touch with their customer service. An email sent to their customer service to process my refund came back with a canned response from a DONOTREPLY email address. I have started the process of disputing the charge through my credit card company because according to their flight cancellation email I am entitled to a refund, just there is not way to request a refund online or via phone. I have searched online and there are numerous customers with the same experience.  Spare yourself the headache of forced flight cancellation and inability to request refunds.",0
Booked a flight in October 2019 to fly in September 2020. Covid came and our government refused to let us travel. Delayed and later cancelled our flights. Asked for a refund and were told that it had been processed. Asked when as it hadn't been received and was then told in a lengthy email that because our flight had been cancelled by them due to adverse weather conditions we weren't eligible.  Went back again with facts about our interactions but have not heard anything since. Can't access our original booking on their website. Escalated to Danish Transport Authority as per SAS website but they can't help as we cancelled the booking. Will never fly SAS again. Their customer service representatives don't read your email details and just send standard replies !!,0
"I do not recommend American Airlines. I had the worst experinec flying from LA to Dulles Washington. At the airport in LA they made my life miserable because I had my laptop along with my purse and back pack as a carry on. They told me that laptop is considered an additional bag and I have to shove it in my backpack to give the illusion that I am carrying 2 bags. On top of everything returning from Philadelphia I had a carry on bag full of glass souvenirs. They wanted me to check in the bag due to no overhead space. I had to empty my carry on to remove all the glass items for me to carry them on to the plane. Lord be hold, I walk on to the plane and there is plenty of room above. I have traveled a lot and never encountered such an unorganized company. I will never recommend or fly with this airline ever again.",0
"I called SAS and waited over a hour and 30 minutes to only be met with hostility by the phone representative and hung up on before she address my concern. I started the call with my name, reference number, and a request for a refund or voucher to rebooked the flight. This woman decided to say no to everything and refuse to let me speak to a manager. After I already let her know that I looked online to rebook to a later flight, she proceeded to say the policies won't book more than 12 months in advance. I let her know that I could not see any flights online at all. Then she says she can rebook it but would not tell me the first dates available in 2022 to travel. She kept talking over me, very rude, would not answer my question and ended the call without telling me dates available. Completely unprofessional and I will be sure to hold this company and that employee responsible. I was fine with rebooking my flight, but now they completely lost a customer and future customers as result.",0
"I booked several trips thru Europe with Vueling. The first leg was on July 1st 2015, starting from Orly Paris to Prague on 9.55am flight, arriving Rome at 12.00pm with a connection to Prague at 1.00pm. We arrived at the Airport 2 hours ahead of the flight time to find extremely long lines. Vueling process all flights thru a single line. We made it thru the line 7 minutes ahead of the departure time. As they checked our luggage and processed our boarding passes they advised us that there was no flight that day to Fiumicino airport where we have our connecting flight, but that it was diverted to Ciampino. Told we can pick up our luggage there and connect to our flight to Prague. The flight left 30 minutes late, arriving in Ciampino at 12.30. Transportation between the two airports is a bus that leaves every 15 minutes after the hour and the travel time is about 30 minutes. It was impossible to make the connection. Since the flight was scheduled to Flumicino our bags were labeled to that airport. We tried to pick up the luggage at Ciampino to find only one bag delivered and the other one lost. We took a taxi to Fiumicino hoping there may be a later flight to Prague, to find out Vueling has only the 1pm flight. We had to wait in a line for four hours to talk to a rude agent, that advised us that they would put us in a hotel and provide transportation to and from the hotel. We headed to the airport the next morning at 9am to catch 1pm flight. After 30 minutes in line we were advised that the flight was delayed to 4.30. Since I had the time at the airport, I went to Vueling lost and found, and fortunately I located the bag. While waiting for 4.30 departure, Vueling announced that the flight time was changed to 2.30 pm! We hurried to the gate to catch the 2nd bus transporting passengers to the plane. We waited in the bus for half an hour before they told us that the flight time had been delayed again to 5.40pm. The second boarding at 5.10 was manual since all the electronic boarding passes were collected the first time. In short this low cost airline, made us spend 36 hours connecting in Rome rather than 1 hour.",0
"Jeddah to Riyadh. My flight was supposed to be 1200 but I'm still in the terminal. Because of delay. What makes me upset are that they never made an announcement about this delay and they removed the flight info from the electronic screen so we have no idea when the adjusted departure time. Because of no announcement and no info, all of us have to proceed to the other gate to ask Flynas ground staff and the way they answer me is so rude.",0
"Cologne to Palma. I was asked to check in my bag because the flight was full. My bag did not arrive with the flight, along with the bags of half the other passengers on the flight. Because I was waiting for my bag, I missed my connecting flight to Barcelona. I had to reach for my sisters graduation so I bought a new flight for 115 Euros. The wait till the new flight gave me time to lodge a complaint for my missing luggage. 4 days later I got a phone call to confirm my address for delivery of my bag in Barcelona. I requested them to drop off the bag a day later as I was out of Barcelona on a road trip, to which they agreed. That night I got a call from a hotel in Barcelona saying my bag had been delivered to them by mistake. I called Eurowings and asked them to correct the error. The next evening when I called the hotel my bag was still at the hotel, so I went and collected my bag from there. Not only did Eurowings forget to carry my checked in bag on the same flight I was on, it cost me a new flight, 5 days without my bag and personal belongings, and then lost my bag once again!",0
Karachi to New York via Dubai. Best flight I have experienced. The staff was very nice and cooperative. They have the best entertainment system with the latest collection of movies. The food is okayish and better than many airlines. The planes are also new. I should mention that Dubai Airport is the best airport I have visited.,1
"Fort Lauderdale to Nassau. First of all, late as usual. Air conditioning did not work. The mask policy is outdated. When are you people going to get your act together. Nothing in the Bahamas works smooth if it even works at all.",0
Our flight from MAN to JFK was cancelled due to engine issues which resulted in us having to rebook and we ended up flying via LHR. Our rebooked flight was with British Airways which was much better as they offered individual inflight entertainment systems unlike American who are still on an old system of overhead TVs. Our flight back from JFK was delayed and when we eventually got on board the aeroplane was quite possibly the oldest plane I have been on with a cabin crew to match. After 10 minutes the pilot informed us that a member of American Airlines staff had attempted to open the cabin door when it had already been locked which resulted in the life raft falling off the plane! We had to all disembark and after an hours wait we were told our flight was cancelled and we would need to rebook. We were put on flight the next day via Dublin which resulted us being over 24 hours late home. Appalling service and we will never travel with them again.,0
Paris to London. Really enjoyed flying with Air France. The aircraft was clean and looking new. Boarding was very organised and all cabin crew were polite and professional. Sandwiches and beverages were offered during this 40 mins flight.,1
"I flew from Auckland to Guangzhou on 18th December with China Southern Airlines. The cabin staff were great and cared about my requests. Good communication and response. They cleaned the lavatories. They asked us if we need more water, juice or soft drink and asked how we felt about their service. It was the best time that I have experienced China Southern Airlines. It would be better if they have cabin WIFI.",1
Have a nice short flight with Spirit Airlines from Orlando up to Newark New Jersey. The usual budget travel and I traveled with under the seat small bag. They had scanners for tickets which moved people along quickly. The pilot kept us informed of developments. He included warning about keeping the seat belt on since we might get some bumpy weather.,1
"Booked trip for honeymoon and purchased extra leg room exit seats. Our seats were switched to middle rows and not together. Qatar has no customer service, phone support says you have to talk to them at the airport, when you talk to them at the airport they say you have to talk to them at the gate, when you talk to them at the gate they say they cant help because you have to do it at the check in counter. Then they say they can only help you if you send an email complaint. I did that and 2 months later still no response. At this point just trying to get the money back from the ticket upgrades that they did not honor.",0
"This company for unaccompanied minor is the worst by far and yet they charge you 150 dollars for it. My daughter had a direct flight from Orange County Ca to Atl Ga and somehow got diverted to another airport and no one contacted me, I was sitting at the airport waiting for her when I got a call from her freaking out cause she landed in another airport and she doesn't know why and no one told me anything. After speaking to a manager in the airport from Delta, she told me that my daughter is fine and to calm down she will get there when she gets there and that the weather was so bad that they couldn't land but all the other planes seem to be landing just fine and there was no rain, no black clouds it was clear as day sun shinning and 95 out. But the weather was so bad they landed somewhere else and then didn't contact her mother ever even after they sat there for 3 hours. On top of that my daughter was on the phone crying and the flight attendant told her to stop crying and that she was fine and freaking out for no reason. Thank god there was a Mom sitting behind her with her kids who stuck up for her and reassured her that it was going to be ok and that she was there if she needed anything. We fly with southwest and pay 50 dollar unaccompanied minor fee and have never had an issue they tell us if they are running late or even when she has had a not direct flight and they land and change planes the flight attendant will text you and let you know all is well. I have contacted them but I just do not want another child and parent to go through this don't fly your unaccompanied minor with Delta.",0
"Cincinnati to Austin. I was excited about the cheap price but it doesn't make up for how bad the customer service was. The Allegiant employees working around the terminal were unprofessional and rude. When I asked the guy at the gate a question about whether I could purchase an 'early boarding' pass at the gate, he seemed flustered and then rude and eventually just blew me off. I was trying to make an additional purchase and he turned me away for some reason. When I arrived in Cincinnati the Allegiant folks took 60 minutes to start loading our stuff onto the baggage claim thing.  I will not be using this airline again, even with the cheap price..",0
"Our booking from Kuala Lumpur to Kota Kinabalu was for 17h30, got email that delay until 19.30. Checked in 16.30 and went to departure area. By 19h00 notification of another 1hr delay. 20h45 no official communication but flight staff member informed us that entire flight crew for our flight had been rerouted to another flight. All AirAsia staff disappeared and at 21h00 an announcement over public address system informed us that flight was delayed until 02h40. At customer service cubical in departues there was one AirAsia person with a queue of at least 50 customers waiting to be served. We then went home, no point staying in KK for 30 hrs as our return flight was at 15h00 on Sunday",0
Madrid to New York JFK. I had a very bad experience with them. They lost my luggage. They said when it went missing that it never made it to the plane. They located it and will deliver in 24 hours. It has been 3 days now and no one is answering us.Their customer service is below mediocre.,0
Absolutely appalling customer service. My flight was cancelled and I was told I would get a refund. Literally years later my case was closed with no explanation. Finally got hold a human through live chat to be told my refund has been rejected. Again no explanation.,0
"Seattle to Fairbanks. Outstanding customer service as always. Final leg of my flight from Tucson, AZ to Fairbanks, AK. Previous flights were with American Airlines who across the board were not very helpful. What set Alaska Airlines apart from the rest is their ability to tell customers what they can do, verses reiterating what they can't do. Alaska Airlines is flexible and values their flyers!",1
"Tunis to Doha. Flying with Qatar Airways A350 Business Class was something that you must have once in your life. Everything was as expected, from boarding to Cabin and flight entertainment until the finest details. But in Doha my luggage came out So late, even with the priority sticker. It was damaged and didn't realize it before reading the hotel room. I wrote a claim to their Baggage services. Even after sending many reminders you only get replies with ""we are investigating "".",0
"Sioux Falls to Chicago. I used to fly United often, until their performance became intolerable. Every now and then I fly them out of necessity and I am reminded why I need to keep avoiding. This flight departed an hour late. Upon arrival we waited another hour on the ground for an open gate. Save yourself the pain and stay away.",0
"New Delhi to Kolkata. Delighted with the prompt, efficient and warm onboard service provided by the crew. Appreciate their efforts towards customer centricity.",1
Athens to Ankara via Istanbul. The reason I purchased a ticket this time with them is because it was suppose to be a direct flight. Months later they email me informing me that it would not be a direct flight so I was stuck with this ticket. My flight was suppose to only take 1.5 hours from Athens to Ankara. As of this point I am still waiting and it's already been 10 hours and I'm stuck in Istanbul airport.,0
Seattle to Vegas. We accidentally reserved our flights wrong and Deanna  and Adrian helped us out tremendously. We are so grateful they were amazing and truly blessings. Thank you guys so much,1
"Terrible. On the way home, from Halifax to Hamilton, flight was delayed twice, then rescheduled for the next day at 8 am, then delayed again until 11am. I had other family heading back from Halifax 2 days later, and there flight was delayed aswell. They're a great airline to fly with, so long as you don't have average expectations, and you don't care if you're on time. Another thing that is extremely inconvenient is, there contact number that shows up on there website is directed to Calgary, and there office doesn't open until 8 am, mountain time. Depending on where you are in Canada, if you have a last minute emergency and you need to talk to a representative from Swoop, you're on your own. I'll pay the extra money, and fly with someone else next time.",0
"They expect you to pull your mask up between bites of food while you're chewing and remind you constantly. One flight attendant in particular was wiping his sweat on his gloved hand and touching everyone's cups and ice, etc, yet my husband's mask fell down for a split second while he was talking and the guy instantly yells ""pull it up, over your mouth and nose"" as he was pulling it back up. He also stood over my 21 and 23 year old daughters while they were eating to make sure they were pulling it up between bites. Every few minutes they come across the loudspeaker reminding you to keep it up no matter what even in between bites or you will be removed from the plane. We are adults, we know the rules and we don't need a constant announcement disrupting us throughout the flight and airline staff using intimidation tactics while practicing disgusting and unsanitary behaviors themselves.",0
"Midland to Lafayette via Dallas. This was the worst flight I have had. An older female stewardess berated me in front of everyone twice, once for not knowing it was not free seating like my pleasant flights on large Southwest aircraft, and again when I asked what type of cookie, she rolled her eyes and tried to shove it at me, very rude. The next flight the male steward called me out on overhead mic cause I had to use restroom.",0
"Worst airline ever, got charged 4 times on small suitcases, end up even paying for my bags on my way back from Philadelphia to Phoenix and missed my flight, and didnt refund my money on my carry on luggage. Worst ever, please dont use this airline. I had to buy another ticket.",0
"Worst airline experience. From the moment you book the tickets till you get off the plane. I booked a seat and paid for it, when I board the plane, my seat was changed to the back of the plane. Check in employees were dead slow. Seat Space does not exist and they don't recline. The airline tries to rip you off all the time, through hidden costs are everywhere e.g. water bottle could be part of your ticket which you will pay but never receive, and check in costs.",0
A wonderful flight thanks to flight attendant Gabriel. He was the most kind airline employee we ever had and we appreciated his attention to our children,1
I am waiting for my international flight as we speak and I have never been on such a disorganized airline! After passing several gates and several metal detectors and waiting in several lines I wanted to sit relax eat and wander around and shop until my flight. Unfortunately that is not happening because we had to go through an additional line baggage screening pat down and talk to more people at their kiosk! We could not have our water that we just bought inside the gate area and now we are stuck in a roped off area at our gate unable to go out and have lunch or a drink of water! I am so frustrated if only they had checked all of our stuff properly at the gate entrance there would not be this problem of waiting and not being able to leave. This is the first time using Philippine Airlines and I will not be using them again.,0
"I travelled from Manchester to Barbados return. Both ways they ran out of choices of meals. When I questioned why I was given a curt reply. The staff came across as very indifferent to passengers needs. If you want a drink after your first initial drink we were told that only one drink was served due to some passengers drinking too much. As a 50 year old travelling eating a meal which I did not want and refused a glass of wine due to other passengers"" maybe"" drinking too much is quite insulting. The final straw was they had run out of drinks and apologies were made to passengers that there was no more drinks on board as they had no room to store drinks and other passengers had drunk too much. Is this the service you expect on a well known airline? More training needed maybe? Is it because it is economy?",0
Detroit to Montreal. Honestly the worst experience ever. We had a flight from hspan to Detroit then to Montreal. The Japan Detroit was great people were amazing but once we got to Detroit everything went down. We asked if we can move our layover flight earlier as delays started to appear they said if it's not 90 min they can't or we have to pay 400 usd in total for a flight change. We decided its not worth it. So we took our original flight next morning which has been replayed since 5 am. Its been delayed with no explanation again and again. The staff at delays usa is completely rude. Do not answer questions i mean who is training them? Do they even get training? I am literally still sitting here waiting for a plane which is so stupid because I am only 1.4 hours away from Montreal. Horrible. 1st time ever using them and last time ever.,0
We were supposed to fly out of Ottawa to Orlando last Saturday the 15th Feb at 6am. We got to the AP at 3am boarded the plane around 5.30am and then were told to exit the plane because there was a delay. Needless to say we spent the entire day sitting in the airport and didn't board until 7pm that night. We missed an entire day of our vacation because of this. Will never fly SW again.,0
I flew on QF1 Sydney to Heathrow mid July 2014 Business class. This flight was fantastic all aspects were up to Qantas's usual standard including the inflight entertainment choices. Being able to watch the Kerry O'Brien interviews with Paul Keating again was a very pleasant way to pass the time. Food and wine were fantastic and the crew personalised the service by using my name this is a nice touch and not all airlines do this. Qantas has the A380 configured as 2x2x2 which is not as good as the 1x2x1 of Singapore airlines but the mattress topper made a difference and the seat became quite comfy for sleeping. All in all a good experience.,1
QF 28 22nd April. Qantas experience in business class between Sntiago and Sydney was just excellent. Food was great seats brilliant and service was punctual friendly and professional. Can't fault Qantas on this service.,1
"Having flown with Emirates and Eithad, I was looking forward to a good service from Gulf Air. This was my first experience flying with them and probably the last. The food served was horrible. The air stewards and stewardess could not speak clear English hence, were rude to most of the passengers who could not understand what they were saying. They were not very efficient or attentive to passengers. I had to call them twice to be given a blanket since it was very cold onboard. The inflight entertainment movie selection was very poor when compared to Emirates  who have a better selection. ",0
"Paris to Santiago de Chile. Great flight. The aircraft was looking new and clean, economy seats are quite comfortable and the inflight entertainment screen is larger than others airlines full of music albums and movies. Flight attendants were friendly and professional, the food was not bad. Definitely flying with Air France again.",1
"AirAsia Philippines has thus far refused to refund the sum of a cancelled flight back to my bank account, even though it promised to do so. Out of all airlines I have used, this one seems to be the worst. There are no words for the lack of service I have received after putting so much trust in them.",0
"Vancouver to Tokyo. This is our first time flying ANA and what a delightful experience. We flew JAL last year in Economy and Business Class and it was a huge disappointment. On our flight in Economy class was 3x3x3 across in seating and we were in rows 29 and 30 GH. Even when the seat infront of us was reclined, there was still ample space and we did not feel closed in at all. The plane felt new and very clean with a fantastic entertainment selection of top run movies. I had time to watch almost 4 movies, Hollywood selection along with foreign speaking films in Korean, French, and Chinese. The cabin crew that we had was fantastic! Everyone was so friendly and helpful and made us feel like VIP unlike other airline crews that you feel did not want to help. The crew always had a smile and extremely friendly. As for our meals, we chose the hamburger salisbury with potatoes and it was delicious. It had 2 cold appetizers and both were excellent. One was like an imitation crab salad and the other an aspic with spinach. A french red or white along with a white sparkling wine were offered as well as sake. Our second meal was a tuna croissant with a yogurt and apple slices. The mini tuna croissant was also very tasty. We really enjoyed our flight on All Nippon from YVR to HND as the plane was so comfortable with great air quality and not too hot in the cabin. The seats were not all cramped together and perhaps it is because it is 3 3 3 across iso so many planes now at 3 4 3 across. We will never fly JAL ever again as it is so inferior compared to ANA. We will definitely be flying with ANA in the future.",1
Phoenix to Denver with Frontier Airlines. Absolutely terrible. Never again! Understaffed at the check in desk. They charge you for every little thing. They forgot everyones luggage that checked a bag for the flight. We had to walk outside when the plane let people off and then go to the baggage office to find out how to retrieve our luggage. They have gone downhill!,0
Rhode Island to Orlando. Terrible. I am done giving JetBlue chances. There once was a time where JetBlue was the best and affordable airline but now all they are is an unreliable airline that can never get their flights out on time.,0
"Flew London Heathrow to Naxos via Athens. This was the first time I have flown with Aegean and I was very impressed. Check in at Heathrow was speedy and painless and all the staff were helpful and smiling. The plane was clean and new, food and service excellent and staff really seemed to enjoy their job. The return journey was as good. I will be flying this airline again if they are on my route.",1
"On my flight from Denver to Knoxville was delayed by almost 3 hours. Which is not my problem with this airline They lost my luggage on Saturday, July 30, 2016. After two hours of trying to to find someone to assist me and about 9 others, they said there was nothing they could do and we would not be able to get our luggage back until Monday and refused to send the bags on another airline. Monday night I received a call saying they would deliver my luggage to my house. By Tuesday morning it still was not there. I tried calling the number they gave me when I filed my lost luggage claim multiple times with no answer. Finally, got a hold of the lady that had called me monday night and she said she would have to get back to within an hour. 3 hours past and she never called back and would not answer my calls. Finally got my luggage back, but I would not recommend this airline to anyone. There is no customer support and terrible customer service. I'm usually pretty understanding, but this was absolute absurd. There was no effort on their part to help me or even try and reassure me that they would be willing to fix the issue at hand.",0
"An abysmal customer service experience. Trying to reach a person for help is nearly impossible, they force you to communicate solely via chat with an automated bot that is of very little help. If you are persistent, you can get through to what they lead you to believe is a human but I have my doubts. They have no interest in attempting to retain a customer in any way shape or form, the default answer is no. I was unable to make a booked flight due to rapidly changing travel plans during Covid times. I hoped I could get some kind of credit for booking another flight but they were unwilling to consider the option, which is certainly their right for the fare booked. One would figure they may have some kind of repeat customer loyalty flexibility or the ability to provide any shred of empathy, but that is clearly not the case. Lesson learned, avoid this airline at all costs.",0
"I was traveling from Las Vegas to Louisville on flight 5456 on Aug 19, 2020. While in the waiting room waiting to hear my number, I noticed the two Pilots of this flight come out and talk with the wheelchair customers, after which they then pushed their wheelchair onto the plane. I was never so touched by what these Two Pilots did. I have never seen this before and will never forget it. Thanks to Southwest for another reason I only fly this airline.",1
"San Diego to Baltimore. While one of the worst airlines I've ever used, including a horrific experience 10 days ago that landed me on Alaska Air to San Diego, this particular flight was relatively worry free. The service at bag check, boarding, and inflight were good. The seats however are the least comfortable of any domestic carrier. I'm willing to sacrifice some comfort for price, but I'll never choose to be that uncomfortable again.",0
Riyadh to Amman. Worst service ever. We entered the aircraft preparing for the take off then the captain announced that the plane had a problem and it will take 10 to 15 minutes. We stayed inside the plane for 3 hours. That was the worst experience ever.,0
"This is only the second time I've flown in my life and I'm 65 years old. I have a broken back, asked for wheelchair assistant when ordered tickets but In TRI cities they were great on top of everything. But coming and going to LAX. Charlotte Airport American airlines was no help at all. I had to walk both trips for 20 min ... couldn't find anyone to help me get wheelchair and i was in so much pain I thought I was going to have to call rescue squad. Very unprofessional.",0
"Early morning flight Manchester to Amsterdam. I was sitting in seat 2F in Business Class. Flight departed nearly half an hour late due to the weather in Amsterdam, but we arrived ahead of schedule. Very comfortable trip and service from the cabin crew was superb. They served a delicious breakfast, which I enjoyed. I cannot recommend KLM highly enough.",1
"Toronto to Vancouver. Flair lost my bag. We got the bag after two weeks of waiting. Flair never returned any of my emails, not one. You are not able to talk to anyone in the baggage department. I received one phone call saying they found my bag and it would be delivered the next day via Fed Ex. I asked if they can guarantee that it would be there the next day as I am leaving the country and need the bag before I leave. They said it would be there 100 percent. The bag did not arrive the next day it arrived four days later as Flair did not give Fed Ex an address for my bag. I luckily had a name tag on my bag which Fed Ex was able to contact me with. Flair lost my bag twice! They also lied about the delivery date. I will never use them again and do not recommend them.",0
"New York to Guangzhou with China Southern. It was a long flight and I have two small children, so travelling is not easy. The staff was very accommodating and helped us. I had to hold my son while my wife ate, and they kept meals ready and warm for when I could eat them. I chatted with them in the back while holding my son occasionally and found them to be personal and helpful. Thanks for a great flight experience. It's not easy for us with little kids on a long trip and they made it so much more enjoyable.",1
"This airline drives me insane! I often travel at short notice and take my small dog. When booked through an agent online there is no facility to book and pay for my dog. I call and when I manage to finally speak to someone I have missed the 48 hours notice for pet in cabin which agents do not specify on their sites. Long story short they dont reply quickly to emails nor calls so now I have to take pot luck and take my dog to the airport with me and chance it that can pay and board the flight with him. If I cant I have to return without taking my flight, unhelpful responses and wont be booking with Germania again.",0
"We found a great deal from LaGuardia to Rome via Atlanta on Delta and could not pass up the opportunity. This flight was very good. The IFE on the plane was great, with lots of selection and high quality. Flight Attendants handed out earbuds to use for the screens and the plane was in good condition. A blanket and pillow were provided as well. We ordered the kosher meal and everything tasted good. The cabin crew were very nice and service was quick. I recommend Delta for long haul.",1
"Solidly good trip, with perfect departure and arrival times. Professional and friendly personnel, comfortable and quiet cabin, a number of small arrangements to make me feel that I was being taken care of as an individual. As on the inbound trip, I will not give full marks because the toilets were not clean at the start of the trip, and were then not inspected during the trip, which made for a couple of unpleasant surprises.",1
My Wife and I have used various Airlines in USA fairly extensively over the years. First time on Alaskan and can only highly recommend them. Service from check in Kerbside to arrival destination was perfect and should ever we visit USA again will use them if opportunity exists.,1
"From Hong Kong to Shanghai with Spring Air. Flight delayed a first time and we waited 1 hour on the tarmac before take off. From Shanghai back to Hong Kong, boarding was delayed for more than 1 hour without any explanation. Then we waited on the tarmac for 1 hour before they told us that we weren't going to take off for another hour. Didn't they know that before we boarded? Or is that a way to sell their disgusting food on board? All this happened after they canceled the flight I was supposed to take and left me with no choice but this flight. Total waste of time, you should absolutely avoid this company, it is not even worth the money. Or take it only if you have absolutely nothing else planned during the day.",0
Customer service does not give me the proper information and retract what they had originally told me in regard to flight changes. I purchased insurance through travel company which was useless as they don't hold up to what their selling. I had to pay almost 300 to change flight. I rescheduled the 2nd flight and they wanted to charge me again for a full flight fare. Basically over 1300 dollars to fly return from Vancouver to Winnipeg.,0
Terrible airline. The staff review documents multiple times and give imprecise instructions to passengers. No call to announce departure and seems like purposely want passengers to miss the flights. Worse experience with an airline.,0
"I had great flying experience through out my trip. How ever your customer service which I have been trying to get hold of for 38 days has been simply so disappointing and honestly disturbingly horrible that I will never fly with KLM again. They lost my bag in San Francisco 38 days ago. I filed claim then I kept calling spend 7 hours on hold! Then I filed restitution claim, tried WhatsApp, Facebook, Instagram, Facebook Messager and nd not once have any Customers service agent reached out to me.",0
Flew to Bangkok from London Heathrow on 13th March. First time I have ever flown with BA normally fly long haul with Virgin but they don't fly to Bangkok. We were offered upgrades in the last few days for big discount but only on the flight out. World traveller plus was very good with fab leg room and comfy seats. Nice food too. Managed to sleep 5 hours in quiet cabin. But if I had paid normal price then it was not worth the extra money as we found economy seats on the flight home were very comfy and good leg room. The plane was older 777 but not problem. very clean and the staff were attentive. I was nervous because of previous reviews but no need to be as we had a very enjoyable flight.,1
"Booked a flight ticket and was canceled right after. Didn't receive cancellation confirmation and full amount charged. Upon speaking to customer service penalizing for processing the cancellation. Not helpful, unresponsive and not listening at all. Ridiculous.",0
"Budapest to Eindhoven. The day before our departure we tried to check in online however after a few steps the website blocked. We tried several times but we never succeeded in performing the check in since the website kept blocking. At Eindhoven airport they were understanding and we had no issues. For the trip back from Budapest to Eindhoven we experienced the same issues with the online check in on their website. No understanding at all at the Budapest airport however. We were treated very rudely and were obliged to pay 45 euros a person for an ""Airport Check in"". We were 4 people so we had to pay a staggering 180 euros for 2 minutes work by they employee. I can only urge you not to book with Wizz air since it is a total rip off.",0
"Worst flight, delayed two hours to clean plane, was told I would be able to connect. Missed Spirit Airlines flight and stranded in Chicago. Had to purchase flight from another airline. Spirit Airlines has not given a refund. Worst customer service, do not care for their clients.",0
Shanghai to Tel Aviv. I chose Hainan Airlines because of reasonable departure time. Flight attendants have a good service attitude. Bedding service is provided. They told me the arrival time and the ground temperature in advance. The airline also provides us with pajamas and toiletries. The entertainment facilities on the plane are complete. My air travel is very comfortable.,1
"Worst airline in India, they will cancel your ticket any time and offer you a full refund before 2 days of departure date. After that if you check for a new flight to book you will need to pay 3 times more than you got as a refund amount.",0
"I used to like Avianca now it is just a disaster, the service is horrible, the attendants are rude and seems to be against the traveler, even they now don't offer anything like water and snacks the sell everything but they dont even have a complete menu to offer.",0
They are not responsible and do not care about their customers. They haven't approved a cancellation of my ticket since 2 months now. Also there is absolutely no one taking the responsibility. The flight timings were changed and I cancelled the ticket due to that. I have no idea what is it gonna take for them to respond to their customer.,0
"Flew from Miami to London. First time on the A380 and was a little surprised how unremarkable the experience was because you board via 2 jet ways the boarding was no longer than a 747 or 777. The World Traveller Plus area is on the upper deck and BA had divided the class areas into smaller spaces so losing the scale of the aircraft. The seat were comfortable and spacious even when the seat in front was fully reclined on the over night flight you still had space and room. The service was the usual British Airways, the cabin crew being friendly and interactive. Overall a good quick flight and would definitely recommend BA but will stick to the 787 which I really love",1
Spirit is a scam. Its approach is to make you believe you are getting a deal but there is a charge for everything and the seats are so uncomfortable unless you purchase a a big seat. I was going to my graduation on a simple flight from Fort Lauderdale to Orlando which should have been a simple flight however both flights were delayed over an hour coming and going within two days. I missed my graduation exercise because of the terrible service!,0
"Worst customer service ever, my food was disgusting and had to pay for drinks on transatlantic flight. Cabin crew were rude to me. Worst airlines ever",0
"Spirit Airlines are a joke. Flew from Houston to Cancun. Delay after delay. Flight today that was supposed to leave at 11.20, now 4 hours later we are getting on the plane because they had 1 staff member as a no show. Offering nothing in compensation, when I have already paid for a hotel. My date is waiting at the airport with no news on my flight, waiting for me to get there and can't do anything. Thanks Spirit for ruining my entire day of vacation and offering no help.",0
"I flew to Nashville via a connection in Houston. The first flight a 60 seater was overbooked by 7! The gate agent was totally overwhelmed. When I said I might ""volunteer"" to give up my seat she asked what the code for Nashville is. Agent came on and off the plane a dozen times before we finally left 15 minutes late. Return flight from Nashville to Houston was cancelled and the robot computer rebooked my for 5.40am the next morning. All flights on original travel date were overbooked. Got to Nashville Airport and half of UA's Expressjet flights were cancelled or delayed. Every gate had the wrong flight posted and they reshuffled right before departure. Aircraft taxied for 15 minutes then sat on the runway for 20 minutes. Not one word from the cockpit. Upon arrival in Houston we sat for 10 minutes until someone showed up to pull up the boarding bridge.",0
They are so disorganized and can't seem to make a flight on time. No one seems to know anything and they just have you sit on a plane for an hour for luggage due to them causing a previous plane to be late because they chose to argue with a customer about a mask instead of just remove the customer. Therefore screwed up the entire flight and just left us for an hour on a plane for 10 pieces of luggage. Do not fly Southwest.,0
Second Journey to Tokyo from Copenhagen with SK0983. Unfortunately there was a 2 hour delay but there was good flight information and journey took only 10 hours from Copenhagen to Tokyo. Good Entertainment selection and Food was a great improvement from last journey 3 months ago. Staff always professional and helpful. I have travelled With SAS the last 30 years I must say all in all that I have always experienced good service and flights With SAS.,1
I took the flight to Kolkata on IndiGo. The web check in was done smoothly and it must be noted that the seats at the rear are cheaper as compared to those in the front which is strange as they are the same seats.  The baggage drop was done quickly and efficiently at BLR airport. And boarding started well on time. The crew were welcoming during boarding which was good and the arrival and baggage collection was also Swift. Overall an uneventful flight which took me from point A to B without too much fuss.,1
"Ottawa to Toronto. My first flight was cancelled, the airline said that it was plane trouble. I was bumped to a later flight and we landed 20 minutes ago. We are still sitting on the tarmac not moving waiting for a gate to pull in. This is terrible service. We have landed more than 20 mins ago and no one will tell us anything or get us off this flight.",0
"Milan to Tel Aviv. Good European Business class with separate cabin and full business service. 16 Seats in configuration of 2x2.  Air crew was  professional, nice and welcome, food was good. WiFi worked well and it was free.",1
"LaGuardia to Chicago. I was appalled to find out that unlike every other airline I have ever flown, American makes passengers with infants wait and board at the back of the plane. Clearly they care more about their premium passengers than families and is no longer a family friendly airline. I will never fly American with kids again.",0
Gatwick to Malaga. Excellent flight no delays comfy leather seats 32 inch seat pitch in economy compared to Thomson and Easyjet and it was a cheaper fare. Cabin crew attentive. After inflight sales they advised passengers to use call button if anything was required.,1
"Guangzhou to New York, we get good care of flight attendants. The ground staff made process fluently that we can go on board on time. The inflight service was far better than I imagine, professional cabin service and relaxing surrounding inflight. Almost 15 hour flight I slept almost times but the cabin crew provided meal for me after I wake up and served the hot water we asked.",1
"They are the worst airline! I will never fly interjet again. Let me begin by saying we paid for a straight flight but a week later they change the flight There was a 2 hour layover coming and going. They lost our checked bags going from JFK to Mexico city to Mexico Cancun even after we asked multiple interjet staff If we need to pick the luggage up and register it again. So there we were in Cancun on our honeymoon with no clothes for 2 days straight. When we called we could not get anyone who spoke English and when we finally did he told us it's only been 48 hours and then once the bag was found they wanted us to come pick it up or pay them to drop it off. After a lot of back and forth they agreed to bring us our bag at no charge. On the way home from our trip Cancun to Mexico City, and Mexico City to JFK we were told that we needed to go get our bags so we did. When we got down stairs we were told by a different staff that the bags are carrying over. Because we had went down stairs like we were told to we were not allowed back up stairs and had to go through a long line of security again. We did not know where we were going so we asked a interjet staff representative. They helped us get to our destination then asked us for money. The guy said my time is money and told us to get him some money out of the atm. We gave him nothing and kept walking.",0
"We were on flight CZ3822 and CZ343 on 9th December from Nanjing to Melbourne via Guangzhou. The first flight delayed for 2 hours and we couldn't catch up with the second flight to Melbourne. China Southern Airlines arranged us to stay at a hotel overnight and catch up another one next morning. Service on ground and on flight were both great. Their staff were patient, thoughtful and responded to our requirement promptly.",1
"My first time flying with Bangkok Airways and I was in for a pleasant surprise. The service was really friendly and efficient. Good food was served on this short hop from Bangkok to Vientiane. All requests were attended to promptly and with a smile. Overall, a very good experience.",1
"Again a horrible experience with Delta. After several terrible experiences that I personally had made in the past my family now got to experience the extremely poor customer service of this airline and its total disregard of its customers. My family came to visit me in CO from Europe, travelling Munich to Denver via Atlanta. After massive delay they arrived in Denver with 2 bags missing. We were assured the bags will arrive at my address the next afternoon. We had plans for that day and couldn't do anything but wait for the bag delivery. The bags finally arrived at midnight. One bag was severely damaged the other one completely destroyed. The pieces of the bag and its damaged and broken content were delivered in a plastic bag with a handwritten note that the bag was run over by a truck. We filed a claim with Delta online and received a confirmation email that they received our claim. After two weeks of no further emails from Delta we called several times to be updated on our case and how to proceed. Very poor customer service, extremely unorganized. Finally we were told that it will take 4 weeks for Delta to review the case. No apologies or anything. My family's vacation thanks to Delta wasn't the most pleasant experience. I will never fly this airline and never recommend it.",0
"Business Class on Lufthansa is amazing, and cabin service among the best I have experienced. The food is good, wine is good and the entertainment also very good. The only thing I would note about the bed is that there is less room for your feet compared to some other flat beds, but is otherwise very comfortable.",1
Bloemfontein to Johannesburg. I fly SA Express frequently because my company books the tickets not out of choice. Today again there was a problem with the aircraft. Resulting in a smaller aircraft been used for the route. The knock on effect was 17 passengers being bumped of the flight. The supervisor at Bloemfontein admitted they have a serious problem with aircraft availability. I will avoid flying with them when possible.,0
Terrible flight to and from Greece. Freezing cabin and rude stewardesses. Food worst I have tasted. Seats very uncomfortable asked for blankets and was asked if I was sick? We had exit rows and they would not turn down the air conditioning. The entire plane was freezing. Then when we arrived in Montreal to connect to Toronto they said the flights were cancelled and they would have to see what they could do the next day. My son had taken another flight and was left waiting at the airport in Toronto for us. They were not willing to help or guide and people were scrambling to try to get out on a flight that evening to Toronto. Every year we say never again this experience was the last straw.,0
"This was probably our seventh or eighth time working with Frontier within the last year and this last particular time was the absolute worst customer service I have ever experienced. I was on the phone for over an hour and a half just trying to get an issue resolved. I initially booked a flight on my app and when it was time to fill out the pay portion the app said it timed out and didn't go through. I then went online to book it again and the second time it went through. When I was ready to confirm the flight I checked the app and realized it double booked the flight, I called within minutes of finding out and got the run around. Because I didn't purchase ""the works"" bundle when booking it they wouldn't refund me the money. As if I would intentionally double book and spend double the money for the same flight. I spoke with two managers and a customer service rep. I ended the conversation with a manager, I expressed my concerns and told her how great it's been up to this point and still couldn't refund me for the same flight. I will definitely tell everyone I know not to fly with them, and definitely don't recommend the customer service they provide.",0
"American Airlines really dropped the ball here. My flight was scheduled to leave at 5.32 from terminal 2 C11. I received a text notification that there were delays, which was fine. However, I stopped receiving notifications and there were no updates online so I continued to stay in the area of C11. There was another flight leaving from that gate so I spoke to the attendants, who scanned my boarding pass and told me the plane was on route and should be there around 8, then they left and there was no one else around to talk to. At about 9.30 I checked online again and it said that the flight was on time leaving at 9.04 from C21. I found a phone that connected to the airport's customer service, and the woman actually laughed as she told me the flight had already left and I'd need to contact American Airlines customer service but I wouldn't have any luck at that time of night, so try in the morning. I received no notification of gate change, there were no announcements of final boarding call. I was checked in and they had scanned my boarding pass! They can give me that money back, but they can't give me the five hours I sat there waiting, or the experience of my sister's first baby shower or the weekend we had planned together. I will never book with American Airlines again!",0
"Avoid at all costs. Worst airline ever. Every time I fly frontier it gets delayed or canceled. Always completely unorganized, and the most inconvenient and terrible way to fly.",0
"Denver to Detroit. The Spirit Airlines 45 min checking is absurd, I tried checking online, but it asked me to go to the kiosk, then the kiosk asked me to go to an agent. And then the agent says sir you are 9 mins late we cannot issue you a ticket. This is absurd and unfair.",0
"Orlando to Philadelphia. I was trying to get my elderly mother on a Southwest flight to Philadelphia so she would be safe from Hurricane Dorian which was headed towards Central Florida. Regulations did not allow me to help my mother get onto the airplane and into her seat. The Gate attendant was extremely helpful to me as my mother was traveling with her little dog and I was very concerned that she would become confused as she has some dementia and would not be able to find a seat or get into her seat while dealing with her dog and her purse. The Gate attendant made sure that someone assisted my mother onto the airplane and helped her get her dog safely under the seat in front of her. Once all the passengers were on board, he made a point of coming over to me and assuring me that my mother was doing fine on the airplane and that the flight attendants would watch over her on her 2.5 hour flight into Philadelphia. I cannot begin to express my gratitude for his helpfulness that day. He was an angel in disguise and I really appreciate everything he did for my mother and her dog. Many thanks.",1
"Worst airline experience ever. This was my first time flying Spirit Airlines and I assure you it will be my last. Both flights to and from Tampa were over an hour delayed because we were waiting on the pilots. They boarded us an hour before we actually departed so instead of waiting in the airport where we could stretch out, they crammed us onto the plane to just sit there for an hour waiting to depart. Very frustrating that this happened on both flights. Will never fly with them again. Also, no wifi options. They charge for all snacks.",0
"The lady at the check in gate threatened to close the door to board the air plane if people didn't stand 6 ft apart. Only to have us sit inches from each other after we board. On the way back my son was told to turn his mask inside out because it was offensive to the flight attendant. The pilot got us there safely, the only plus to the whole flight.",0
"Worst Airline, even after paying money for all the services. I have not yet received my luggage for the past 1 week and I stranded in a new country without essentials and medicines. This is after taking a 48 hour flight. Pathetic and will not recommend to anyone.",0
"Outstanding! From the warm, smiling welcome on board, this flight was excellent. The in flight crew were friendly, attentive and very professional. Detailed announcements from the flight deck as well. Food and wine all very good indeed. The Premium Economy product on BA is also very good. Comfortable seats, foot and leg rests and decent recline. FR superior to any other airline on other Atlantic routes.",1
"I travel a lot around Europe and generally find flying reasonable given the constraints of security etc. This airline though is a nightmare. If you want to go on a 3 hour flight on rock hard seats with zero leg room, this is the place for you. Also if you don't want to pay extra, then its the middle seat. Wizz Air reminded me of the bad old days of the cattle trucks of the 1970s. If after reading this you still decide to fly Wizz Air, then you can't say you didn't know what you were letting yourself in for. ",0
"I upgraded to Business for my trip back from Darwin to Adelaide on QF1959. From the moment I entered the plane to the moment I departed in Adelaide I was treated by your team as if I was the only one on the plane.  I would like to say thanks to your team who went above and beyond. The care and service in particular from one of your employees Flight Manager Jennifer was amazing, and after seeing her actions in transit with the team and the customers made it clear that you have a special ""diamond"" within your team. As the service industry has perhaps dropped the ball in these times, with people like Jennifer and the team it was the opposite. Please pass on my thanks personally for the service provided. Many Thanks.",1
Lufthansa has extremely rude customer service at the Z terminal in Frankfurt! The lady was disturbed that I interrupted her jesting session with a male coworker and obviously wanted me to know her displeasure. She refused to answer simple questions and said to come back later.,0
"Very happy with Akasa Air services. This is the 2nd time I've flown from Agartala to Guwahati and vice versa and was happy to note that both ground and onboard staff were helpful, courteous and well trained and maintained their standards. They had ontime departure and the aircraft was clean and seemed new. I would fly it again.",1
"New York to Tel Aviv via Warsaw. Do not book a ticket here. We booked flights right before a holiday, and LOT Polish Airlines cancelled the day before our flight. Didn't even call, just sent a vague email for us to figure out on our own. We booked our tickets months in advance and to book a day before is crazy expensive and stressful. Do not use this airline.",0
First flight with Aegean Airlines and found it all very relaxing. The staff were friendly and helpful and tried to give the personal touch. From the moment we checked our bags in we found them to be really helpful. I was very nervous about the stay over and catching the next flight from ATH to RHO but they really reassured me and made sure I felt happy. On arrival in ATH they made the change of flight very stress free. Definitely use them again. So much different to Ryanair who were dreadful.,1
"This was the second time we have flown Vueling in 4 days and thought perhaps the first flight we were just lucky but this last flight just confirmed what a great experience we had. Professional, friendly and accomodating. Printed boarding passes at airport and no charge.  Boarding was a smooth and quick process. Dozens of desks open at checkin so little waiting. Seats as spacious as other airlines. Great choice of onboard snacks and friendly staff. All this with really cheap fares. No comparison with Easyjet, where we were treated like cattled. Would choose Vueling above the others.",1
We flew with from Madrid to San Jose and from Miami to Madrid this month and were very disappointed by the service the comfort and the general attitude of the staff. Travelling with my husband we asked at check in to be sat together we were assured we were sat next to each other. We did not check at the time but found out that we were in opposite side of the plane. The plane is far from being great only a few screens depending on where you are sat you can hardly see the screen. The air hostesses are very unfriendly and not helpful. They hardly speak any English. Very bad experience I usually don't put much importance on the airline we fly with but would avoid Iberia by all mean from now on. Also lost the luggage on the way to San Jose got them 2 days later luckily.,0
"Amsterdam to Johannesburg via Rome. Where does one begin? Send delay information emails and confirmation after it already happened. Poor staff service, very unfriendly. No support to single mothers with children, can't even get receive a bottle of water on request. Everything asked seems to be too much of a hassle or inconvenience for the staff. Refuse to speak another language to some customers while gladly speak the same language to other customers. Will never fly with Alitalia again. Our friends warned us about the shocking service and thought it can't be so bad, but it's very bad indeed.",0
"Flew Pittsburgh to Orlando. I've been terrified to fly with Spirit Airlines for 6 months now. However, Spirit was nothing like the reviews. The flight was on time and we arrived early to Orlando. The staff were all nice and tried to make the flight fun. Nothing about this trip was bad. Just remember there are so many more people that fly than these reviews but the only ones to leave them are the negative ones. Imagine how many people have had no problems at all but don't think to comment.",1
"These people are extremely undependable. They seem to have problems filling their planes so they keep postponing flights until the plane is filled. If you are on any kind of a schedule do not fly with Swoop. I'm currently stuck in Edmonton having suffered two flight cancellations. I am currently over 24 hours late getting back to my job and I am now promised the flight will leave this evening, over 36 hours late so far.",0
"We flew to El Paso and back. on the way back they canceled my flight. I was forced to fight with the counter person until they put us on a United flight the next day. We had to spend the night eat out buy chargers ect. The counter person said ""I will not pay for the hotel"" I don't understand. I contacted AA and they did nothing and will not answer my emails. How do you not answer emails? You can't call because it takes hours to get anyone. Why would anyone fly with them? So all in all this change cost me hundreds of dollars. Also I had to take an emergency day off of work.",0
"No complaints. Super cheap. Direct flight. No delays. As you should expect, ones to pay for checked bags. Absolutely going to fly them again. Old plane, but Newport News airport is easy and everyone was nice.",1
"Brisbane to Sydney. Unhelpful, rude and didn't care about me making my international flight in Sydney. Would not recommend to anyone. The worst flying experience I've ever had. I would recommend flying any other airline besides this one.",0
My trip from Changi to Jakarta was pleasant I choose the seat near the emergency door and the leg stretch is very good. The trip back was nice and smooth it is a no gimmick airline. For me you've got what you pay.,1
"Pekanbaru to Jakarta on Garuda Indonesia, the flight was on schedule, fast check in. The cabin crew very helpful The lunch menu was chicken rice, tasty and they serve it very fast after seat belt sign went off. Landed in Jakarta airport was very smooth. Always enjoy flying with Garuda Indonesia.",1
"Nha Trang to Ho Chi Minh City with Vietnam Airlines. I must give the lowest scores on every ranking that I can for this awful airline. I had to pay douple the price compared with other cheap airlines to ensure the departure time and ended up being delayed 3 consecutive times, which made me cancel my meeting after that. A laugh and short explanation were all I receive from its employees for its delay.",0
"Austin to Las Vegas. Flight delays because of overbooking. I prearranged for wheel chair assistance. When I arrived at the airport at midnight there was no wheelchair, no Frontier employee. The gate was empty. Luckily some friends I made on the plane helped me. It is impossible to contact a real person at Frontier for any reason. A generic recording tells you to call back later! What good company does that? They overbook every flight which causes delays while they shuffle passengers around. Never fly Frontier Airlines.",0
"Pathetic front desk, impolite and worst staff experience at Mangalore airport. Feels like we are approaching a local bus station. Need to review, change your staff or else continue having these arrogant, rude staff. As a frequent flyer on other airlines I have never had this kind of experience.",0
TAP Portugal is the worst I've ever flown with. At first they cancelled my flight. The next flight was delayed and I missed my connection. No apology or explanation. Just bad.,0
"Canberra to Melbourne. Absolutely disgraceful, every time I have flown with QANTAS my flight has been delayed by at least an hour, it feels like its impossible to get good service from QANTAS anymore, utterly useless. Flight times printed on tickets can be completely disregarded and just hope that you get to fly out within a couple of hours later",0
"Melbourne to Seoul via Guangzhou. Pretty satisfied with their service and the cabin staff were friendly and lovely. Compared to the last trip, their selections for movies weren't updated much so hopefully it'll get better in the future but other than that, kind service. Although my flight from Guangzhou to Seoul just got delayed 50 minutes. Overall, my experience with China Southern Airlines was great. Thanks for your lovely service.",1
"New Orleans to JFK via Washington. American Airlines is without doubt the worst airline. Delayed for almost 4 hours with only one update. Eventually get on the plane. Told we would have to wait 30mins to take off. 2 people decided they wanted to get off and so the whole flight got cancelled. Customer services were very rude with no apologies. Said they could fly me to Le Guardia but my luggage would go to JFK. Said I would get the train and I wanted my luggage back. I waited over 2 and a half hours for my luggage and missed my train. All the staff I spoke with were rude, weren't willing to help and in one case walked off whilst myself and several other passengers were talking to him. 8.5 hours in the airport. I only had 2 days in NY before flying back to the UK. I now only have one. It has ruined what has been a great month of traveling. I will not book with them in the future and I would strongly advise people using them. American Airlines you have given yourself a terrible reputation with your overseas travelers!",0
"Astana to Almaty. Staff was polite and the plane seemed new. I hope it will continue to work like this. After long stagnation in Kazakhstan aviation industry, this was like fresh air, even not considering the price of the flight. Only inconvenience was lack of credit card payment support, only cash support.",1
Denver to Midland scheduled departure time was supposed to be 2.15pm. The flight was delayed 3 times and all while the plane was sitting at the boarding gate. The airline employee spike very broken English. Said that anyone traveling with children needed to be checked due to weight restrictions. She then said that 6 people needed to give up their seats for luggage of other travelers or she would not let the last people that checked in on the flight. No one volunteered so she picked 6 people 2 of which were military personnel. Once on the plane people were told to move seats to even out weight since. We will never fly with this airline again.,0
"This was the first time I used this airline and it was one of the best airlines I have flown with, staff very good and helpful, clean aircraft, and was on time there and back. A very enjoyable flight and will be using them again.",1
"Bangkok to Sydney with Emirates. The service was robotic at best. The seat was so narrow so much that the person next to me was basically sitting in my lap the entire trip, and legroom was barely enough. The food was very cluttered in choice and tasted bland. For a company that prides themselves on quality of food and service they should share that experience with the entire plane, not just business class.  The free WIFI was a bonus but at 10MB was hardly enough in the age of smartphones.",0
"Amsterdam to Bangkok. KLM is getting better and better. Friendly staff, good food, also in between you can get enough drinks and bites. And nice new interior. Seat pitch not superb.",1
"At a time when airlines are getting lots of bad press, what a nice surprise it was flying with Air Transat. Both our flights to Punta Cana and home were flawless. We will definitely use Transat again.",1
"Aeromexico have come a long way since I flew them about 10 years ago. I flew from Cancun to New York JFK. Comfortable seats and legroom, and each seat with TV screen and current movies, headphones, at no charge. A sandwich was served on a tray. Very pleasant and professional flight crew.",1
Flew back from Barbados to Newcastle after a Thomson Cruise. This was probably the best Thomson flight we have had there were complimentary drinks entertainment newspapers etc and I have to say the food provided was good by airline standards. The plane was a 767 and probably only a couple of years old. I would have given 10 for satisfaction if it had not been for a 2 hour delay.,1
This is the worst airline to fly on. No leg room for standard seating. You have to pay for everything separately and once your finish the cost is much higher. If I could change my ticket to another airline I would. But I will be leaving Florida on Monday 18th August. The 9 dollar club is a joke. Customer service is the awful. This is one customer Spirit has lost. Be aware. You're paying for bad service.,0
"I flew with Sky Express in early June 2022 which was proved to be a terrible mistake.  Their customer service department is a mess. They lost my luggage and spend my entire holidays without it. There is no phone number to contact and all the communication was done by email. They are slow in responding and never reply to all the questions you ask. They just say what they want to say and that's it. After spending most of my holidays, they notified me that they could compensate 30.00 EUR per day.  They did not even apologise for the inconvenience! Two months after, I still haven't received any compensation. Save yourselves and seek alternative airlines. T",0
Worst airline ever. I am 90 years old and was on a wheelchair under Spirit care. They change the flight departure time back and forth. Also they change boarding gates. They took off and left me in Puerto Rico. My son had to come back and pick me up. Next day there were all kinds of fights at their desk where they have to call the police.,0
"Antalya to London via Cologne, the worst airline experience I have had. Firstly we checked in at Antalya Airport and they could only print off our boarding pass for one leg of the journey and we were told we would need to exit the airport and check in again in Cologne. This flight was delayed, we missed our connection and then queued for over 2 hours to speak with the ticketing desk. We were put on the next flight which was also delayed, meaning we didn't get back until 7 hours after our scheduled landing. I have tried to claim compensation with no response other than ""this is the risk you take flying with a low cost airline"". This was actually stated by one of their customer service representatives. I will never fly Eurowings again.",0
"Tel Aviv to Barcelona. This is the new flagship of El Al, replacing aircraft like the 767 and 747. the configuration is 3x3x3 and the seats are nice and comfortable. Entertainment systems is very good with a wide screen and the basic WIFI is free. service was very good.",1
The day we were to depart was a bad weather day for the North Eastern part of the country and the aircraft we were to take from Reagan International was delayed due to weather. When we arrived at the airport shortly before the flight I received a call regarding this delay. When we finally go to the ticket counter the agent informed us that we would more than likely miss our connecting flight and they wanted us to depart from Dulles. After speaking to the customer service agent we were informed of the situation and they would pay for a taxi to get to Dulles send our bags and upgrade us on the United flight to first class. We got to Dulles with time to spare boarded our flight and got to California early enough to get a good nights rest before catching our connection. End result we arrived to our destination refreshed on time and ready. Our luggage arrived with us as well.,1
"When I tell you the reviews was so discouraging and negative but go against all odds. The flight from Freeport to Fort Lauderdale was peaceful and safe. It was 3 members in my party. We were scheduled to return to the US on Sunday but do to hurricane Dorian on the way we had to leave the resort in a hurry. All the airlines we're booked! The only thing available was Bahamasair and I'm so grateful and took a huge leap of faith and booked. The aircraft took off on time with no delays, no turbulence and the pilot and team we're all will dress and pleasant. The Bahamians really took care of us. The flight was maybe 25 minutes with safe landing. When I read many of the reviews people were complaining about delays. Remember delays not denied. Thank you Bahamasair.",1
Flew British Airways from Sydney to Venice on 22nd April and return 20th May from Barcelona. From Sydney check in staff wonderful courteous and helpful. Cabin crew just as wonderful as Check in Staff. Food out of Sydney awful. Return journey was from Barcelona. Again check in Staff were wonderful and helpful. Cabin crew just as wonderful and food was fine.,1
"The crew were rude. The plane was delayed, we had a connecting flight. When airplane landed in Helsinki, and was just standing for a long time near the gate, we asked the crew to let those people, who had connecting flights with a little time to let get out of the plane before all other, but they declined it in rude manner. After everything also went SO slow, we missed our connecting flight because of the Finnair crew. During the flight they also was rude. Worst crew and airline service we have met. NOT recommend at all.",0
"Just ridiculous, my first trip from msp to cak my plane was delayed 15 mins, okay whatever it's fine, after 15 mins it was further delayed for 1 hour, okay as long as I make my connecting flight its fine, after an hour it was delayed for 3 hours 45 mins due to mechanical issue. Okay wtf, now I have to call and reschedule a whole new flight while already being late for my business trip. Now on my flight back home everything is going fine I got on the plane and into my seat. ""I'm sorry passenger we will be delaying the flight for 30 mins due to awaiting for passengers that have their flight delayed"" ""I'm sorry passengers we will be further delaying the flight for an additional 30 minutes due to waiting for those passengers"" Absolutely ridiculous! Worst experience so far with this airline.",0
"Flew Air Tahiti Nui from Auckland to Los Angeles. Firstly the customer service is terrible and they can't change seats on a near empty flight because they are ""not allowed to"". Once on the plane I realised how uncomfortable the seats were, hard and no leg room. The service is terrible as they barely speak english and don't seem to care about customers. They served drinks once on the flight and would not get a coke for me so they just gave the terrible orange juice that was served with breakfast. The food was horrible. Entertainment barely works and is outdated. The headphones they give you are terrible and you can't hear anything with them. No space for items so I say you put your items in the overhead because you can barely fit an iPhone into the seat back pocket. I do not recommend this airline because of it's poor service and terrible seats.",0
Flights from LJU to ZRH and back all on time. In Economy class was served just coffee tea an water but it's fine for one and a half hour flight. Very friendly and helpful cabin crew members. Very clean and comfortable cabin on CRJ900 aircraft.,1
"It was very unpleasant journey since flight supposed to start at 10.25 which delayed to start 2.09 pm, landed at 5.32 pm instead of 2pm. However airlines did not let out passengers after 6.48pm, still in the flight. It was very stressful journey and our vacation totally collapsed. I would not recommend anyone to Alaska airlines for Hawaii vacation.",0
"Las Vegas to Guadalajara. I have flown with Volaris for years for the direct flight but never again. Every year they get worse and worse. They come up with hidden charges and what applied on your way to your destination doesn't apply on the way back. Horrible customer service, the absolute worst across the board. All the employees look depressed and angry. The planes are all old and the safety inserts aren't even in every seat. If you actually have one it's always tattered and dirty. Horrible!",0
Budapest to Luton. Appalling size of carry on allowed. Staff at boarding walk around singling people out to be told to fit bags in the tiny space in front of everyone else. People forced to kneel down in front of monosyllabic empty staff members with no compassion. Utterly degrading. My bag fitted within the checked size but needed readjusting. Unfriendly experience from start to finish. I will never travel with wizz again.,0
"My Spirit Airlines flight from St Thomas to Fort Lauderdale was delayed 3 times up to 2 hours, nearly missing my next flight from Fort Lauderdale to Detroit. When we finally landed they held us in the plane for an extra 30 minutes as apparently there was no open gate. Not only was I going to miss my connecting flight but the gate we were waiting on was my flight so I ended up watching my next flight take off. I'm now spending the night at the airport as that was the last flight to Detroit and construction is preventing me from sleeping. I'm surprised there's no complementary water or snacks for passengers. Carry on along with printing boarding passes costs a pretty penny. Never flying Spirit again.",0
London to Vienna. Flight delayed so I would have missed my connection. Impossible to change or cancel flight. I spent over one hour waiting on telephone before I hung up in disgust. No service desk at Heathrow and no one could help. This is shocking service.,0
"In our 40 years of flying we have never experienced more rude and unprofessional flight attendants. Not only did we notice but others around us did as well, you could tell they hated their jobs and you as the customers were going to suffer the consequences. They spoke in such rudeness! We will never fly with United again.",0
"San Juan, Puerto Rico to Orlando. Trash airline, they charge you for everything. Flight delayed 2 hours without explanation. Very uncomfortable seats. First and last time I fly with them.",0
This airline is terrible. We are currently stranded in an airport 3 hours away from home after the airline cancelled two flights due to crew shortage. The Cape Air agent was reluctant to arrange ground transportation despite the contractual obligation to get us to our destination. I will never use this airline again.,0
"Gatwick to Malaga. Very bad experience on 2nd October, my flight was delayed with more than 2 hours. Instead of taking off at 5 pm was delayed to 7.30. There was already another flight to Malaga same time with easyjet. Was no information on the screens as to what gate, so I  went to information desk, they didn't know exactly. Running around, stressed and got to Malaga after 11 pm. Had to pay extra for a taxi in order to get home. Not happy",0
"Absolutely terrible service. Not only did our original flight get rescheduled to a much later time frame, and leave late, we missed our connection to our final destination. The flight attendants lied to us and said we would be accommodated in a nearby hotel and to ask the ""Just Ask"" service center at JFK, the customer service rep there said there were no available hotel rooms and the flight attendants just lie to customers so they dont get upset on the plane. The customer service rep was extremely rude and unaccommodating, could not find a new flight, rental car, or hotel for us so left us stranded in JFK. Would never fly again.",0
"Tampa to Gatwick. I paid to have my seats bumped up to business class and when I got to the airport they wouldn't let me on the flight because someone on their side messed up when they booked my seats, so instead of honoring my seats they just sat there for an hour telling me they can't do anything and I can't get on the plane. They waited till the very last second before the check in period closed to reissue my tickets and won't reimburse me for the seats that I paid for, but never received.",0
"We were set to fly out at 12.30 but when we arrived at the airport they said the flight was delayed 3hrs, originally we were supposed to get to Baltimore at 10.30 pm, but when they issued our tickets they put our connecting flight leaving at 8.00 am the next day. When we arrived in Fort Lauderdale at 9.00pm we went to the ticketing counter and waited 2 hours in line just to find out they couldn't get us on a earlier flight. They don't do anything for their customers, no food vouchers, no hotel, no cup of coffee , nothing . Everyone one we talked to just had that attitude that they just don't give a damn, I will never fly Spirit Airlines again or recommend it.",0
Guwahati to Pakyong. Spicejet is the worst airline company. They cancel flights when they could not sell there full tickets and blame the cancellation to bad weather condition. They do not have the decency to inform the passengers beforehand so that they can arrange for an alternative. You will know about the cancellation at airport. Thereafter you will have to run to Spicejet office and request them to refund your money.,0
"Tbilisi to Gatwick. We are currently delayed at Tbilisi for 6 hours. We have tried to get the basics, like water and somewhere for the young children to rest. But we are getting fobbed off. The two airline reps have now disappeared. Its seams they are happy to deny even children the basic rights of water.",0
"Dallas to Las Vegas. Horrible! I'll never fly with Spirit Airlines again. Sent me 3 different delay emails got to the airport and the flight left on time. The planes are poor, not comfortable at all.",0
Smiling and professional service punctuality comfortable seats with seat allocation  without paying extra like all low costs! I had left my ipod on the plane was recovered by staff and mailed back to me in less than a week. Thanks a lot Aer lingus.,1
"Calgary to Vancouver. Luggage issues. This company charges for luggage but they dont care about it, we checked in one bag for a short trip the bag never arrived to the destination. Tried their luggage counter, useless, they blame the checking counter at the departure city, and had us wait for the next fly to arrive, maybe the bag was coming on a different fly, go figure, it was not. They said could not do anything we had to email to lost luggage. 5 days later, many emails sent, zero replies. Phone calls absolutely useless, their contact number is for a travel agency, nothing to do with Flair, so they said. They lost the luggage and don't take responsibility at all. Bad idea to fly with Flair air, if you think you would save money. It could cost you more as you would never completely replace your belongings. The worse is that they don't care.",0
I will never fly Spirit again. 15 hours waiting in the airport because they were short staffed absolutely unacceptable. Worst fight ever. Never again!,0
Very disappointed in the customer service and lack of communication. Southwest verified and ensured that a pet could fly under their policy with the owner during his move to another state. Seems it was a very different story when they showed up in person. Owner was faced with abandoning the pup or not seeing his family.,0
"Very bad service, not very Clear where to go for Help. Help desk even in security zone to pass by. Overbooking is on regular basis unfortunately. In cabin the service is ok. But airline itself is disaster. No Hotel inside airport so you have to go outside if you miss your flight because of overbooking by Airline and pay meals, taxi yourself.",0
"Due to weather conditions, my flight from Birmingham to Kolkata via Dubai got cancelled after 3 hours from check in at the airport. While other airlines were distributing food coupons after the delayed flights Emirates said they'll transfer us to hotel in their coach. We stood at the conveyor belt and collected my luggage which were distributed between two belts. We came out to find out that there is no coach, no hotel. Emirates made the promise while they were trying to arrange for hotels, they either don't know their verbs or plain lied. Their latest version was 'we are suggesting you go home and we will contact you when you are rescheduled'. A flight can get cancelled due to weather conditions but can a reputed brand act such foolishly and keep lie conveniently and put their valued customer in a vulnerable situation. While UK came to standstill I was dragging 50kg luggage in snow all by myself at 10pm in the night.",0
"Frontier Airlines has the worst customer service. I showed up around 55 min before the flight but the ladies at the counter told me that the gate was closed, gave me a piece of paper to call Frontier and just walked away.",0
12th July flight BI097 arriving into Heathrow 13th July. Left London on 18th July arriving into Melbourne early morning were we had a connecting flight to Coolangatta. We had a lovely surprise holiday from Australia to London flying Royal Brunei and all I can say it was a memory we will never forget. From start to finish we were treated like royalty. Nothing was never to much the service food beds flight and people were lovely. We have always flown economy and never experienced 1st class. We will never fly economy again spend the extra and get what your deserve luxury.,1
"Zurich to Quito via Madrid. Very disappointed with Iberia. I arrived 07.11.2017 at Quito, while my suitcase did not make it. Iberia promised to deliver my suitcase by 09.11.2017. When I called they told me that the suitcase was just arriving and they could not deliver it until 10.11.2017. Today in the morning I got a call from Iberia, that my suitcase will be delivered today. However, my suitcase still did not get delivered and when I call Iberia nobody would pick up the phone. I am here in Ecuador on vacation and have already lost several days waiting for my suitcase with my clothes and other important stuff in it, and Iberia does not even answer my calls. This is very bad service. I would not recommend to fly with Iberia.",0
"Cancun to Toronto. My Wife and I had never flown with Interjet before and after flying with them I wanted to give them a great review. Staff were great, the flight was amazing they served us a nice sandwich and refreshments and if you wanted an alcohol drink there was no charge for that. Thank you Interjet for the great service and wonderful flight.",1
First we were over 1.5 hours late for take off from the Minneapolis then had to sit for over 20 minutes on the ground in Fort Lauderdale due to not having a gate because of our late departure. They charge you for every little thing. Not enough leg room if you bag is a half a pound over 40 pounds you get charged. All other airlines have a 50 pound limit. Leaving Fort Lauderdale again late taking off to MSP. Waited forever for our bags at the airport. I would never fly this airline again and would not recommend them to anyone. Low cost what a joke especially after you add all the extra charges for everything.,0
"Guangzhou to Auckland. Very nice welcome at check in, boarding pass issued and a brief wait and then the flight boarded early. Got to Auckland slightly ahead of schedule. Staff give extremely good service during the flight. Food is about average, seats are comfortable. IFE has great selections in different language. No frills, no fuss, great service. Highly recommended airline for international travel.",1
"I have travelled a lot and would have to say Malindo Air is the worst airline I have ever been on. We were the only two in Business class and we had to ask for service and there was two hostesses. Food was a terrible. With the head sets for movies only one side worked and movies, well they would have had to be 10 years old on some of them. Seats were uncomfortable. Total waste of money!",0
"An old aircraft but well maintained, free snacks and water, smooth landing.  Impressed with their service and price.",1
Melbourne to Manchester via Singapore with Singapore Airlines. Whilst travelling from Singapore to Manchester via Munich I fell ill. All of the staff were extremely helpful and took good care of me. They were professional and very caring to my well being. I would like to thank them for their dedication. I would use Singapore Airlines whenever I go back to Australia.,1
"Flight was cancelled due to mechanical issues, emails were too slow for reroute options, ended up having to stay overnight in a hotel. Alternate flight was cancelled by parent company Westjet. The old saying does apply here, ""you get what you pay for""",0
QF28 from Santiago to Sydney on 12th May was a dream trip. Staff very attentive personalized service and great seat comfort. Cabin staff even suggested I try to get on an earlier flight from Sydney to Melbourne after clearing customs and immigration which got me home 1 hour before schedule.,1
My husband and I had a wonderful flight on MH642 from Singapore to Kuching. The crew were very welcoming and warmth radiated from the very moment we stepped into the aircraft until we arrived in Kuching. Special mention to a steward for his excellent service and care towards all passengers on board.,1
"Great trip. I saw a number of negative reviews, but realized most of them were from people who just didn't follow the rules. Bag sizes are very clear, just follow the rules! Staff were very friendly, flights were on time, airplane was clean. I wonder how many of the negative reviews are from inexperienced flyers?",1
Do not use this airline if you need to be anywhere at a certain time or date. They will cancel or move your reservation as they please with no compensation. Customer service is terrible.,0
Mumbai to Perth with a stopover at KUL. By far the worst experience I've had. The flight in Mumbai was delayed by over 2 hours due to late arrival of incoming flight. Finally staff started boarding and let passengers into the gates. However everyone was stopped from boarding and were kept waiting at the aerobridge for more than 1.5 hours! There was little explanation with some staff talking amongst themselves about a technical problem. No one was allowed back into the terminal to use the toilets. Had to run at KL with hardly 10 mins to catch the connecting flight. Their seats are by far the most uncomfortable business class seats I've seen. The angular seats leave you with a terrible back ache. Never again.,0
San Jose to Newark. Worst customer service I have come across in a long time. The absolute lack of communication after delaying a flight 7 hours. No offer of hotel or accommodation. Only to show up next day to another delayed flight. Customer care was off for the holiday.,0
"Wamena to Jayapura with Wings Air. Being the first flight of the day, the aircraft was on standby at the airport and departed pretty much on time. It was a smooth flight with no issues whatsoever.",1
"My grandfather flew home from Orlando to Columbus and Delta Air Lines had promised he would be transferred from flight to flight along with his carry on. I told them repeatedly that he had dementia and they said that this was not a problem. They would make sure everything made it flight to flight. He arrived to Ohio and was greeted by aunt with no carry on! When I addressed them about the situation all I got was I'm sorry and that there was no carry on to be found! I had no issues with the flight to Florida, it was only the return flight! And no one will speak to you! It's all automated.",0
"Osaka to Hanoi with VietJet Air. Avoid at all cost! We booked the ticket 5 months in advance and got the wrong itinerary for date of reservation. Then a new one came a month later with again one day too early. As time passes we thought that we booked for 2 days, not 3. So we come to the airport and they tell us that our flight is the next day. Apparently, they sent us a good itinerary 4 days ago when we were already in the middle of the trip. The staff were rude to us and didn't even want to help with arrangements of transportation or hotel. Just asked us to pay money for changing the ticket. We are now in a hotel next to the airport. I will never fly this airline again. Also, we had delayed the flight because the plane was broken when we were coming here. Adding 3 hours of delay!",0
"Extra late takeoff. Rude staff. Seats were reserved in January. We got emails this morning confirming our seats with checkin. When we arrived and got our boarding passes, my wife and I had completely different seats in 2 different rows no longer next to each other. When trying to get it corrected, which took about 25 minutes and 3 people before anyone would even help, we were told that our seats were now taken by other people, and they can't do anything to help. There was only one seat remaining in row 30 when we reserved row 12. Cannot reccomend.",0
"Booked flight several weeks in advance. However, the flight crew didn't get the memo. My flight was scheduled to leave at 7.46. I receive an email not from Spirit but from the 3rd party site I went through for the tickets to let me know the flight is delayed and my new departure time would be 12.32am! With a delay this long I believed that something was extremely wrong with the plane but that wasn't the case. The airline couldn't ""find"" a crew to fly the plane. The worst communication and organization skills I've witnessed from an airline. I'll never be flying Spirit again. ",0
Flew from Newcastle to Cardiff on the 6th November 2014. Arrived at the airport in good time to be told that the 0.640 flight to Cardiff was being combined with the 07.40 flight to Birmingham. This was due to that only 7 people were due to fly on the Cardiff flight and it wasn't economically viable to run the flight. Got bounced to the 07.40 flight to Birmingham which eventually arrived in Cardiff just under 2 hours late. Poor show planes are shabby seats are hard and the cost is astronomical. If your final destination is not near Cardiff consider alternative options. My journeys end was in Bath and it took just as long what with getting the bus from the airport to the railway station and then the train journey than by either train all the way or by driving. Will not be using Eastern again.,0
"I had a short notice business trip Melbourne to Sydney booked just the day before, so ended up in a middle seat on the 7 am. In the lounge I asked if an aisle seat had opened up. The friendly agent responded it's a very busy flight, but my fare qualified for an upgrade with one of my platinum vouchers. I would normally not use them on a short flight, but I really dislike middle seats, and she had such a nice smile at 6.10 am, so I took it. Perfect trip, very attentive FAs, surprisingly good coffee. After 10 years in US, Virgin Australia is just such a nice difference.",1
"Ahmedabad to Delhi . I am travel agent from Gandhinagar, Gujarat. I have recently travelled with my family first time with your company. It was worst of worst experience to fly with SpiceJet. On the airport Sign board only Spicejet flights were late, and due to the delayed flight we missed our Sightseeing and reached hotel very late! I dont understand why only Spicejet flight has many problems.  I will never recommend Spicejet to all clients.",0
Orlando to Philadelphia. Spirit Airlines sent an email the night before saying I should arrive 3 hours early. Got to the counter to find my flight had been delayed by 5 hours. Spirit had sent the notification email two hours before departure. My flight has either been delayed or moved up without warning 3 out of the 4 times I've flown them. The planes are uncomfortable and my time is worth more than the small amount of money saved by using this airline. Never flying them again.,0
"Casablanca to Chicago via Montreal. My family and I was went on vacation to Morocco from Chicago. For some reason they weren't able to book my flight completely with theirs and I had all routes with the 6 of them except for going home from Montreal back to Chicago I had a layover of about 8 hours. After being in Morocco for 9 days on the road and falling sick, I was wanting to get home with my family. We  requested them to allow that to happen. I could not afford the 150 dollars change fee and they saw my family board a plane with empty seats available but refuse to put me on it even though the baggage could have been transferred over. Then there was another flight 4 hours later that they didn't want to put me on either and said you chose to buy this ticket.",0
"Most horrible easyJet ticketing staff at Schiphol Airport. I missed my flight through my own fault, and was extremely upset because I had to get back to London by 5pm that day to catch my flight back to Australia. My airline to Australia had no other seats available until two weeks later so I had to get back that day. The woman I spoke to just gave me a really cold look and basically made it clear she couldn't care less about me the customer. Offered me no help, and  all I got was indifference which was even more upsetting. Luckily for me a kind stranger saw me in tears and calmed me down enough for me to get it together and eventually get on a BA flight to London City Airport which got me to London in time. I will never bother with easyJet again and will not recommend it. When things go wrong they don't give a stuff about their customers.",0
LH434 Munich to Chicago 26th January. Had multiple trips to the US with Lufthansa over the past couple of months and service timing and equipment was always perfect. Could recommend it fully but Economy seats should have a little more space.,1
Flew from New Orleans to Cancun. A travel warning was issued to our place of destination after booking the flight. Other members of our group are flying with Delta and I regret not doing so. Everyone was able to change their ticket as Delta was understanding of the circumstances. I was not given that option and could not even escalate the call to speak to someone for assistance. The customer service I received was useless and the lack of concern for safety is completely unacceptable. Never using American Airlines again.,0
Kuala Lumpur to Mumbai. The satay is one of best thing in this flight. Crew were very polite. Very good taste of food. Malaysia Airlines Golden Lounge with the new refurbished set up is one of the best lounge in the region.,1
"This airline flies under the banner of British Airways. I thought the planes looked old and tired. The customer service onboard was OK, although slighly abrupt. The flight was delayed by 30 minutes. My flight with the same airline to Durban a few days earlier was also delayed for about an hour. When I asked for a customer service feedback form, they seemed shocked that I should want to offer feedback. Needless to say there was no way to leave feedback with the airline. I won't be flying with them again. Luckily there is now quite a bit of choice in South Africa.",0
"Flydubai gave a good experience, the flight staff were professional and attentive. They made us feel welcome and it wasn't a problem to ask for drinks. The food was good and seating was comfortable.",1
"I have been a loyal Allegiant Air customer for years, several flights logged. I booked a flight to Youngstown Ohio online. Upon arriving to the airport I began to board when I was confronted by an employee regarding additional charges. After several discussions with airline employees and not wanting to ruin the visit, I paid the additional fee in protest. The ""reasonable"" flight had now exceeded the cost of a ""nicer airline"". I will make the best of this more expensive flight with less quality but I'm a man of principal and will never utilize Allegiant Air again.",0
"London to Kuala Lumpur. Awful, rude customer service. The only way to make a complaint is by using their web form, which doesn't work. It doesn't recognise words like, United Kingdom and asks you to verify characters that aren't shown. There is only a phone number for reservations, but they won't help you if there's an issue. The airline damaged my suitcase and won't offer any compensation. I paid extra of an exit seat, but had to move seats because the exit seat was so crowded. They take a very long time to respond by email. I will never book with Malaysia Airlines again.",0
"I am not exaggerating if I say that is the worst user experience I have had in my entire life. They cancelled the flight due to corona, which is okay, but since then I am following up the refund of my ticket which still didn't happen. The service is awful, the staff impolite and the company a complete chaos which is obvious now under corona, the ""corona"" is a cheap excuse that airlines use to cover their disasters but now is the time when you see which are good airlines and which are horrible, in many ways.",0
"Hamilton to Halifax. I would not recommend taking Swoop Airlines. They left my wife, myself and our 4 year old little boy stranded in the Halifax airport on Wednesday. We ended up being 3 hours early for our flight and would not let us on because our app didn't work to check in. They just told us to call customer service, which puts you on hold for 6 hours. I fly often and this was one of the worst customer service experiences I have ever dealt with from any company.  I have tried contacting them many times and nobody will respond! Avoid this airline at all cost.",0
"Miami to Prague via Lisbon. Trip started badly, as my United frequent flyer number was not accepted by their system, only the TAP number could be entered. Emails are ignored, although I have tried! The plane was new, but even in business class very uncomfortable. Seats give little room to sleep, feels really cramped. The staff were very sullen and uninterested in the passengers, gave a poor attitude to any questions. Food was really bad, cannot believe that they cannot provide a better quality.",0
"San Antonio to Dallas. I have been sitting on a plane for 8 hours and it should have been an hour and a half flight. We sat at our gate for about four hours before we even took off for our flight and now that we have arrived at our destination from San Antonio to Dallas, we have been sitting here for 3 hours. I was originally scheduled to leave at 7.50pm front SAT, and around 5.30 I received a call informing me my flight had been cancelled and that I was going to be on a new flight departing at 6.27. I was 30 minutes from the airport so I rushed, incredibly fast, to find my flight had been cancelled not only once more, but three more times. Now, finally after boarding and waiting four hours to take off due to adding 360 miles to the trip, having to fuel up with 2,000 more pounds of fuel and maintenance problems, here we sit. With no word for almost exactly 3 hours. I had to call DFW to find out why exactly there were no gates available. No food, no water until orange juice was offered at about 2 and a half hours in. I am appalled at this experience. And they ran out of food because the flight before us was supposed to be a 50 minute flight but turned out to be 4 hours.",0
"Bahrain to Copenhagen via Istanbul. Cabin crew  rude, seats are extremely uncomfortable they do not recline, space is very tight, passengers were very noisy. They don't provide meals except for extra fees payable when booking, the snacks for sale during flight were very expensive, no screen or any kind of entertainment. The allowed luggage weight less than other airlines.",0
"Wife and I flew here back in May and just the other day. Lost luggage 2 pieces x5 days. Thus time 2x pieces luggage now counting 3rd day. Cannot say the customer service is awful because when you are rarely able to reach anyone you get the run around no responsibility, no professionalism, no accountability. I could go on about the flights themselves yet would take far too long here. Been traveling globally for 40 years and we have never seen and had to experience worst service in our lives. Yet, they have the audacity to charge outrageous prices and their idea of excellence is simply getting you there in one piece alive. Pitiful, pathetic, incredulous to describe briefly! STAY AWAY, you will be denied access to water on the plane and the food is inedible to say the least. Didn't even have a boarding pass for our connection out of Paris.",0
Barcelona to Oakland. I originally booked with this airline because of the good prices for the flights. But I now regret this decision after being delayed on our outward and return flights. After reviewing this airline on the internet I have come to realize that this seems to be a regular occurrence with this airline. In the future I will definitely avoid this airline.,0
"I waited in the check in line for 3 hours because it was under staffed, after my flights was rescheduled and had to ring Jetstar a number of times to sort it out. Now my flight has been pushed back a day later when I have wedding to attend.",0
New York to Abu Dhabi is one of the worst flights I have traveled. Seats are cramped and extremely uncomfortable not much leg room. Cabin was too cold and cabin crew was not helpful. Food was not great. I had a horrible experience and it took 2 days to recover from all the tiredness. Don't try this airline even though they offer a the cheapest price.,0
I just recently flew to the east coast departing from the west coast. This was the first time I tried flying with Southwest and have absolutely no regrets. I experienced no delays. My flights were on time and 30 minutes early at one of my layovers. I found the staff very nice and it made my flight fun. I will stay with southwest from now on when I fly. Thanks Southwest for such an enjoyable trip across country!,1
"Trenton to Chicago, we could not land so we returned back to Trenton due to mechanical problem . We were told that we were going to get help once we arrive back to trenton. When we got to Trenton there was not 1 person there to give us answers, all their gates were closed. Instead of fixing the issue and sending us back to our destination, most people had to spend the night at the airport. The ticket might be cheap but it so not worth it. Now i have to drive all the way to JFK to find a new ticket in the morning. Don't Fly Frontier, you will regret it for the rest of your life.",0
"I really appreciated the crew from China Southern Airlines, they are so efficient. I flew from Detroit to Guangzhou, and the Delta flight was delayed for 4.5 hours. When we arrived at Beijing, obviously I have missed my connecting flight by China Southern, and the next flight to Guangzhou was in 60 minutes. Gladly, people from China Southern helped me through everything and I boarded in time. I want to say the service on my flight to Guangzhou, the crew on that plane were awesome. They helped me a lot during the 2 and half hours fly. ",1
"I flew with Ryanair 6 years ago to Italy and vowed I would never use them again.  I broke that vow as they were the only airline who flew into Jerez. They have improved their service both on the ground and in the air. The young crew showed exceptional customer service throughout, smiling and joking with passengers. Hopefully other Ryanair crews are up to that excellent standard. We will certainly use you again after this service, and I just hope it wasn't a one off.",1
"Flew Singapore Airlines from Perth to Singapore. Terrible customer service and substandard conditions. Seat was ""wet"" departing Perth. Notified flight attendant and sat on blanket. Five hours later on descent, senior flight attendant came and said, ""sorry about that"". Attitude was indifferent and no effort was made to recover the situation. They're supposed to be known for their excellent customer service, it went missing!",0
"I bought a ticket from Melbourne to Tallin with Qatar airways and airBaltic, which was cancelled twice. After being able to rebook the flight for the third time I was on my way. At Stockholm my connecting airBaltic flight was cancelled. The staff at the airport was no help and told me to contact the airline. After being on the wait list on the phone for over an hour Qatar airways representative told me that there was nothing they were able to do. I was stranded in Stockholm with no possible flight to continue my trip, they would not give me a refund or  accommodation. After spending hours in the airport I was able to continue my journey with a ticket I had to purchase myself with no help from Qatar.",0
Abu Dhabi to Johannesburg. Great cabin crew with good service. Flight departed on time and the lie flat seat on business is good. Great food selection and in flight entertainment selection.,1
Grand Rapids to St Pete Clearwater. Was one of the worst customer service I have ever received! They were extremely rude and it was outrageous at the tone I received from the customer service representative very inconsistent to what I had to say. The airline is not flexible at all and I will never be flying with them again!,0
"Hamilton to Abbotsford. I was recommended Swoop airlines by a friend and had the most horrible experience with their staff at the airport, the customer care helpline is the worse, I missed my flight for something that was not my fault, the customer care is non existent, they are understaffed and rude. I would be surprised if this airlines stays in business for the next 2 years. I would gladly pay my money to airlines that cares for their passengers and owns up to their mistakes.",0
"Edinburgh to Marrakesh via Barcelona. Plane late leaving Edinburgh. Arrived in Marrakesh to find my luggage did not accompany me. Filled out PIR Form at Marrakesh Airport. Phoned every day to be told 'tomorrow' . Ended up going to the Airport on the Thursday and luggage was to arrive there at 23.00 on the Friday. Collected luggage on the Saturday and this was last day of holiday. Veuling want receipts for everything I had to buy. Unfortunately Marrakesh Markets do not provide receipts so I am out of pocket for sandals, toiletries and emergency clothing required for six days and two taxin trips to the airport! Surely there should be a daily allowance for passengers whose luggage you have lost and it should be an automatic payment and not the rigmarole that you put your passengers through to claim compensation.",0
Fort Lauderdale to Atlanta via Las Vegas. Most uncomfortable plane in existence. Plane appeared to be newer but the seats were so uncomfortable that my back took 4 days to correct itself. Could hardly move after a nice relaxing vacation. Put a huge damper on my week long cruise vacation. Would rather drive across the US then use this plane ever again.,0
"24 hours before my flight from Sydney to Hong Kong departed, Qantas informed me that is cancelled. The next departure was 24 hours after it was cancelled, so I'm looking for another flight, but it was full. I have no idea what to do since I have an important things to do in Hong Kong, I better give up later on and fly Cathay Pacific instead. Worst experience ever, customer service is poor and the average service is getting worse. ",0
"I use this airline frequently because it is the only airline serving Orkney. If you are coming to Orkney and are able to use the ferries then do so, this airline is a disgrace, frequently delayed and cancelled and a total absence of customer service. However I would say that the cabin staff are fantastic, it is just a shame they are stuck working for this airline.",0
"This is the second time I choose China Southern Airlines. It is weird that the hand carry policy of China Southern Airlines at Heathrow airport are different. When you check in, the staff tell you there were only 7kg you can carry on the flight, actually the policy was shown that 5kg is allowed. I don't know where the 7kg comes from, that was a puzzle. Finally, it took 3 hours to fix it out, so I don't have time to shopping in duty free. Maybe the staff should be trained more.",0
Penang to Singapore. I don't like feeling hustled! My girlfriend and I ordered tickets online without having a way to weigh our luggage. We were allowed 40kg for baggage claim but actually had 52kg in total. Cost for the difference came out to double our flight costs combined. Our only solution was to stuff as much clothing we could into our carry ons which only made a 5kg difference. The attendant was not helpful with solutions or cost effective options. What's weird is that we're putting the same amount of weight onto the plane!,0
Return flight to Dublin. Outbound Galleries North fine and good breakfast. Flight was fine. Return flight was delayed by 40 mins gate staff kept us informed. Lounge at Dublin was generic lounge but was ok. Staff on both flights fine. Return aircraft quite new and well presented.,1
"Following the demise of BA Comair we were booked onto SAA for the final leg of a return from the UK on BA. What a pleasure to find a proper business class seat with good legroom, compared with the European standard economy class seat with the middle seat blocked. Check in and boarding were efficient and on board service was good. There were no hassles with the transfer at ORT and the A320 on the second leg had the best regional business cabin I have experienced. Very spacious 2x2 configuration. Again service was good, and our overall impression was the the staff were very pleased to be back and keen to provide top service.",1
Manila to Bangkok. Terminal needs to be improved. Flight was on time. Ground service was ok. Flight crew was the best. Food was decent but needs to be improved. Aircraft was new.,1
I like this airline would choose it in future and would recommend to others. Only issue is the leg from Mumbai to Goa which is often delayed and seems unorganised but fly business class and like that I can accrue airmiles via jet privilege club membership.,1
London to Dallas Ft Worth. I have been luck to fly with the latest Business Class product of American Airlines on Boeing 777.  Individual access on each seat. Awesome personal inflight entertainment. On board staff friendly and professional. WiFi was great. Catering was excellent.  I'd fly again with AA.,1
"Amsterdam to Lviv via Warsaw. First they have no reason to depart 2 hours late from Amsterdam. Transfer is missed. Then for 2nd transfer ground personnel send me to wrong gate. Then 3rd transfer is night flight. Then maybe it works. Really disappointing, weather was good. Effective airtime is 1.6 hours. This way travel is 17 hour.  They told me if you miss a flight the rest of the tickets are invalid! Staff is friendly but their timetable is unreliable. Bad for business.",0
I flew with American Airlines on October 20th this year from Dublin to JFK with my husband and two sons 12 and 9. The staff onboard that day were excellent we had the back seats just beside the staff and each one of them could not have made our flight more comfortable. Being our first flight to America and travelling with our youngest son who has autism it was quite a worry but the staff made him and us very comfortable. We are travelling back to the states in 2015 and I will make sure it is with American Airlines.,1
Our family flew economy with El Al to Tel Aviv from Bangkok on September 19th and return trip on October 10th 2015. On both occasions ground and air crew were very friendly and polite. The food onboard was above average. IFE was good going from Bangkok to Tel Aviv but not so great on the return trip but as we were flying all night and trying to sleep it did not matter. The plane was old but clean and the toilets were kept clean during both flights. All of the staff were great and very accommodating. My one and only criticism is that the plane was warm which made flying just a tad uncomfortable. I read in the onflight magazine that all of their 747's are being replaced in 2017. Will fly with them again.,1
"You can not talk to anyone, all agents tell you they can not do anything and will advise you to leave feedback which no one answer, I am a business class customer and sent more than 8 feedbacks and 7 phone calls and no answer, my flight less than 12 hrs and I am stranded.",0
Regularly fly with Ryanair from Dublin to France and it works wonderfully. Listen to a lot of people complaining about the airline and really cannot understand why. Staff are usually pleasant although there is always the exception to the rule. It's always on time boarding and exiting is always efficient. Without this airline we and many others could not fly as often.,1
I was not well and asked for water 4 times even when the staff was serving i asked for water. They were only concentrating on people who had ordered for food! After paying so much money to these airline companies with hefty amount of service taxes this is the kind of service we get? in a 2 hrs flight i kept asking for water by pressing the service button twice but I was not entertained.,0
"China Southern Airlines are the only airline that still use A380 type in this line from Los Angeles to Guangzhou in China, even in an epidemic, we always could get a good service and flying experience. When my wife and I arrived in Guangzhou Baiyun airport, the ground service team also very kind and friendly.",1
"On our way back home from the Dominican Republic our plane to New York was delayed about 6 hours. When we first heard this we were so upset because they only have one plane that comes into that small airport but they quickly worked out a plan to get us home. They were going to put us in a hotel overnight in New York but I am a critical care nurse and could not miss any more days of work. Right when they heard this they switched our connecting flight and even changed our destination from San Diego to LAX. They comped our taxi ride, gave us food vouchers and even a coupon for our next flight with them. They made a very stressful situation run so smoothly. They lady at the desk in LAX knew how to be patient with people. She was so helpful and sweet. We will for sure be flying with Jetblue on future flights! ",1
"Boston to Minneapolis. Spirit Airlines nickle and dime you to death. Their baggage size limits for personal items have changed, forcing you to pay for a bag. Nothing is easy on their website. I spent 2 hours trying to check in and pay for bags only to have the boarding passes print saying 0 bags. Now I have to call their customer service. This is not worth it.",0
Chennai to FRA. It was a old 747 flight the IFE screen was very small and useless no touch screen. There was no great selection of movies unless you know German. I wish I carried iPad. The FA's were rude not interested in customer service. For the 10 hour flight from Chennai to Frankfurt first 8 hours they serve nothing other then two rounds of juice. Just before landing a small light breakfast. Seats were cramped. I was disappointed with LH and will not fly again.,0
"Flew St. John's to Las Vega via Toronto with Air Canada. I am so disappointed in the treatment I received during boarding at the beginning of my vacation today. It really put a sour start to my vacation. There was no room for my carry on luggage because people had bags and coats overhead. I was forced to check my carry on and I had to transfer my things such as medical items and other expensive things into a garbage bag that I had to ask for instead of being offered. During this, the flight attendants threatened to put us on later flight! Never even said sorry! I strongly believe they could have improved the situation by simply checking the overhead storage for small bags and coats and asking others to put it under their seats. They also could have been a little patient. I am currently dragging heavy garbage bags around the airport. They definitely could work on their manners and attitude.",0
"This was my first time flying Frontier. I started with a non stop flight to Punta Cana DR from Atlanta GA and return back from Punta Cana DR to Atlanta GA no stop. It changed from Atlanta to Chicago then to Punta Cana DR and return non stop back. Change again Punta Cana DR to Miami FL them to Atlanta GA. The change over to Punta Cana was not a problem, but flying back was. In Miami it was a 8 hour lay over that turned into 14 hours and 5 flight time changes. I tried to call Frontier and no telephone only email or chat. Which was useless. The Frontier counter workers at Miami were useless and no help. After traveling for 26 hours we finally made it back. I spent over 20 years in the military and have flown all over the world in the last 45 years of flying. The is the worst experience flying ever. I would not recommend this airlines to any one.",0
"Flying with Delta Airlines was the worst travel experience I've ever had. Both connecting flights to and from Rome were such a far distance away from the arrival gate. We had to take a shuttle, go through customs again and literally run to the gate. We almost missed the connecting flight. When we arrived in Rome, our bags were not in baggage claim, so we wasted two hours waiting in line to fill out forms regarding our lost luggage. Then we had to wait two full days before our bags arrived. We had the same experience on our way back from Rome to LAX. Again, we almost missed our connecting flight because the gate to our connecting flight was such a far distance, and not enough time to go through customs and take a shuttle. And AGAIN they lost our luggage. To make things even worse, they delivered the wrong bag to my house. I am beyond frustrated and angry! I would not recommend flying with Delta!",0
"The stupid service waiting for the luggage more than 3 hours, and still not have any staff come out to solve and give the reason. This is terrible service, since we have to fly again at next day 9am, waste our time for take rest.",0
"Amsterdam to Tenerife via Madrid with Air Europa, and this is the worst airline I've had in my life. A 7 hours delay, and they flew us to another airport. Had to take a bus and cab on own costs. Car rental company was also closed, so we had to take another cab to Tenerife North the next day. No compensation or ""sorry"" had been given by the airline. No more Air Europa for me.",0
Travelled to Lanzarote from Dublin return and was extremely impressed. Both flights left on time and the staff were helpful and courteous.,1
"They waited 30 minutes before our flight to let us know that it was delayed almost two hours, okay it happens, but the staff clearly did not want to be there. She rolled her eyes every time someone asked her anything , and was being very rude while checking bags to make sure they would fit under the seats. She was doing her job but in a very rude manner.  The attendant could have been nicer to my autistic son when telling him he needed to buckle. He didn't even know what what going on. My family and I will never take this airline again.",0
"Budapest to Tokyo via Beijing. Worst service ever. We were 4 hours late to Tokyo and we arrived at midnight, when there are no mass transportation. We had to take a night taxi for a lot of extra charge in order to get to our hotels. The stewardesses are not friendly either except if you're Chinese. And on top of that, our luggage got lost on our way home. I do NOT recommend this airline to anyone. Just save up more money and travel with a better one.",0
"I have flown with US Airways several times and each experience has been a nightmare! Every trip has had a flight delay by an hour or more. Customer service is always rude and no one cares to help you or help make your travels easier! I try to avoid flying with them as much as possible unless I know I have no choice. I recently traveled to PHX from Charlotte and they delayed my flight for over an hour because of a ""Maintenance"" issue. It's a nightmare and I will no longer choose to travel with US. Horrible service and constant delays!",0
Newark to London. Slight initial delay on the outbound journey but no real bother as it was under an hour. Very courteous staff. As a vegetarian I didn't expect much food wise but was pretty surprised at how good it was. Would use this airline again.,1
"After being stranded in CDG Airport by Vietnam Airlines I was thankfully able to book a flight home to Sydney in economy to make a family wedding. The cost, 4.2k, I can understand it's a high price to pay for a last minute flight that I booked a little over 12 hours in advance, but it's insulting to have an empty seat on the flight next to me and several other empty seats on the flight.  I paid an extra 90 euros to get into the business class lounge for my 13 hour layover, no where when I selected this option, informed me that the ticket is for only 6 hours in the business lounge.  My seat on the A388 was horrible, I was in front of the bathroom. I couldn't eat on the plane. My seat didn't recline properly, and the seat in front reclined further than the other seats in its row.",0
"Flew Newark to Paris. La Compagnie is terrible and a poor excuse for business class. The plane is old and worn, the lounge is cheap and overcrowded and the entire cabin smelled literally of urine. The staff were extremely rude, especially a staff member at Newark airport. Worst airline experience. I will never fly them again.",0
"Pisa to Istanbul. Turkish Airlines cancelled flight without even informing me. They offered full refund. That would have only costed me double the money, given the fact I did not want to be more late. I went to Pisa airport to get my tickets only to find out that I am not in the system even after changed information of my schedule. The staff took 4 hours to figure out this issue. They don't know how to do their job. Crew members would forget the last people on the seats and not serve coffee to us. I recommend not to use Turkish Airlines.",0
"London to Phoenix with British Airways in Premium economy. Possibly the worst customer service and flight attendants ever, both outward and inward flight. The plane was dirty, old and smelly. The cabin crew were rude, unhelpful with their customer service who simply ignore your complaints. British Airways should stand for budget airline.",0
Birmingham to Charleston with a layover in Atlanta. My flight took off 45 minutes late in Birmingham due to icing. We landed in Atlanta with fifteen minutes before my next flight took off. I was the last person to be seated on my connecting flight and a couple of minutes later the doors closed. Somehow those guys were able to get my luggage on my connecting flight. Thank you very much to the workers who were able to get my luggage to the next plane. Not having my luggage would have been very inconvenient.,1
"Allegiant Air canceled my flight in the last minute without any reasons. I tried to call their customer service but no one picked up, later on the phone was not even ringing. It was not because of bad weather or something. I tried to call and email later but no response at all. They just simply sent the email said the flight was canceled, not delayed, and it messed up my whole trip. We will never book our flights with Allegiant Air anymore, it has cheap prices for a reason. Very disappointed!",0
"I was booked from Adelaide to Auckland via Melbourne with absolute assurance at booking time that my bag could be checked right through as I am elderly and cannot handle my checked in baggage myself. Sadly, Qantas cancelled the morning flight and insisted I had at my own expense to therefore book a nights accommodation at Melbourne airport. Additionally they rudely refused to check my bag through to Auckland at checkin saying that it was impossible because I was not flying all the way on the same day. What sort of airline service is that? I will never travel Qantas again.",0
"Miami to Keflavik. My flight was delayed and then our connecting flight was canceled, therefore they denied us boarding. We were instructed to call customer service as there is no physical help desk, but of course no one answered. Many people were in this same situation. I filed a claim for tours and hotels booked, but they were dropped as well. No compensation was given.",0
"I flew to Hawaii from Las Vegas on Hawaiian Airlines. Only the ticketing and customer service are excellent. The flight's service was appalling. There was no options for vegetarian and vegan. I just napped on the plane from Honolulu to Las Vegas while they served dinner. They didn't bother to call me. When I inquired about food after 5 minutes, they abruptly informed me that no food will be served at this time. The strangest thing is that if I purchase with a credit card, they would deliver the food. This is inexcusable. During the journey, I only received a small amount of juice. The flight attendant was quite haughty and unprofessional. In general, they treat passengers as though they are travelling free of cost. In the future, I would not fly with Hawaiian Airlines.",0
HKG to Hangzhou with 0800 flight in C class. Arrived 45min prior to departure time and just made the flight in time as there were so many people queuing for immigration and security. Also our gate was at the new North Satelite Concourse which meant that we had to take a bus to reach the terminal. Flight attendants were efficient and friendly throughout the flight and handed us drinks and blankets before we departed. Breakfast was not too bad and service great. The aircraft was an A321 and had quite comfortable business class seats for a regional plane. We arrived early in Hangzhou and got our luggage fairly quickly. However the priority labels are not really usefull in China as they just throw out the first luggage which comes out. This is however not Dragonair's fault. Their inflight product is superior in comparison to their other rivals.,1
"Victoria to Boston via Montreal. Very poor interpersonal experience. Aircraft, facility etc are reasonable. It is the behaviour of staff that cause concerns. In food delivery service, the hostess decided to skip several rows, and when called for a drink, she pointed to the fact that we should have asked when they were delivering drinks! Our baggage was not delivered, The agent linked to US customs looked it up and found that it was delivered to another airport. He advised that we should contact the Baggage agent. The comment we received from the baggage agent were disturbing ""are you sure it was not delivered?"". I urge Air Canada to address these attitudes on part of its staff members.",0
"Denver to Atlanta. In all of my travels United has never taken off or landed on time, never. Their gate staff is  nasty and don't act like they care if fly with them or not. A horrible airline, I'll never fly with them again",0
Had flight cancellations due to weather going back home to Dublin from Gran Canaria. Most helpful customer care desk. Ryanair really did all they could to get us back home. Very courteous and polite. Even connection flight and seating was sorted. Made such a difference to a probably stressful situation.,1
"Cam Ranh to Ho Chi Minh City. Its the fifth time this year I fly this airline and always there is a huge delay, they have extreme problems with organisation short of staff and recently a lot of safety problems. If you're taking holiday in Vietnam, please choose another airline if you don t want your holiday disrupted. They do not care about their customers.",0
"If you are flying to Turkey from within the United States and vice versa I would not recommend Turkish Airlines unless you are flying out of one of their main hub airports like LAX, SFO or JFK. This is the fourth time in a row we have flown with Turkish Airlines where some portion of the domestic leg of our trip had a cancellation or delays with domestic carriers that Turkish Airlines does not take any responsibility for although we paid them for those flights. They also don't provide notice when the domestic carrier makes scheduling changes. This years debacle involved Turkish Airlines booking a connecting flight on Alaska Airlines from our home town to LAX where we were to board the Turkish Airlines flight to Istanbul. This flight was so delayed we had to book a separate flight on another carrier and then pick up and transfer our bags once we reached LAX in order to catch the Istanbul flight. When we contacted Turkish Airlines about this on the day of the delay they told us there was nothing they could do about it until the end of our trip. Now at the end of our trip I contacted Alaska Airlines who report that Turkish Airlines did not pay them for those tickets, and when I contact Turkish Airlines about getting reimbursed for the flight we paid for and never used I am getting the royal runaround. I have been flying with Turkish Airlines for more than 20 years, and although I have known for years that their customer service is absolutely lacking in anything resembling service things have gotten worse. I would recommend Lufthansa, United or American. The food is not as good as on Turkish Airlines but you will experience less headaches. Also, I would highly recommend Alaska Airlines. Although this was not at all their problem as this was a Turkish Airlines service failure, all of the Alaska Airlines employees we worked with were incredibly courteous, helpful and generous in helping me on the day of the trip and at the end as I seek to get a refund for the tickets we never used.",0
Mexico City to London. This was our fourth flight with Aeromexico in the last two weeks. Flying from London to Mexico City. Then to Huatulco. Then Oaxaca to Mexico City. And finally back to London. I can say that this is now probably one of my favourite airlines having travelled around the world for many years on many airlines. Friendly staff. Helpful. Very comfortable seats. Slept more on these planes than others. Great food and drink. Easy check in on their website or at airport. Good prices. Would recommend them as an airline. Surprised as their reviews are not so good so wasn't expecting much. But so happy to have used them. Best thing was the wonderful Tequila after their meals. It was an amazing taste. Great films.,1
This has been the worst travel experience I have had. My original flight was cancelled I was not informed of this until I arrived at the airport. This should be standard protocol to notify passengers that the flight is cancelled. On top of that the customer service is atrocious. As I was reasonably upset and asking customer service to find me another flight she tells me that the next flight to my destination is boarding now but you cannot get on it. They put me on a connecting flight to Chicago 4 hours later. 4 hours later all Chicago flights were delayed another 2 hours. Meanwhile flights are boarding all around me. I strongly advise you to stay as far away as possible from United.,0
"I had a horrible experience with Swoop. I missed my flight and was stranded in Toronto for days. I needed to check in an extra bag for my daughter and I was delayed at the counter until I missed boarding my flight by 2 minutes even after paying twice for the same bag. There was no empathy from any staff and was not put on another flight, I literally stayed at the airport from 6am to 7pm pleading for assistance on rescheduling but no one helped. The customer service is terrible and I was treated  badly, they concluded that missing my flight was my fault. I will never recommend them to anyone despite the cheap fares.",0
"Utterly disgusting experience. They are cheap and full of inconsiderate staff. They are not fit to be in the service industry as they lack compassion towards their customers. The supervisor at the airport did not allow me to get past the security line as my bag was 1 inch over the bag size allowed. He said ""I have to stand here all day if I have to deal with customers like you"". I had a basic economy ticket that allowed one bag under the seat and my bag fit perfectly under the seat as I have traveled on different other airlines with this bag placed under the seat. They made me pay for the bag and did not allow me to board. When called customer service for the refund of bag fee which I did not even check in, she was highly disrespectful to my request. American Airlines needs to train their employees about basic things like being polite, considerate and accommodating to customer needs and not forget that each customer has paid for the service. They displayed sheer cheapness at the airport!",0
"Minneapolis to Fort Myers. Used to be very good, now new ownership, tiny uncomfortable seats, crew seems to follow the take the money and run attitude by doing bare minimum, Don't fly this airline.",0
"I traveled Cathay Pacific Airways with my parents who aged 90 and 80 from Hong Kong to Taipei. My 90 year old Dad could walk to his seat onboard but needed wheelchair help in other areas in the airport. The crew was very friendly and helpful, helping my Dad to his seat and offered him food and drinks making him felt very homey. Thanks for the very kind and helpful crew on Cathay Pacific.",1
"Took a flight from Southwest last week to Las Vegas. Upon trying to return home from Las Vegas my flight was canceled because of equipment problems. There were no other connecting flights that day for my itinerary. As a result Southwest offered several alternatives. We stayed an additional night in Vegas as a result. This was paid for by Southwest. All transportation was supplied by Southwest to and from the hotel. This was first class service! My only peeve and it is a small one was that I had an ""A"" first on pass originally and my replaced flight the next day was a ""B"" category. The flight crew on all flights was excellent.",1
"Flew from Denver to Detroit. I've been flying Delta for years but will never again. From the time I initially booked to the 3 hours I've been waiting online because they messed up the tickets for my 2 daughters I am traveling with. It has been one mistake after the next. As I stand in the longest line I have ever seen, I listen to story after story of people that have had similar experiences. What a terrible airline. Never again.",0
"Flight from Nairobi to Kigali cancelled with no notice and no reason. Rebooked on later flight via Bujumbura. Stayed on the ground at Bujumburra for 2 hours. No luggage on arrival and no one cared. Phone call on a Saturday resulted in ""call back Monday we don't have staff to chase luggage on the weekend. In air service was good on all our Kenya Airways flights but poor schedule management and incredibly bad luggage management means I will not fly again if I can help it. Such a pity it could be a great airline.",0
My family and I were flying from Cancun to San Antonio with what was supposed to be a short stop in Houston. Because the plane departed late from Cancun we made it through the long lines and customs with 15 minutes left to make our gate. That is until they called me back and said they won't take my luggage. I asked why and was told there was not enough time. We told them we could easily make it to the gate and they refused to let us go. Instead we were sent to the ticket counter to. Rebook our flight. That is when we were told the flights were booked and we might not leave till the next day. They were not willing to work with us at all and it just infuriated us more. We asked to speak to the manager and he also came off as arrogant and took no responsibility for our situation. We ended up having words with him that got us nowhere. That was the last flight with United that we will take.,0
Stansted to Rhodes. Got to the airport and they charged me 40 for two cases because apparently I hadn't paid which i had the paper work to but they wasn't interested. By the time our cases were sorted and we got to the gate it had closed and the realised that check in desk hadn't gave us our boarding passes but we hadn't realised that because we were running against the clock to catch the flight. I would not recommend this airline.,0
"It was a great journey and experience flying with Spicejet. The cabin crew were very friendly and helpful. I also appreciate the before time arrival of the flight at the destinations, although there was a delay in departure from Jammu. Hope to travel soon again!",1
"Manchester to Barcelona via Frankfurt. The lounge used at Manchester was the Aspire, adequate but not amazing. The seat had adequate room I'm 6 1 and there was a good 2 inches spare. I was in seat 2f. The cabin crew were friendly the meal was served quickly. There was no choice. It was chicken with pesto and fruit salad. Tasted better than it sounds. With a mousse for pudding. There are lots of lounges at Frankfurt so easy to choose one close to departure gate. Lots of nice food to choose from so had some spicy chicken and cake. The next flight was fine with another nice crew but the same meal which was disappointing. Both planes were late in boarding but made up the time in flight. Priority boarding was recognised and and my luggage came off early.",1
"TAP Portugal moved the departure of my flight from Amsterdam to Lisbon by two hours. Therefore I could not take the connecting flight from Lisbon to Miami. Plus, even though they knew in advance, I was not notified. When I tried to check in and noticed the problem called their contact number. It took almost 20 minutes for a representative to take the call. He only offered moving the flight one day or taking the flight to Lisbon and waiting there if they ""could"" at some point book me with another airline. They did not offer booking me in advance with a partner airline so that I could get to Miami on time to see my family. Terrible service. I am extremely disappointed with that airline.",0
"We checked in at the airport in Edinburgh to no line and the attendant at the counter checked our bags. We were not asked if we wanted the bags checked through to IAD and the flight was the next day at 12.55. The previous flight EI3255 was just landing at Dublin. We had no bags, but because we were staying the night, we had a reservation at the Radisson. We have been sitting in the Dublin airport for 2.5 hours so they could find our bags. This is terribly inconvenient and I will go out of my way not to fly this airline again. No sense of urgency.",0
Terrible service! Our return took two days. Our first flight was overbooked and they printed the wrong paperwork. We were forced to spend the night in Madrid where they gave us one meal for a 24 hour delay. After our last flight didn't work out it took 3 hours in the airport to get new tickets and a hotel lined out. ,0
"Horrible, never want to fly Delta again. I had my Grandmothers funeral the day after we were supposed to get there. Our flight from Minneapolis to Alanta was delayed by 2 hours due to technical difficulties. I get that, sure. But the only people that were Helpful was Jeanne, the representative in Alanta who tried to help. She went as far as trying to help us get a rental, this woman needs a raise! Only reason didnt take it was cause it was so late at night and was afraid of wrecking. Delta got us a flight the next morning but I showed up late for my grandmothers funeral! Tried to contact Delta for a refund but all they wanted to give was a gift card. Never flying Delta again I'm sticking to Southwest",0
"Cape Town to Perth via Johannesburg. I broke my arm and needed to return to Perth for operation. When I requested a more comfortable seat on check in the staff complied. On boarding I discovered she had seated me next to toilet in a non recliner. The staff refused to attempt any change, a man stepped in and offered his seat.",0
Would never fly Ryanair again. Flew from Manchester to Rome. Despite checking in early we were allocated seats at opposite ends of the plane. When I phoned up they then 'sold' me the seat next to my husband! I understand that if you want to guarantee sitting together you need to pay for a seat but this is just a blatant money making venture. And the flight was late. Would not use again.,0
Just returned to HK from JFK on CX 831. As usual CX service food condition of the cabin etc. were all top notch and we had a great flight.,1
"Amsterdam to Barcelona. This is the worst airline there has to be. After paying triple the normal ticket for Optima ticket, our only carry on bag was taken from us to be put in the cargo because the cabin was full! It is your policy and I paid for it. Horrible seats. More than 40 minutes delay.",0
Had a wonderful experience flying Aer Lingus from Boston to Dublin and from Dublin to Chicago. Both trips were effortless and the customer service was top notch. Everyone was friendly and helpful. I also flew this airline between Dublin and Paris and had a positive experience as well.,1
"Chennai to London via Delhi with Air India. As one of the passengers trapped in Chennai Airport during the floods from the 1st to 5th of December, I was appalled at the treatment of passengers. We were given no food or water or blankets by the airline. The airline sent people out to the domestic terminal, which left them effectively locked out in the cyclone, and then barricaded off the window so that people could not contact them from outside. They shouted at passengers and refused to put passengers on the emergency evacuation list. They would just write ""total refund"" on the tickets and say they had absolved responsibility of us. The staff in Chennai airport did not show a shred of compassion or humanity. I understand it was exceptional circumstances but when things go wrong you cannot count on Air India to provide you with basic care or support.",0
"The flight was fine. I learned later that I could have booked it through SAS which is what everyone should do. I mistakenly paid for extra baggage i thought I was paying for but it turns out that this was included. I found the site confusing and so made a mistake. When I learned about this at the Oslo airport, no one at the the desk could correct the problem and they told me to contact customer service via chat or email. At Leknes I did contact, I was told it was company policy that you could not cancel an add on service. They would not evn let me cancel the unnecessary and what will be unused charge for the January 31 flight back to Oslo. Turns out the flight was joint with SAS and I used their app for boarding pass anyway. Book through SAS and get good service. Avoid Wideroe",0
Booked 10 months ahead unable to check in online. Called and was assured we had guaranteed seats. Arrived and checked in at the desk and went through to board. Told we had not seats. Only 2 out of 4 in our party were able to board after a long battle.,0
"My husbands flight was scheduled for 6 am. We got there to check in and the lady who was going to check us in was completely rude from the time we started to check in. My husband is a permanent resident here in the US so he can fly to Mexico with his residency card. This lady was not having it and said that he would not be able to come back into the country. After arguing about this for the next 20 mins, they finally said that he could fly. However, he would need another form of identification to go along with the permanent resident card. He had his Mexico passport but apparently that would not work. So they basically canceled our flight because we didn't have the correct documents. To top it off, they said they would not refund our money! Only a credit to fly with their airline, which will never happen! American Airline staff was absolutely horrible. I would not recommend this airline at all. My husband ended up getting on a flight with United Airlines. He has flown with them a couple times before and had absolutely no problems!",0
"This is my second time flying with United from the East Coast to LAX, and I was very satisfied with my experience both times. The planes are clean and modern, and the flight attendants attend to guests in economy seating the same way they attend to guests in first class. I also flew with my puppy the second time via their PetSafe program, and all the folks I was in contact with were very accommodating. I will definitely be flying United for future trips.",1
"Istanbul to Bodrum. The flight was delayed at first for 20min and every 20min for 20min more. In the end it was more than 3 and a half hours later until the plane took off. The Atlasglobal staff were coming to the gate one by one and since its a domestic flight I guess they supposed there were no foreign passengers and didnt give any explanation in any language but Turkish. I tried to ask the staff several times for information on the flight but the crowd was huge and everyone was yelling. The explanation was technical problems. The airline doesn't even have any complaint site to ask for compensation, their website in English crashes every time I open it. Extremely badly organised airline with very bad customer relations.",0
"I flew round trip between Copenhagen and Barcelona. My flight to Barcelona was delayed one hour, but boarding was quick once it began. Both flights were very smooth, and I had a great experience. I think checking in online helped, their check in opens 7 days before departure, and if you check in they already assign you a seat.",1
Manila to London. The flight was oversold and an A343 was used instead of Boeing 777. We spent 1hr on the runway queuing for takeoff. No real explanation was given. No cold drinks or towels provided. There was no built in in flight entertainment. The iPad substitute was a good gesture but the myplay platform frequently glitches out for 30 mins at a time and limited battery life restricts useage. Landing late without explanation or apology I missed my connecting bus. The worst food of any flight I've ever been on. The staff were good natured and friendly. Don't usually review but there was too many failures with this flight not to say something.,0
DR2264 DE4265 Business Class. Just arrived in Frankfurt from a return trip to Mombasa. Condor Business Class on the 767 is second to none! Fabulous food service and all round high quality. Highly recommended!,1
"My 13 year old son was scheduled to fly out of JFK back to London with Kuwait Airways, got to the airport four hours ahead, it took the ground staff five hours to communicate back to passengers that the flight in question would not leave that night. Asked to see a manager to whom I explained my situation, as I was also on holiday but was booked on a different flight on a different day, as my son arrived before me and was scheduled to leave New York in two days. I was told that my son had a seat reserved for him with American Airlines the next day. We went off and arrived the next day only to be told that my son had not been booked on the flight, we were sent back to Kuwait Airways as I was now becoming very desperate. After much argument and refusing to leave, they managed to put him on a 7 hour transit flight.  Very poor customer service.",0
Delighted with recent flight London Heathrow to Mumbai via Muscat. The entertainment and food were excellent as was service. We were given a huge bag of nuts and some ice cream in addition to two meals on the 7 hour flights to and from Muscat. There wasn't much to do at Muscat airport for our 5 hour stop so take a good book if you have a long stop there!,1
"Moline to Salt Lake City via Denver. I had a very unpleasant experience with United Airlines on September 18, 2017. I was told that because I was two minutes late, my seat was reassigned. It was unclear that I had to be at the gate 30 minutes prior to my departure and if I were late my seat would be reassigned. On my confirmation email, it clearly states that my seat will be automatically assigned prior to boarding and can't be changed once they're assigned. Thus, I had to take the next flight at 5AM. When I was on my flight the next morning, I asked the flight attendant if I could move two rows back because the plane was not to capacity and it would be more comfortable for both myself and the gentleman next to me. I was told by the flight attendant that, ""They had already made a count and that the weight distribution would be off"". Having flown previously, I've moved seats before with no issue. Because of these experiences, I don't feel that United Airlines values their passengers and therefore, I will no longer book with them.",0
"Seattle to Amsterdam, a 10 hour flight and my wife and I are not even sitting next to each other on Christmas Eve. Unacceptable Delta does not honor preferred seat request even if tickets are bought 4 months in advance. Very poor customer service. People at the desk are nice just doing there jobs. I will never fly with Delta again even if the long haul flight was free. Watch out for operated by. Sorry KLM and Air France, you guys lost my money as well.",0
"The worst customer service ever, incredibly unsatisfied. Hopefully nothing happens with your fly, otherwise you will not find anyone to help you. If you lose your luggage good luck with that. It took them 11 days to answer to me without a real information. Probably the worst company I ever traveled with.",0
"Beirut to Barcelona via Belgrade. Worst flights ever! They took me all around Europe due to the connecting flights that they delayed and missed! Time is disrespected! We were like bunch of beggars at the counter in Belgrade where staff maltreated us, as if we were garbage.",0
"Worst company ever, I was book a flight in April for 28th June since they are open three flights a week from Malta to Belgrade on Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday, I planned everything for the flight on Tuesday from Malta and to return on Thursday back from Belgrade since I couldn't get more than two days on my work. They first change my flight time and move for a few hours before, and then for the day before departure and the day after arriving back in Malta so now I need to cancel or move all my schedule and they give me a big problem for everything and if I cancel no refund of my money, which is not my fault and I don't see why I need to pay for it because they are not even asked me before changing it or offer me refund or some other flight in the same day. This is last time I will fly with this company.",0
"Montreal to Toronto. We had missed our earlier flight due to another airline having short delay. However, WestJet was able to accommodate us and bumped us to a flight two hours later. Ground staff was friendly and helpful. Flight attendants were friendly and onboard service was good. Flight was uneventful.",1
"Flew Thomas Cook Airlines from Manchester to Miami return in economy. Both flights left pretty much on time. Plenty of space in seats, entertainment selection very good. Cabin crew very friendly and chatty and worked hard. Meals were excellent, probably the best airline food I have tasted. ",1
"Washington to Miami via Washington. The flight to Miami was pretty good. Staff were courteous and attentive. The flight back was extremely disappointing. The seats were smaller and on an older model plane, and the staff barely attended to us. The nuts were lukewarm, and our trays were not emptied until the flight was almost over. The staff was more interested in talking to each other and playing on their phones than assisting anyone on the flight. Needless to say, we will not be flying American Airlines ever again. The service and level of comfort is vastly different than what we experienced on United Airlines and we will not be choosing American Airlines for future travel.",0
Hong Kong to Tbilisi via Almaty. A horrible and awful experience I ever met. Unprofessional ground crew and poor arrangement of delayed flight. I wont take Air Astana again and wont recommend.,0
"Tokyo Narita to Hong Kong on economy class with ANA. The service is best. Boarding was efficient and flight attendants were very friendly. The ground service is best, and Food and beverages is good. This journey is very comfortable. Highly recommended.",1
Flew premium economy from LHR to JFK. Overall it was a very pleasant experience. Very amenable and attentive cabin crew good food and a comfortable seat. I would highly recommend.,1
"Cairo to Toronto via Kiev. After 1 hour in the air, they announced that there is a defect in the engine. We had to land in Turkey. There was no meals even though the flight was over 8 hours long. The crew were trained to be rude and were very good at ignoring passengers and giving them bad looks for asking for water. There were two washrooms available. One had no water. This was truly a flight from hell. We arrived to Toronto extremely thirsty and exhausted.  Very sad flight. Please find any other flight.",0
Honolulu to Hilo. I flew Hawaiian on their B717 last March. I knew that the B717 was not a large aircraft and the flight was only 40 minutes long so I was not expecting much. I was pleasantly surprised by the service and seats. The flight attendants were very fast if you asked for something and they were kind. The seat was pretty comfortable and there were only two seats on my side of the isle. I will definitely fly with them again.,1
"Really bad airline start to finish. Check in under staffed, no social distance control and rude ground staff. We booked a flight together but when we got our tickets they put us in Seat A and C with gap of middle seat. They told me the flight was full and we had no choice. I pointed out that no one likes to sit in the middle seat, so why not give them the window or aisle, so we as a couple are together. They were rude and says that's our allocated tickets. We will never travel AirAsia again.",0
Amsterdam to Athens. A friend and I missed our flight due to unforeseen circumstances and the KLM transfer lady went out of her way to accommodate us. She was super nice and understanding. We received outstanding customer service and would greatly recommend this airline to anyone.,1
"Toronto to Istanbul via Cairo. The food is very bad, and the flight crew were rude to me. When I went to ask for a glass of water since they only give beverages twice during the 12 hour flight, the air hostess was aggressive and started making stupid gestures . Also Egyptair staff at the transit office in Cairo airport are disrespectful when we approached them to talk about our seats.",0
"These flights were a nightmare, worst flights in the years. On Marseille airport there was a IT issue on the check in desk and therefore we were waiting a lot of time to be solved. On the first flight the cabin attendant forget to serve chocolate to several people including me. On arrival in Frankfurt we were blocked in the airplane for more than 30 min due to lack of people to maneuver the mobile stairs.. On Frankfurt airport remained in the bus more than 15 minutes because nobody answered from the plane.. Despite the fact that people were ready to fly on time the flight had 50 min delay due to lack of people to charge the luggage. Lufthansa became a very low quality flight company.",0
"I was travelling American Airlines from Quito to MIA for summer holiday. Such a short trip, but two hours delay on departure that cause me missed the tour with friends. Very disappointed. On my return back to Quito, three hours wasted at the airport, again delayed. Worst experience with American Airlines. I have been using American Airlines since 2010, I was happy with the service, not anymore. Delays were never announced.",0
Our flight was cancelled and the unhelpful employee at the front counter through a piece of paper at me with directions on rebooking with another airline. He offered no help whatsoever. Of course rebooking our flight on another airline cost us 1000 to rebook. They gave us vouchers which only covered 800 of it. So because of them I am out an extra 200 plus dollars. Will never fly them again. Terrible service.,0
"Kolkata to Doha on 7 September. The flight scheduled to depart at 0330 was delayed and nobody informed passengers that the flight was delayed to 8am in the morning and we have been obliged to spend the night at airport. The delay was not announced. The Qatar staff at Kolkata airport did not show up until very late. If the staff was there at 12am they should have offered to us to spend the night in a hotel, but when they arrived was obviously too late. I received the next morning at 10.22 am the message on my phone that the flight was delayed, i.e. after the flight had already left.  I wrote a letter of complaint to the airline but no compensation was offered. I requested a diabetic meal and they forgot it.",0
"Calgary to Vancouver. I found WestJet Airlines an overall great airline and an amazing experience! Awesome crew, good foods, But not very good inflight entertainment, This is probably my favourite Canadian airline, I would suggest it to  people.",1
"Brussels to Delhi via Kiev. My flight from Brussels got delayed by 2 hours and post that my connecting flight from Kiev also got delayed by 7 hours. They don't have a designated customer desk at the airport, they share the desk with other airlines and most of the time UIA staff is unavailable at the desk. Your flight is delayed, its none of there fault, they won't even give you the food coupon or any access to any lounge where you can sit peacefully. They do not have a designated lounge at the Kiev Airport so you have to just look for open seats at the airport. I tried to talk to the staff a million times, but they just simply negated the issue by saying that they have no information, i have to wait no matter what. I am highly disappointed by there service and customer behavior. I recommend, if you are flying by UIA, just be prepared to be surprised in a negative way.",0
"As an international airline Virgin Atlantic charge for many items that are normally included. Also, I paid extra in order to get an extra leg room exit row window seat. However they bumped me to non exit row, aisle seat when I had specifically paid for and requested an extra leg room, window, exit seat. When I requested an explanation, as well as a refund, I was had to deal with such a rude representative, who refused to allow me to speak to his supervisor. ",0
"Chang Mai to Koh Samui via Bangkok with Bangkok Airways. For the price of the flight I was delighted by the service that we received. Our flights were only an hour each yet we got access to a lounge at the airport with snacks, free WiFi and drinks. There was an inflight meal and drinks on the plane. There service was outstanding and out of 3 flights we took with them within 1 week we had no delays or issues. Would fly with them again.",1
Albany to Orlando. Leg room is tight seats not spacious but neither are they overly uncomfortable. Service was excellent. Humorous dialogue and an over all sharp wit one staff member was funny. He alone would make me choose Southwest again but the airline also provided a good value and pleasant trip overall. Free snacks and beverage was a nice change from some other airlines as well.,1
"Worst airline experience ever. The most unprofessionally run, amateur outfit I have encountered after 3 million miles flown and 70 countries. Will never fly this airline again. A true embarrassment to the industry.",0
"I am one dissatisfied Egyptair customer. I booked 2 roundtrip tickets Istanbul to Cairo on the Egyptair website. Travel was scheduled for April 2015. Because of bombings in Cairo, Sharm el Sheik, Alexandria later the week of March 11, my Egyptian host and I decided we should cancel the trip since those were our destinations. I cancelled the tickets in the computer on March 16th. I cannot get any response from Egyptair even though I have tried for months. Don't book your trip with Egyptair because if you cancel the tickets for good cause, you will not get any money back nor will anyone from Egyptair have the courtesy to answer phone calls and emailed messages. ",0
"Shenzhen to Bangkok. We travel to Bangkok every six months with a stopover in Shenzhen. We must commend China Southern Airlines this trip. From the moment we checked our luggage in at Shenzhen, to when we got to the boarding gate, the staff were very friendly, efficient and looked after us very well. They spoke very good English. The seats were very comfortable and plenty of leg room. The meals were edible and a variety of beverages. Overall, the flight was very comfortable. We have been flying with China Southern Airlines for at least seven years now and would recommend them. We are also very impressed with the generous luggage allowance on international flights. Looking forward to our next flight.",1
"Paris Orly to Porto with Vueling Airlines. I honestly had such low hopes for this airline after reading other reviews. But I had no problems at all. The staff at the airport were nice, the staff in the air were nice. Every thing was normal and the flight was smooth. I would give them another go.",1
"The shuttle bus dropped us the passengers at the hanger! The flight from Lagos to Port Harcourt was scheduled at 3pm then rescheduled to 6pm, then again moved to 8.30 and I'm writing this as I board the flight at 9.31 pm. The bus driver who picked us up at mm2 boarding gate dropped us at the hanger and then left stating he has to go home. Serious action should be taken against such irresponsible employees and the airline should be charged a penalty for such negligence while recruiting junior staff. It is not even funny how close we were to another aircraft which was so loud that we had to close our ears. Delay for Arik isn't uncommon but such careless behaviour is unacceptable. I won't be travelling this airline ever again. Apart from no communication for the delay the airline is as worst as it can get in the aviation industry. They have set a new low for themselves.",0
"This has to be the worst airline I have ever travelled on. They lost all 3 of my bags, then 2 turned up 4 days late. The last one has never been found and its not been a month and they are dragging their feet about paying me compensation for my loss of bag as well as having to buy items when I got to Perth with nothing. I would never fly with this airline again and would never tell anyone to get on a plane with them.",0
"I reserved a booking for 40 dollars for the 3rd September 2021. When I tried to pay online, it gave me an error message. When I called customer support, they charged me an extra 100 dollars, saying it's pretty much not their problem and it's a service charge for them helping me pay for a ticket I already reserved for a set price. I paid and then called back, and they said the payment did not go through even though it left my bank. I have used Turkish Airlines 5 times before, and this is the last time. When I asked them about my refund of the 40 dollars, they said I had to make a complaint online. Bad customer support, bad systems and a bad company.  They also don't understand English or Russian fully. I spoke to them on the phone for 50 minutes, trying to talk to them in Russian and English, and they had difficulty understanding. I initially flew to Kazakstan with Air Astana and just booked tickets back with them.",0
I flew from Brussels to London Heathrow on an A320. The aircraft was about three quarters full. Boarding was smooth and we left and arrived slightly early. The sale of food and drinks went well and didn't appear to have much of a take up on this flight of less than an hour. Crew were good.,1
"Lisbon to Luton. Bought 2 priority tickets online. But still they make us pay in the airport. Staff very rude, very bad service, what they say in the site is not true. They charge money for no reason. Very bad flight and service.",0
"Mumbai to New York via Kuwait. The flight was 2 hours late coming into JFK, 6 hour layover in Kuwait airport going and 18 hour layover on Kuwait coming back. Flight was delayed by another 2.5half hours at Kuwait airport. Total 20.5 hours. Seems like the crew is not trained to help customers with the connecting flights and I experienced further delays so I missed my connecting flight. Also they do two stopovers coming from Mumbai, but you are told only about one. They jerk you and are not truthful about who to contact to try to help you. At JFK airport the Kuwait Airways staff said they are not responsible for me missing my flight, even though the flight was late. Kuwait airport has only two stores and they are very expensive compared to the USA. The amount of layovers and delays with this airline is not worth the money saved. You are better off going with another airline.",0
The desk worker at the gate went out of her way to help her name was Andibell Peralta. She got us on a earlier flight last minute. It was a stressful situation and she was kind and calm. I was very impressed and will definitely keep flying Delta. Her customer service skills were top notch.,1
"Canceled my flight due to coronavirus and they now refuse to refund my funds. This companies coronavirus policy is taking advantage of people. They keep their money, don't fly the plane thus no fuel or operating costs and refuse to refund. The Fed should never give this airline a bailout. Just look at their recent reviews .. JetBlue is acting unethically!",0
"Mumbai to Kigali via Dar es Salaam. The staff service was good and the flight in good condition, that's the only good part. When we landed in Dar es salaam we came to know that our baggage has not arrived and we would have to wait longer. Not only that non of the passengers who were traveling with us from Mumbai received theirs. On further enquiry came to know that they have failed to board the luggage of all the passengers traveling from Mumbai. Really disappointed. It's been a day and since not got any information regarding the same. Will never travel with Rwandair nor would I recommend this flight to anyone. Customer service and communication pathetic.",0
Edinburgh to Kuala Lumpur via London. I have just returned to KL from an extended visit in UK seeing family and friends. My return flight was BA033 from Heathrow to Kuala Lumpur on Monday 26th August 2019 at 21.10. I was greeted by the most delightful air hostess whose name I didn't quite catch. The point I wish to make is that she looked after me so well on the flight. She was exceptional. It really made the journey one of the best on board experiences I have had.,1
Bali to Dubai. The customer service is amazing and so patient. Mustufa from their Dubai customer center just helped me out flawlessly. Our line got disconnected before the changes were completed and he was amazing enough to complete everything and send me a confirmation email!,1
"Worst airline I have ever flown with. Their business class product is the pits. The staff are rude and unhelpful. The food is non existent virtually and during an 11.5hr flight I got no dinner just a miniscule starter and dessert. They said I ordered fish which I would never have done. Snacks consisted of crisps, peanuts and a few sweets.  The new Finnair seat is uncomfortable and only has 2 positions bolt upright or completely flat. The shoulder seat belt was too tight and digs in. The cabin looks nice but that's not much help if your seat is uncomfortable. The lounge at Helsinki is really awful too. No food to speak of but what there is like pasta and potato hotpot is cheap and nasty. They have a bar, no branded drinks and you have to wait for the bar staff to return to get served.  I would recommend anyone over Finnair, it's extremely poor value.",0
"Will do everything possible to never fly on this airline again. Staff were beyond rude to almost mean for no reason. Horrible customer support. Slow, incompetent, and overall clueless. Delay after delay with no explanation. Nobody offering to help and an overall very rude group of staff we encountered. There were so many ways the situations could have been improved but they did nothing but make it worse.",0
London to Osaka via Incheon and was very impressed. The service was outstanding with large amounts of good quality food and drink. The entertainment system offered a good choice but was not 'on demand'. The seats were comfortable and there was plenty of legroom and storage space. The staff were always around smiling and helpful. We had to wait 3 hours for the connection at Incheon airport but that was pleasant as it is large and clean with lots of shops and the Asiana lounge is comfortable and provides refreshments.,1
"I arrived at the airport at 4.50 am my flight was at 6.00am. After waiting in the main line for 10 minutes, one of the staff at check in says Miami, and makes a come this way hand gesture so my wife and I left the line we were at and went around to the line the staff that called for Miami was at. After getting to that line the staff called for the Orlando flight and took those passenger ahead, we waited in line. After finally getting to the staff, he told us the gate had closed, there was nothing he could do. Because of the misguidance, the lack of communication, and incompetence of the staff we lost our flight, car rental, and hotel. The manager we spoke to said that the staff called for Miami several times, we only heard them call for Miami only once.",0
Manila to LA and the flight was great. Staff were hospitable. Most impressive was how they handled a delay. My Manila to Seoul flight was delayed and I was going to miss my connection on arriving they had staff waiting to meet passengers and direct them to connections as fast as possible and had held up connecting flights so everyone could make flights. My flight was also delayed into LA where I had another connection. Once again there were staff waiting for us so they could direct and usher us as fast as possible to other connections.,1
"Delhi to New York. My flight to FK was good, with no problems. However on the return flight, I was not given my confirmed seat of 18D and instead was placed in a middle seat 30J. I explained that I need to get up frequently, but I was told that the ground crew made the change. The entertainment system did not work. Flight attendant came by and made one attempt to fix it by pushing the same buttons I had been pushing. Most importantly, they did not have my Gluten Free meal. I was told that it needed to be ordered ahead of time. I showed my eticket that said Gluten Free confirmed. The Flight attendant then brought me a meal that was not marked Gluten Free. She assured me it was ok, but could not tell me all the ingredients. I explained that if I ate something with gluten I would be very sick. She did try her best, and brought me fruit, but I was not able to eat a proper meal for the duration of the flight.",0
"First leg from Malaga to Barcelona more than three hours delay, when I finally arrived in Nice with a further more than one hour delay my bag went missing. It took them nearly three days before I got it back. Information was useless and even though there are many flights a day between the airports used their logistics are terrible. Vueling Airlines to be avoided at all cost. Last year they also lost my bag between Barcelona and Naples.",0
"Hong Kong to Amman via Abu DhabiThey told me that my ticket can enjoy a stay in hotel as my transit in Abu Dhabi international airport was 11 hours. I was surprised when i got off the plane and headed straight toward customer service counter telling me my ticket is illegible, so I had to pay by myself for hotel reservation. Was surprised of food quantity for 7.5 hour flight.",0
I will never fly AA again. Dirty planes packed to the brim. No mask enforcement. No distancing. No nothing. Lip service to safety only. They just want your money. They don't care about your well being or your experience. This much is plain.,0
I travelled to Perth Australia on the 17th December and returned to the UK on the 11th January. This was the best flight I have been on in many years the staff were excellent so helpful and even helped me with my hand luggage where many other flights will not do this. I would recommend them to anyone.,1
Barcelona to London Stansted. Terrible! Flight was more than 2 hours delayed. There was lack of information and really bad service from the staff. Overall a terrible experience! Can not believe that this is no. 1 airline in Europe.,0
Very poor service. I had to leave to Bahrain from London on 9th September. The daily flight was delayed from 2 hours to more than 5 hours after checking the status for more than a month. Airline denied to provide lounge access after we waited a long time in the Airport.,0
I want to thank AA for making it almost impossible to use their miles. We can't even get flights from PNS to Providence without having to spend hours and hours of waiting when there are actually direct connecting flights. They purposely complicate your travel. We have the answer. We are done with AA and will only use them as a last resort. What a shame.,0
"Auckland to Kunming via Guangzhou with China Southern, and a pleasant, efficient and helpful crew. Seats are reasonably comfortable with pillows and blankets. Entertainment options extensive and provide good distraction for those who cannot sleep in a sitting up position, even with some recline. Food is adequate and tasty with a range of snacks available between meals on long flights. Drink options are plentiful and crew circulated during the flight with trays of juice or water. China Southern provides good value.",1
"Booked through Air New Zealand Star Alliance, flight got cancelled and only got notified once at the airport. Shocking service from both Air New Zealand and Virgin. Should have arrived in the Gold Coast mid afternoon, will now arrive around 2.30am. Have lost money in pre paid accomodation and childcare but got told refunding our tickets wasn't even an option. Neither airline wanted to know about it. I would not recommend using Air New Zealand's Star Alliance service, very unimpressed with the lack of care factor for the passengers time and loss of money.",0
"I had an outstanding experience with this airline flying three routes from BLR to HYD, then HYD to LKO and then LKO to BOM. All three flights left right on time and arrived early to their destination. Check in was easy at airport and used their app for boarding passes and check in. On board the crews were polite and worked swiftly to serve passengers. I am unsure why all of the negative reviews, this airlines is leagues above any US carrier.",1
I recently returned from a trip to Barbados with Virgin Atlantic and I can say I will certainly use them again. I booked premium economy both ways and was more than happy with the whole experience. Checking in at Gatwick with dedicated desk for premium meant we were straight through no problem. On board upstairs in jumbo given glass of bubbly as I took my seat loads of room to stow stuff and good inflight DVDs food not bad either. Returning was also excellent had the front 2 seats upstairs again couple drinks before dinner and slept for a while. Overall a good experience with Virgin and I would recommend premium economy no problem.,1
"Friendly staff at Check in and nice crew member on flight. Aircraft was clean. Every traveler got a little bag with socks, toothbrush, eye mask and ear plugs, blanket and a pillow. Good food, range of drinks including a wide range of alcohol beverages. ",1
"My first time flying with SWISS from Brussels Airport to Belgrade Airport via Zurich. On the first flight from Brussels to Zurich I flew with Helvetic Airways with Embraer 190. The flight was on time and the crew were great. They served little snack and drinks. Great plane and we landed on time. The second flight from Zurich to Belgrade was with Swiss and the plane was an A220. That was for me a surprise, the plane has great leg room and very comfortable flight. The crew also was great and served us with snack and drinks. The departure was late, the reason was traffic jam over Europe. I recomended the Swiss and Helvetic because thay are really proffesional. I would flight with them again in future.",1
"TK69 Bangkok to Istanbul on 7 July, Business class cabin full however the purser and his team performed magnificently. They were all busy, however maintained a very friendly attitude to passengers. It has the best airline food in the world. After changing planes at Istanbul the same standard of service and food on the Istanbul to Manchester flight. ",1
Overnight flight from Heathrow to Sao Paulo. As I was on crutches when booking in we asked for extra leg room seats which we were given. Flight was brilliant with constant attention by cabin crew bring drinks and choice of food which was very good.,1
Stansted to Rhodes on 14th September 2013 returned on 28th September 2013. Very pleased with everything flight on time easy check in friendly staff lots of leg room in economy would thoroughly recommend no problems at all. First time travelling with Ryanair.,1
We were standing in line at the airport waiting to check in 2 hours before the flight due to a disabled child travelling and I received a text telling me our flight was cancelled due to weather. All other airlines were on time except Tiger who thought it reasonable to notify me with an SMS informing me I am also not entitled to a refund due to weather! Need I say more?,0
On 20 April 2020 I booked a flight with Vueling Airlines for 3rd June from Seville to Stockholm. It was the only airline which publicly advertised on its webpage that if the flight gets cancelled due to the new pandemic restrictions A FULL REFUND will be provided. I have also called the company and got a confirmation about it. Now almost 1 year later they did not provide me with any service and decline to give a refund saying they don't have to give a refund and ignoring my case!  On 11th May 2020 the flight got cancelled and the date moved to 2 weeks later. This continued to happen up until the 7th July. The company provided no solutions and caused me major extra expenses! When cancelling my booking due to the flights they kept cancelling I was only offered the option for a voucher or nothing else. They eliminated the option for a refund!,0
Toronto to Ottawa. The Pilot was flying out to Ottawa and overheard my conversation and distress of having to get to Ottawa General as my husband was in a coma. I was not sure where to go or how to get there and was worried about how long it would take till I was by my husbands side. This pilot came over to me and offered to bring me to the hospital once he landed the plane as he finished his shift and was going home as he lived in Ottawa. I want say thank you as I was overwhelmed and it took some ease and stress off me from the flight knowing I would not have to worry how I would get to the hospital after the flight. He was very humble and offered me assistance if I need anything while I was in Ottawa. I thanked him for his gracious act of kindness and want to ensure that he gets recognized for doing such a good deed. Air Canada you have a very special pilot. Thank you so much.,1
"Flew Newcastle to Birmingham with Eastern Airways for the first time today, and found the flight comfortable and flight attendant polite, courteous and professional. The plane was loud but that's to be expected for a small plane. I would definitely recommend and fly again with them.",1
"London Stansted to Warsaw with Ryanair. Charged extra because bag had wheels despite being in wight limit, employee rolled eyes and said ""It's Ryanair you have to pay for everything"". The plane was horrible and the entire experience was disgraceful.",0
"Bangalore to London via Doha. The Qatar Airways Qsuite seems like an awesome product but there wasn't any space for my bag storage. The service from Bangalore was top notch and impeccable. Yet again the cabin crew make all the difference. Unfortunately a delay at Doha due to the late arrival of the aircraft, but had the usual 1x2x1 layout with no Q suite. However a special mention to cabin crew from Thailand who was the real star of this five star airline. Extremely polite, superb service on board and hats off to her. Unfortunately the food quality at the Al Mourjan lounge seems to be declining.",1
Short trip with one layover. Flight cancelled and rebooked on short notice to very inconvenient time. The two delayed flights. Nonexistent customer service. Even in their home airport there is no help desk. Rude and inflexible staff at the airport. I would advise against using KLM if at all possible. I have only heard bad things about their so called customer service.,0
PG937 from Bangkok to Phnom Penh. Thursday 27th November 2014. 9pm. Flight was 45 minutes late. Interior and seat of plane was dirty. Black marks on windows tatty plastic. They took us by bus from gate to plane. The staff did their best but had little information.,0
London to Manila via Kuwait. I was very nervous after reading the reviews on here. However I have to say they were fantastic. The other passengers were a nightmare and I can see why the staff get the hump. The way they were treated was criminal.,1
". If I actually was on the plane, I could give a better review. I book the flight through orbitz. But unlike most airlines that confirm booking automatically, Spirit requires you to verify with their actual site as well.  That was a pain in the butt. Moving towards the day of the flight. 5 hours before my flight, I get an email and it's said it was cancelled. That's a joke. The reason was air traffic which is ridiculous. It was supposed to be an overnight flight. I book a flight with American at their desk with no problem. I will say I did write to them what happened. A nice lady got back to me and apologized. They are giving me a refund which is nice. But not a good experience.",0
"To enter St. Lucia, on a very long awaited Caribbean vacation, we had to jump through a lot of hoops online, because of Covid restrictions. Arriving at the airport in Hartford at 3am on Sunday, December 5, we found that we had not printed out the final authorization from the government authorizing our entry into the country, though it was on our phones. The Station Manager was ever so patient and kind and smart, because it was not easy to download them, and print them on Delta's printer, which we sent using her email. After quite a bit of trying, she met us at the gate to continue attempts until she finally succeeded in printing the forms out for us. She literally saved our vacation. The rest of the Delta staff, on all 4 legs of our trip, coming and going to St. Lucia were also patient, courteous and professional. The flights were clean and on time and reasonably comfortable. They had Peloton meditation and chair yoga videos as part of their on line entertainment, which I enjoyed. In this very stressful time for air travel, it is nice to have only good things to say about these flights, and this airline. We plan to switch our frequent flyer mile credit card to them. The snacks and beverage were standard airline basic but the people serving them were great.",1
They changed my flight which wouldn't work for me and won't refund my tickets. I have been on the phone with them for 11 months and every time they say a refund is being processed. Now every time I call its a new excuse. Last excuse was too much time has passed even though I started the refund process or ROR as they call it. Every time being on hold for well over an hour.,0
"Myself and 14 others are stranded in Vegas because our plane left early. I came in from Indianapolis. Was supposed to transfer on this plane and take it to San Diego airport tonight. Now all of us have to spend the night in the airport they will not give us any rooms or any food. I am a single girl and this is unacceptable. Spirit Airlines said it was related to bad weather which is absolutely a lie, the weather is absolutely perfect, their plane left early. Unbelievable, we are all outraged. Do not fly Spirit Airlines.",0
Raleigh to Houston. I will never fly Frontier again. I understand there can be difficulties but today was a disaster. Instead of leaving us sitting in the lobby they decided to board all of us onto the plane and leave us sitting for 2 hours. And gave us one excuse after another. Two hours later we arrive at our destination to delayed again. Never again,0
"This was the first time I was going to fly ever. I bought tickets for my boyfriend and I to see my dying grandmother one last time and I wasn't ever informed that my flight was changed at first, then cancelled! My boyfriend and I were at the airport waiting for the plane before asking someone why Interjet wasn't coming up on the screen. after being told there were not Interjet flights I called Interjet and they confirmed that the flight was cancelled. I was shocked and had to scramble to get home and figure out what to do. Both my boyfriend and I have been calling multiple times daily and at first I got an answer, now it sounds like they have the phone off the hook! I've been waiting for a response to emails and calls. Never ever going though them or recommending ever!",0
"Kuala Lumpur to Bali. Our 1030 departure had a 7h delay. It took over an hour for staff to come to the gate to explain that the flight was delayed and to deal with customers. There were 3 of us that wanted to remove our baggage, be refunded and hop over to the other terminal to take a 1230 MAS flight to Bali instead but AirAsia took so long to get staff we realised we would never make it. Staff agreed to move us to a 1615 Air Asia flight to Bali however we had to go back outside to the chaos of baggage drop and immigration. After standing fighting for another hour, they eventually agreed to move our luggage over to the new flight without us having to do it all ourselves. They refused us access to the pod hotel in the departure lounge or their Lounge. They provided one bottle of water for 7h and offered a KFC in that time. Staff pushed us around the houses to talk to operations managers to try and obtain lounge access to relax.",0
I flew from London to Kuala Lumpur in August I have always flown MAS. Another great flight on time both ways. I only have praises for the very friendly and pleasant cabin crew. Drinks were served every hour and the food as fantastic. Inflight entertainment was great.,1
"This airlines don't respect thier passengers, my flight was late for one hour, after gathering passengers for boarding they discover that they don't have a staff for this flight, after one hour they call to start boarding again, passenger stand in a queue and they let us waiting for more 30 min.",0
VA is considered a budget airline but I regularly fly Emirates to Sydney on an A380 meal ICE entertainment system etc for a similar price. Emirates do not fly to Denpasar and do not connect with VA so I booked VA from AKL. Dopey tiered fare structure poor communication appalling customer service. I asked for same service as Emirates meal tea coffee movies. Received tea only. Later told it was my fault for asking for the services I wanted not researching and booking the correct fare tier. Ridiculous. 6.5 hour flight Denpasar to Brisbane horrendous air con not working properly stifling hot suffocating at front where I sat. Cabin freezing at rear passengers asked for blankets. Arrived Brisbane tried to change seat worst customer service experience. I will be flying to Denpasar but I will travel via another Asian country rather than direct with VA.,0
"Due to the Covid 19, I had to cancel a flight to Nairobi. The cancellation was done on time early march. Well Kenya Airways refuses to refund my ticket and proposes a voucher to be used in the next twelve months. On top of that no one responded to my email for over a month. I really believe that this is not acceptable.",0
"Gold Coast to Christchurch. Very pleased with our return flight with Jetstar both legs were on time the plane was spotless, and the service and friendliness of the crew were exemplary.",1
"We had a long layover in Toronto caused by a flight change by WestJet two weeks after we made the reservations. We asked the company to accomodate us on a early flight and the gentlemen at the kiosk named Llewellyn was a real help. He was very polite, professional and patient and was able to help us. Thanks so much Llewellyn.",1
"Extremely uncomfortable. I am 6' tall with very long legs and my husband is 6'3"". I felt like I was in a box. I had the middle seat and couldn't move at all. Thank goodness the seats didn't recline because the person in front of me would have been in my lap. My husband and I shared a large suitcase to avoiding having to pay for 2 bags but we ended up having to pay extra anyway because the bag was overweight. We will not be flying Spirit anymore. It was not a positive experience.",0
"Having purchased a business ticket at a rather hefty price I was surprised to learn the aircraft did not have any proper business seating neither when I asked they had a simple blanket nor a pillow. Having arrived after a few unpleasant hours to Geneva I have learned my suitcases were untraceable, long story short after almost 3 days I still did not receive my suitcases and no one reached out to inform me about their status. Having perishable goods in former luggage and having to travel inside EU, it was certainly one of the worst experiences I had for travelling such a short distance. Worst part was neglecting of both airlines and Swisspost bag handling team, very unprofessional and unamicable.",0
Was flying home from a wedding and my original flight from London to Calgary was delayed by what was supposed to be 20 mins but ended up being 45 mins causing me to miss my connection in Calgary Alberta. They refused to help me with a hotel or even food vouchers for my overnight stay while waiting for my next flight! They were rude and not caring at all!,0
"I canceled my reservation to fly from JFK to Port of Spain in April 2022. I am still waiting for my refund. I have sent countless emails, and received countless replies, all insisting that I'll get a response within 48 hours. That's all I have received. In short, I can't see myself getting anything other than platitudes and lies from Caribbean. Massively disappointing, and obviously I would recommend that travellers avoid this outfit at all costs.",0
September 20 Vancouver to Puerto Vallarta flight 527. September 27 Puerto Vallarta to Vancouver flight 526. I will never fly Sunwing again. Seats are ridiculous with no leg room at all. The flight attendants were rude. Trip was 5 hours and by the time we got off we could hardly move because of being so cramped in those lousy seats.,0
"Hong Kong to Seoul Incheon. The staff was so nice and friendly I had to write this review. They brought me every little extra stuff like more orange juice and bread and butter and stayed super friendly. They literally wanted to help me which was a nice feeling. Everything else was good too, food as well.",1
"Flew from DC to Boston for the marathon this year. It was only an hour gate to gate, which was one of the shortest flights I've ever flown. They had seatback TVs, that played around 35 channels. The flight attendants weren't very interesting. Served soda and snacks, including peanuts, chips and cookies. Good service overall. Bumpy though, because there was a storm over Cape Cod. Very cheap, but overall it was a very good flight.",1
"Upon reaching the check in counter, I was asked to pay 6700 php for over buggage. They considered my laptop with charging brick as excess baggage. I previously came from Qatar to the Philippines with the same bag and they did not even weigh the bag after i told them it was my laptop. It was initially 9k php according to the lady a Filipina who was rude, and I dont know but the lady changed it to 6700php. Upon reaching the plane, there was no food unless you pay for it. The flight was more than 4 hours due to delays and many were really hungry on this flight. They did not even provide water. I will never use this airline again. Not worth it.",0
My partner and I were on our honeymoon and had booked to travel to Sal Boa Vista San Vincent and back to Sal over a 2 week period. Our first flight from Sal left 30 minutes early so we arrived at Boa Vista 2 hours early only to be told the flight had gone and they had no explanation why. They offered use flights the next day which included an extra flight and would have taken all day. We lost all confidence in the company as we had arranged hotels and a ferry to fit in with our flight so we just asked for the direct flight back to Sal which was days later and stayed there the rest of our holiday.,0
"Been waiting for something, anything from Airasia since they canceled my flight. What a joke around and around with absolutely no result no return contact, nothing. BIG Loyalty Program member for years? Nothing more than a farce. I've been a long time user of this airline, 24 flights alone in the past couple of years but never again.",0
Gatwick to Rome. Worst airline service ever. Staff rude and lying to me about flight being full. They would not not let me move to empty row of seats once the plane is fully boarded,0
The flight crew were so professional and respectful. I have flown for the last 10 years but that was the smoothest flight I've ever experienced. The pilots were just top notch. The descent was so smooth. Touch was even better. Kudos to them all.,1
"Charlotte, NC to Boston, MA with American Airlines. Terrible customer service. Cancelled flight and then booked me on another flight 46 hours later after I had already completed the first leg of my trip. My husband had the same issue 1 week earlier, so this is a recurring problem for them. Inability to rebook you on a convenient flight. If you call, you are directed to gate agents, which are not at the gate. Gate agents tell you to call the airline. No one else you solve the problem of the flight they cancelled.",0
"United left me and my husband stranded. Our flight was canceled due to a mystery weather advisory, the weather in Mobile was clear it never rained and it rained in Houston for two hours. We tried to rebook, there were no flights until the following Tuesday. That was not an option because me and my husband both had to be at work on Monday. I tried calling customer service. Starting at 10 pm, I waited on the phone for two hours. Never reached anyone. So we had to rent a car and drive 8 hours home. I paid for a round trip ticket, so I expected a round trip home. I will never fly United again. Hopefully I'm able to get a refund.",0
"I was beyond disappointed with Hawaiian Airlines. From the horrible customer service, rude flight attendants, planes that are so outdated and falling apart that nothing works on them. The terrible fees they charge. I left a carry on bag and when I tried to get a flight attendant from our flight to help me out with it I was met with a rude attitude and told I would just have to call the next day because she needed to meet her friend who was picking her up. When I asked if there was someone else she said there was no managers or staff or anyone in the entire airport that could help, I find that hard to believe considering the fact that our baggage hadn't even made it to baggage claim when I notified her that I left somthing behind. She made no effort to try to help at all and was clearly bothered by me even asking. The flight attendants on the plane weren't any friendlier either. When boarding the plane I was told my carry on wouldn't fit because this was a really old plane and the bins are small and hopefully my bags would make it cause that's reassuring. For the amount of money I spent to fly 7 people I would expect a lot more. I am doubtful I will get any help tomorrow regarding my carry on left behind. I have flown with many other airlines and never had such a poor experience.",0
EY16 Manchester to Abu Dhabi on 14th April. Business class. Arriving Abu Dhabi there was no gangway we had to disembark using metal steps. There was no handrail and I aged 87 I had difficulty using the steps with very little to help me to climb down. At the same time an elderly lady perhaps not as old as myself but using a walking stick also had difficulty going down to ground level. There ought to have been a handrail. Thursday 1st May on my return at Sydney airport I attempted to find the Business class lounge prior to boarding EY455 Sydney to Abu Dhabi. I walked almost the length to Gate 60 before I found that it was near the Duty Free section. I had waked past with a number of people. The signing was poor and needed an overhead indication. On 3rd May EY021 Abu Dhabi to Manchester I asked for grilled beefsteak from the main menu only to be informed that it was not available. The alternative from the Anytime Menu was adequate. At all times the staff were extremely efficient pleasant and helpful.,1
"I booked flights for myself and my wife in 6th Jan 2020 with Malindo Air to take us from India to Perth via Malaysia on 23 April 2020 but due to covid the flights were cancelled. I filled out the Refund request form straight away but it kept crashing, eventually after a week it went through. I hadn't heard anything back so I emailed customer services on 22nd April and heard nothing so I emailed again on 4th May and again 14th May and still had no reply. I then found they had a Facebook page so I messaged the page on 18th May and they replied to say they had passed the message onto the relevant department. Having heard nothing back I messaged them again on 31st May, they replied on 1st June and said my refund was being processed and I just needed to wait. I waited until 17th June and messaged again, this time they replied and said they were going to escalate it. Finally 23rd June they messaged back to say they were doing my refund via a voucher to be used on flights and valid for 12 months. I replied straight back and explained that I do not intend to fly in the next 12 month or even longer and that I wanted my money returned, not a voucher. They replied back and said no money will be refunded. As you can imagine with covid 19 I'm not in a hurry to go abroad and I need the money refunded as I'm currently unable to work.",0
Flight 929 from Trenton to Detroit yesterday. After hearing a number of bad comments I had very low expectations. They gave me an option of a food box which I liked. Had a small TV in front of my seat. Flight attendants were funny and very nice. Seats were comfortable.,1
"Goa to Mumbai. Worst flying experience ever. The flight was delayed by 2 hours, due to some operational problems. The staff was extremely unprofessional and rude. I paid for the meal beforehand but the flight host was not ready to give me my meal for no reason. Finally, he gave me a tasteless sandwich after asking multiple times. Even on my Mumbai to Goa flight, the staff was super rude. Either they are not trained at all or they are being underpaid, and hence they take out all the frustration on their passengers. Never flying again on Spicejet for sure.",0
Not a good experience flying first class from Seattle to Charlotte. On second leg there wasn't any first class on the plane and they didn't put my wife and myself together. Very frustrating. I did demand a refund and they did accommodate. Flying back from Charlotte they couldn't get my wife and Myself together in first class. Very frustrating. They didn't even try to fix that one. Customer service from United is questionable. They act like they just don't care.,0
My Business Class flight from RJK to LHR was business in name and cost only. Despite the online reservation system clearly indicating that the central seat on the A319 is left vacant consistent with my experience of other Star Alliance partners an upgraded passenger was put in the seat next to me and the response from the airline was only that they do not guarantee the extra space. This is an extremely misleading reservation system and doesn't help when your partner has booked the aisle seat thinking they are next to you. The only communication from the cabin crew regarding the move was to ask me whether I would mind moving to let him have the window seat! The airport had no business facilities there was no sparkling wine the food was extremely poor I was not even able to get a second piece of butter for my bread and my baggage with its priority tag was one of the last to arrive at LHR after a 45 minute wait. Considering the large price gap I am left wondering what exactly that money paid for as I am certain that a slice of ham and bowl of cereal cannot cost over 100 GBP themselves?,0
We flew from London to Mauritius and Mauritius to Perth. We had our 16 month old daughter with us and the staff were great. Food was ok seats comfy. The land staff even gave us 4 seats for 3 of us from Mauritius for more comfort.,1
"I used ANA last Nov. 2015, it was the best flight I ever had. From the plane with wide spacious leg room, the most tasteful meal, and the best service of Cabin Crew. It's a long flight but the crew still manage to smile and rendered a good service. From check in counter in San Jose, you can see how courteous and respectful staff they have and to the counter staff in Transfer Desk of Narita so polite and respective manner when you inquire or ask help. ANA is the best!",1
After a 4 hour flight from Manila to Inchon and a 6 hour layover I boarded the plane to see my window seat taken by a family with children. They pointed to the child and not wanting to be inconsiderate I took their middle seat in another aisle. I told the hostess I wished a window seat. She said she would get back to me after boarding. Even after I was served a special dietary meal and explained this isn't my seat and I was still waiting for a window I was never moved or given an explanation. Last time I use this airline.,0
San Francisco to Nashville. Horrible customer service! Booked this flight months ago and upgraded to exit row at extra fee. 3 hours before flight my seats were given away. My party was disbursed throughout plane. Rude attendants. I have extreme anxiety and other health issues and those were not considered.,0
"They lost my luggage on the first leg of my flight for the first 5 days of my vacation and I have to see if I get reimbursed for the new clothes I had to buy. And on my return flight, our flights from Toronto have been delayed and gates changed 7 times and some of the changes were over 30 gates away before changing them again less than 15 minutes later. Air Canada staff in the airports have been less than helpful, and in Toronto, staff was rude to passengers that were trying to make their connection flight due to their own delays.",0
Our flight from Bangkok to Dubai was on the newer A380 and was half empty in Business class. The seat is very comfortable and the crew provided us with a mattress to make it even better for sleeping. There is plenty of storage and the bar next to the seat is a nice touch. The main bar at the back of the upper floor is great idea for socializing. Flight from Dubai to LHR was on the older A380 and it was showing its age. The seat was not as nice and quite dirty in some parts. The crew were friendly and selection of drinks was great. I am vegetarian and I was struggling to find anything on the menu. I ended up having just a starter and dessert. They were both tasty but I am surprised that they did not offer any main meals without meat.,1
I have travelled with Air Canada in the past and did not hesitate to book a flight with Rouge thinking that it would be a similar experience. I was so wrong! I travelled from Toronto to Phoenix. While waiting at the gate the staff were so disorganized they were not able to board the passengers in a timely fashion. There were 5 boarding groups. They called the first second and third in rapid succession so there were very long lines that were taking very long time to process. Once on the plane there was not adequate space for my carry on. I was told I had to check it. Since I have medications in the bag that I cannot be without I refused to check the bag. The stewardess asked me to remove the medication from my bag and keep it in my purse or under my seat. It would have been embarrassing! In order to remedy this situation in the future perhaps Rouge should not allow people to place backpacks and smaller items that can fit under the seat in the overhead bins so more room would be available for carry on bags. Then place coats and jackets in the bins after the bags are in place. The plane was so full that I had to sit on my winter coat for the entire 4 hour flight as there was not even a space for my coat. Not too comfortable. I paid the same price or more than my last Air Canada flight Toronto to Phoenix so Rouge is not even offering a more economical flight. More than likely more profit for the airline less comfort for the passenger.,0
"Adelaide to Sydney. We request wheelchair assistance online before travelling and was confirmed via email by Qantas. We arrived at the airport and the staff told us there is no wheelchair available and assistance was not provided. After telling them I have booked and made a fuss, they gave us a wheelchair and we had to push my father with COPD all the way. Getting off at Sydney, the wheelchair was not prepared during our exit of the flight. I am very angry and disappointed. If I allowed my father to travel alone and trusted this service it would have negatively affected his health. I will not be flying with Qantas anymore after so long. If you need wheelchair assistance don't fly Qantas. If you have a family member who needs assistance don't book Qantas and don't trust them. I have filed a complaint to Qantas and the reply was please accept their apology. If anything happened due to their failure to provide such essential service, is an apology enough?",0
"The worst customer service I have ever experienced. I have been given the run around trying to get a ticket refund from a flight that was cancelled due to unforeseen technical difficulties. I am absolutely speechless how bad it is, I don't even know where to start.",0
"What an unpleasant experience. I traveled with Luxair on the 14th of July and till today 30th of October, I have never received my luggage or received any compensation. I think I have been so patient and you guys don't seem to care. This is very careless. It was my first time traveling with this airline and the last time. U",0
Oakland to Vancouver. Renee at Oakland airport service desk was amazing. She assisted me with a flight change to leave earlier than my scheduled departure. She also provided a complimentary drink ticket which I didn't realize! I really appreciate your assistance and wanted to thank you. Keep up the good work and thank you for everything you do.,1
"Flight from Bogota to Paris in the new Boeing 787 was nice and comfortable even in economy class. The service in Air France is outstanding. flight attendants are very receptive and show a good and educated way to help the people at the airplane. I liked very much the way Air France is doing things lately, its no doubt a great improvement on the service this company is bringing.",1
"Los Angeles to Mexico. Never travel with Interjet. I missed a wedding because of their delays.  First they told me there was a twenty minutes delay. Then it went to two hours. Trust me, look for alternatives.",0
"Flew Air India from Bhubaneswar to New Delhi. The only bad thing was the delayed flight. All the rest was excellent. Seats were good, food and staff service was good. Clean Lounge. Enough food was given. I requested hot water and that was fulfilled by staff.",1
"Singapore to London. They wanted to charge me an extra GBP65 for being over the 23kg limit. The legroom seemed very small to me, the flight was super full and I was sitting next to a big woman who spilled over her side of the seat. I was asked if I would like tea or coffee with my breakfast and the steward said he will come back with the tea. After a long time I managed to catch the same guy walking by and asked him for my tea and he just said that there was no tea.",0
Copenhagen to Bucharest with Blue Air. Everything was perfect. The flight took off earlier than scheduled. Everything went smoothly and extremely efficient. The plane was in good condition and clean.,1
"Manchester to Faro. Was rather apprehensive as I had never heard of Small Planet Airlines, but no reason to worry. The ground staff at Manchester were pleasant and helpful, the aircraft was modern and clean and the cabin crew very efficient and friendly. Flight left on time and arrived 10 minutes early. Well done Small Planet. Would not hesitate to use them again.",1
My much anticipated first flight on the Dreamliner turned out to be a bit of a disaster. My wife and I flew from Melbourne to Bangkok in economy. The entertainment system which we had pre booked did not work for either of us the screen had completely frozen and despite the best efforts of the crew to restart it numerous times it just would not go. Amazingly for such a new plane we were not the only one on the flight with this problem. The way JetStar have designed their entertainment unit is if it's unresponsive like ours were not only do you not get video but you cannot turn on the overhead light or call an attendant. It's all integrated in with each other. Due to the Dreamliner windows automatically shading out while mid flight we had to sit there in the dark with no entertainment or reading. Let me tell you it was a long 8 hour flight. I only picked JetStar for the Dreamliner experience. Never again.,0
"Condor Airlines has no concept of safety, appearance or hospitality. The stewardesses look drab, hair was a mess and not off the neck. They spoke in German without even bothering to ask if we were English. Upon departure and arrival, no safety checks were completed to ensure all bags were safely stowed under the seat or in the overhead bins. A woman sitting beside my husband in the 2nd row, had a huge straw basket on her lap the entire journey. When the stewardess went by to check for safety belts, she made no attempt to ask the passenger to stow her bag. ",0
"Richmond to Chicago. I felt so pleased with United Airlines and its people. We got to Chicago 19 minutes early, and so far there hasn't been any turbulence during the flight. I enjoy having a personal screen with DirecTV right in front of me.",1
"The plane had a foul odor throughout the flight. The plane sat on the tarmac for nearly an hour before going anywhere. The food was hardly edible, though not necessary for the short 2 hour flight. Lukewarm beer was served free of charge. The plane itself was old and in need of retirement. The seats were about as cramped together as any I have seen.",0
"If you are in trouble, you can count on American Airlines. I lost my passport before my flight from Las Vegas to Toronto and you should see all they did for me. More than I could ask. They found me a solution, reorganize everything and didn't charge a cent for it. All the staff were great.",1
London Heathrow to Perth via Dubai with Emirates. As a nervous flyer the cabin crew were aware of it and they couldn't have been more attentive and considerate. This was based on the fact that the flight was quite empty so he said he had more time to spend with me. The food was amazing and the inflight entertainment is exceptional. On the way back it was a Qantas flight and their flight staff couldn't give a monkeys that I was terrified. As far as I'm concerned Emirates are outstanding compared to Qantas.,1
"This airline decided to cancel our tickets to Las Vegas and they did not offer an explanation as to why. When I tried to contact them via phone, I had to sit on hold for hours. When trying to chat with them, they never had an available agent. This airline is a joke. They will never get my business, no matter how cheap they are, and you all should do the same. Worst airline experience by far and I do a lot of flying.",0
"Riga to Oslo. Terrible service! All passengers checked and charged 60 euro for overweight, even if only 1kg, jackets, pocket contents and the book in your hand included. Passengers that took their clothes on accused by the company representative for being childish. If checking in less than one hour before departure you get charged 35 extra euros.",0
San Diego to Charlotte via Orlando. The first flight got cancelled and the second one was delayed with the time being moved later and later. I will not be flying with Frontier Airlines again. They did not compensate for my travel plans being disrupted and the additional costs incurred.,0
"Since July of 2021, this airline has either delayed or canceled every flight my family has taken. Being from Miami Florida there are not many other options for departing flights. I really cannot believe that management of this company has yet to solve its on time issues after 5 months. I will now be driving to the Ft Lauderdale airport for other options for departures from the South Florida.",0
I flew from Cochi to Delhi with my wife. I felt like I walked into a shop not a plane. The crew did not even offer water instead focused on selling stuff. One of the crew was so rude. I am never going to fly with Spicejet again.,0
Upgraded to business class for the flight from Hong Kong to Shanghai. Bulkhead seat at the front so masses of legroom. Seats very comfortable. It seems almost unfair to offer any negative comments on the flight but I picked the wrong entree! I chose halibut but it didn't come with the sauce the menu said I'm still not sure what it was! My partner chose a pork dish which was extremely tasty. Drinks offered before take off before meal and wine served with the meal. Good entertainment selection. Very pleasant experience. Attentive and professional flight attendants.,1
"Impossible to claim the refund for expenses due to the cancellation of my flight. They sent me an email recalling my right to obtain refund upon presentation of receipts relating to meals, accommodation, transportation etc.. After spending a very long time trying to find the right section on their website and calling their customer support, I haven't managed to get someone from the support. I only get a robot chat or a robot voice with no answer for my request. It's clear all is made so that it's impossible for me to claim back those refunds.",0
"Our flight had to make an emergency landing due to an unwell passenger which was understandable however what happened next made me never want to fly with Lufthansa again. Pilot said we could either rebook onto another flight or stay in a hotel while another flight is arranged for us. Upon departing the plane we were approached by a member of staff of Ankara airport who had no ties to Lufthansa. She provided a phone number to get in contact with Lufthansa should we want to rearrange a flight, this number did not work. After calling multiple Lufthansa numbers we were told different lies on every attempt as to why they couldn't rebook us onto a flight leaving in 2 hours. The best one was that our baggage hadn't been released by the airport when we in fact had the baggage in our hands. On 2 occasions the member of staff  we were speaking to just stopped replying to any questions or queries and seemed to have hung up. This all resulted in a substantial phone bill and a missed days work. After contacting them to offer the opportunity to reimburse the said phone bill as a good will gesture and reinvest some faith in this airline I was accused of demanding compensation.",0
Thomas Cook do not care about customers. Outbound flight was the worst. The cabin crew were only interested in selling duty free goods. Choice of food was very limited and what I did buy was smashed to bits. No leg room at all and seats so close together there was no room to move at all. The safety announcements were announced in a very unprofessional way as if they were bored stiff of saying the same thing to their customers and spoken so fast! On arriving at holiday airport it was announced that we had landed at East Midlands Airport! On return journey we had to queue for 2 hours to check in giving us no time to look around duty free. There was no apology. People were tired and irritable especially those with young children. Wont use Thomas Cook ever again.,0
"Hong Kong to London Heathrow via Bangkok. Flying experience was exceptional. The first flight from Hong Kong to Bangkok was delayed for one hour due to the thunderstorm in Hong Kong. This shrunk my transfer time by one hour. However, ground staff at Bangkok airport friendly helped us and the connection was finally smooth. From Hong Kong to Bangkok I flewed on an old B747 but entertainment system was updated. Cabin crew was enthusiastic and hot towel was provided when boarding. From Bangkok to London I flewed on A380. Although legroom was tighter than that on B747, it provides more seat recline and I found it comfortable as well as a 190cm. Food was among the best, especially compared with airlines in China. Each meal consisted of hot food, dessert and salad. Freshly baked croissant was provided at breakfast. I will definitely fly with Thai again.",1
"We upgraded to Business Class on the way to Lisbon and had a very pleasant experience. However, any satisfaction that we may have had with TAP quickly evaporated upon our return trip. Upon check in we were told we needed to pay for baggage, as our tickets did not include checked luggage. I attempted to show the agent my ticket on my phone indicating that the tickets included 1 x 23 KG checked bag per passenger and was rudely informed to put my phone away, she was not interested in looking at that. I asked for a manager and was told to go to the Customer Service kiosk. After waiting 45 minutes to be seen there, a similarly rude individual told me that the system showed that our tickets did not include baggage. Once again, attempts to show them my tickets and baggage allowance on my phone were declined and I was told that the system was the correct source for baggage information, regardless of what my ticket showed. I asked if the agent did not have the ability to overwrite the charge, given the proof I had, and was told no, the system could not do overwrites as it was always correct. I asked for another manager and was told to submit a complaint when we returned home. And to make matters worse, the actual charge for the baggage was 95 Euros per bag for the fee plus a 95 Euro penalty for not paying for baggage in advance, even though our tickets clearly indicated that a 23 KG bag per person was included. I completed the Complaint form when I returned requesting a reimbursement and have heard nothing. I emailed the VP of Customer Service for TAP one week ago and once again, have heard nothing. Beyond frustrated with this experience!",0
"London to Helsinki. A350 with great Business class cabin, this flight we sat in the second cabin as we wanted to have overhead luggage bins, The forward cabin only has bins at the side. Easy and efficient service for a short haul flight. Usual lie flat seat and large screen, Food very good.",1
"Frankfurt to Newark. The flight is not possible due to Corona travel restrictions. Instead of refunding the tickets United is offering flight credits with ridiculous restrictions. This is completely unacceptable. Moving the flight is currently impossible with the uncertainty of the Coronavirus outbreak, United flight credit restricted to use in the next 12 months is equally useless. Terrible customer service, lacklustre communication. All around an upsetting experience.",0
Barcelona to Gatwick. After losing my luggage and then finding it and delivering it days later they refuse to compensate me for any money I spent on clothes and necessities until my bag was delivered. I sent Vueling all required documents to properly file for compensation over 2.5 weeks ago. Now Vueling states that my luggage was returned within their 24 window in which no compensation issued.,0
"Qantas canceled the flights. They provided only one alternative option requiring a visa. When I pointed it out, they charged an extra 820AUD to have a rescheduled flight without a visa requirement. But they lost my other tickets. I was trying to persuade them for two hours until I got my tickets back. But these flights were canceled again. You can't speak with someone in Melbourne airport. They say to call the hotline and wait for an hour until a rude operator will refuse to solve your issue",0
My girlfriend and I changed our booking prior to our flight and we have a reciept saying we should get 100 euros refund as a result of us changing the booking. We have waited 5 months so far and have not received a cent. We have contacted air Canada several times to ask where the money is at. The first time we were told it would arrive shortly. The second time we were thrown around between different people until we got hung up on out of nothing. The third time today I called in and asked where the money was at and now they say my name isn't even the one on the ticket and booking reference I've made. They refuse to receive my boarding pass and receipts which state that the ticket is of course mine. As to the actual experience flying with Air Canada I do not have anything positive to say. Our food was extremely small portions and very bland. I would not recommend buying anything through Air Canada if you can avoid to do so.,0
Milan to Moscow. Ridiculous cabin baggage policy. Bad service and having to pay extra fees. Service very poor.  It looks like bonus of employees is linked to give you any penalties.,0
Los Angeles to Auckland Business class. Air NZ have a great business class product very comfortable seats and staff lay out the bed with a mattress topper. Good IFE and food pretty good. Best thing was the staff so friendly and seem to really enjoy their job compared to all the other airlines we use over the years. Nothing is too much trouble for them.,1
Denpasar Bali to Adelaide on Monday May 27. I would just like to thank all the staff that were on that flight.  These ladies obviously all love their work and are passionate about the service the provide. They were very accomodating and attentive and after leaving such a beautiful holiday it was so nice to be greeted with a genuine smile and warmth.  Thankyou for making it such a pleasurable flight.,1
"We were unable to check in online. We phoned regarding this and after being hung up on twice by rude staff we were told it would be sorted at the airport which it was. However, on the way back we were told the flight had been overbooked, we were on standby but this would be resolved at the gate. It was not. We tried to talk to various members of staff but they either did not speak enough English or shouted at us. We were given a voucher for a 'meal' which got us one slice of pizza and were left to navigate Istanbul Airport by ourselves. We eventually found the place to collect our luggage but were told it was too much work for them to locate it. After insisting, we eventually got our suitcases back and transit to the worst hotel. We  got a flight home one day late. We were told we would get 400 euros compensation but that did not happen today because there are no Turkish Airlines staff at Edinburgh Airport so we are still chasing this.",0
"I will never fly with EasyJet again. In my last trip in the peak of the COVID pandemic in 2020, I had a terrible experience with them with very few measures taken for the virus and I promised to never fly with them again, but this year I decided to unfortunately give them a chance again. The main reason of my complaint now is this appalling, cheap and relentless baggage policy they have. Not being able to bring an overhead cabin luggage without paying extra for it is disgusting. It serves no purpose besides scamming your customers and making the check in less efficient, since a lot of unaware people have to pay 29 euros before boarding to get in the plane, and the suitcase goes to the hold and not even with you on board. The staff in Palma de Mallorca told me I could have paid to choose a seat and get the suitcase, but a lot of passangers had to do it on spot.",0
30 Oct 14 GA727 Perth to Denpasar. On time. Attentive cabin crew. Good food. Good inflight entertainment. Love the seats. We travel at least twice a year.,1
"I bought 4 tickets from Eindhoven to Sofia return. I traveled with my daughter and I paid full amount ticket and paid extra cost 2 seaters, Wizz priority and I paid also extra Wizz club because mentioned in the website if I bought then give me special price every time I fly with Wizz Air. I brought 1 cabin baggage and 1 small school bag which inside there were kid lunch box and child cloth. The incident began while I arrived at Eindhoven Airport where staff said that I should pay extra cost for the baggage, I asked her why because I paid 2 full amount ticket, I paid for 2 seaters, I paid for priority passenger and even I paid extra for Wizz Club Card. I argued with her but she denied me to board if I did not pay 25 euro extra. I did not have any option beside to paid 25 euro extra otherwise again they wont let me on the board.  While I fly back on 10 October 2019 from Sofia to Eindhoven I did not have some problem even I brought exactly same back as I left before from Eindhoven. After arrived In Nederland, I submitted complain via Wizz Air Website,I took so long to got reaction of my complain as they said must investigate the case.  After took so long, they said that I broke the rule term and baggage condition that why extra fee applied but how come I broke the rule?",0
"Have a flight canceled from Myanmar to Bangladesh, due to not enough people in the flight. No refund. Next flight available in 3 days. End up buying a flight from different airline. Then flight from Dhaka to Kuala Lumpur, delayed for 6 hours. Worst customer service in the airport. Worse aircrew. Avoid.",0
We had flights from Bangkok to HCMC and from HCMC to the Gold Coast via KL. All flights left and arrived on time which was excellent. We paid for hot seats for extra legroom on the trip to the Gold Coast but being tall was still cramped for room in the first row behind premium. Will be flying again with Air Asia in February.,1
"Worst company rescheduling the flight without asking, and now not even returning the money. They are really a worst airline company. Never understand the feelings of the person what they are going through.",0
"We booked our honeymoon to Cancun flying with Spirit and this was the worst thing we could of done. We got there 2 hours early and there was already a huge line. 30 minutes before we were suppose to take off they canceled our flight because the crew did not show up. Not sure what the real problem was, but we were given the option to wait to find other flights or get a full refund. Due to the lack of information we decided to cancel our trip. If there was an option to give them a zero I would. Avoid.",0
Istanbul to Athens. 1.5 hour delay is unacceptable. It was my second flight delay with Aegean in just one week. Seat space and meal very poor.,0
"Mexico City to Tijuana. I was singled out and told to comply, never given a real reason other than my carry on wouldn't fit in the plane compartment and that it needed to be checked. I measured my bag and it fit just fine, like it had on so many past flights. So I refused to check it. When I raised my voice I was reprimanded by an aggressive and intimidating male employee who told me that I should not speak to a woman that way. I was singled out of a long line of people who had not yet boarded. I was told that there was not enough room on board for my carry on. A lie. There were at least 23 vacant seats as well once I boarded with my luggage that I refused to check. I had a laptop and some delicate art unframed that I had purchased in Ecuador that I had no intentions of checking with baggage.",0
Overall very disappointed with Etihad service. The seats were uncomfortable food choice was not good considering 14 hour flight to Toronto. I found the crew arrogant and unprofessional. Etihad has stopped including wet tissue in meal tray a very cheap move by them.,0
"Munich to Tokyo via Doha. This is the first time I write a review on an airline, but I have to. I have been flying a fair bit over the years and I haven't had a service like that before. Qatar Airways staff is extremely friendly and helpful. They are helpful with the food, explaining well what they have on offer. They are happy to prepare you a drink that cannot just be poured out of a bottle, like my gin and tonic yesterday.  They keep coming with water and juice throughout the flight every 30 minutes or so. I have never seen this on a long flight before. They are still friendly and heap it up for you.  Even more surprising is the state of the toilets. I'd almost feel sorry for the crew if I hadn't paid a fair amount of money for my flight. They are still clean one or two hours before landing. Thank you for this great experience.",1
This service is awful. The airline overbooks and sells your seat if you dont pay for it. We stood in line for 3 hours just to be told that we did not check in on time. And still we were an hour early. They said there were no seats available. Then we get to the counter where only 2 agents are working and we stand for 10 minutes waiting while the girl is on her cell phone.,0
I flew 1st class to MN from Phoenix AZ on 17th April. I thought due to the upcoming holiday that it might be might be hard for the stewardess to take care of all our needs. One lady in particular was wonderful during the flight. The flight was fast. I was given access to movies music games etc. My family was very impressed with this airline and its staff.,1
"Doha to Perth. After just arriving from London, the plane was late which meant a very quick turnover for the start of what I thought would be a gruelling 11hr flight to Perth only to be made more so pleasant by the kindness and professional services of a cabin staff. The plane was full and people were understandably restless, including myself. Staff remained calm, professional and helpful throughout the long duration of the flight which put my mind at ease knowing i was in good hands.",1
The last three times I booked a flight with Frontier the flight was cancelled. Today my wife and I learned of our flight for this Thursday was canceled. How am I supposed to reschedule a flight on just three days notice? It will cost a fortune. This airline is the most unreliable airline I have ever seen in my life. Their additional charges are ridiculous. I will never fly this airline again.,0
"Horrible experience they lost my bag which resulted in my 2 small boys and I missing my flight. My boys did not eat for 6 hours because of this and never was offered food. They did offer to comp my meal on an Air Canada flight I eventually was moved to, this came to 26 dollars which is not sufficient for the trouble we were put through it was like they didn't care at all. I will never fly with them again.",0
"Very rude ground staff, unprofessional arrogant and have no customer service. We have had the worst experience with the Turkish Airlines ground staff after a lovely holiday. Will never fly with them again, please stay away!",0
"Great experience. A350 clean and in good condition, welcome was friendly and tentative even cabin was full. Departure on time, captain welcomed us and explains the route till the destination. IFE was OK, limited to my taste of movies. I managed to find 2 movies to keep me busy. In Flight Service was exceptional, I had ordered Western menu. Everything was perfect and tasty. Obstacle they do not offer pajamas. You can have WiFi connection but you have to pay even if you are in Business Class.",1
Flew Swiss from Tel Aviv to London via Zurich. Wonderful airline. The seats were very comfortable. The service was very good. All flights were on time. Sure I will fly with them again. The entertaiment system is full and updated. The aircraft was one of the cleanest I have flown.,1
"Changzhou to Adelaide via Guangzhou. The overall journey is fine, but the service at Changzhou airport needs to be improved. I checked in my two luggages which are supposed to be collected at the destination airport, Adelaide. However, When I was transferring at Guangzhou Airport, I was notified my luggage were not checked in to Adelaide. The ground services assisted me to solve the problem so that I can successfully be on the flight to Adelaide.",1
"Before I thought this is good airline, not anymore. During covid i have flown every month with it, sometimes business and sometimes economy. In economy they do not serve any alcohol but in business they do.",0
"Phoenix to Reykjavik via Dallas Ft Worth. Great experience with this airline traveling to Iceland and return. No issues whatsoever. Lounges in Dallas were great, especially at D terminal, in which it is new.",1
Melbourne to Hobart. Fast check in flight left on time the only bad thing the departure lounge in Melbourne. For the price I paid who cares.,1
"This was my first time flying Jetblue Airways. I have been flying many others such as United, Delta etc but I have to say that my experience with Jetblue was so much better than other domestic airlines. Their seats were much more comfortable, leg space in economy class more than in another airlines. I wasnt forced to check my carry on luggage as I usually am with United. Flight departed and arrived on time. In plane they have much wider choice of snacks plus you can ask for as many packages as you wish, same with sodas. All seats had small screens and I was able to watch TV channels for free. They had about 37 complimentary channels, basic news channels, comedy etc. The reason why i chose to try this airline was beacuse they had the lowest price for my selected travel dates and after this great experience I would fly with them again.",1
"We had a round flight from McAllen to Orlando. Our returning flight was delayed at first and then completely canceled. We were already inside the plane when we were informed. I tried chatting with customer service, they said they couldn't so much and disconnected the chat. I've tried calling but was placed on hold for almost 4 hours and I gave up. I've called back multiple times but Allegiants line sounds busy and disconnects. I've emailed them with no response. The people at the ticket counter could only help with certain questions. We were rebooted for Monday March 21, 2022. We were supposed to leave Friday March 18th 2022 originally. They are not making themselves responsible for hotel or transportation, or anything else due to the canceled flight. It was my first time flying with them and it will be the last. Horrible way to treat customers. Some people didn't find a returning flight till a week later. It is terrible. We are losing time from our jobs, missed appointments, etc. We understand issues happen. But they should be considerate and cover hotel and transportation costs at the very least.",0
"Once again very pleasant experience flying with Westjet. Ground staff and flight staff kind and helpful. Flight from Winnipeg to Toronto was delayed for an hour and passengers were informed of the delay at all times. Clean aircraft, generous legroom and comfortable seats. ",1
"Flew American Airlines from New Delhi to Baltimore via Atlanta. Staff are rude. Food below expectation. Seat selection Nil. Utterly bad experience. Rudely asked at Atlanta if I was really seated in a Business class seat by airline staff. They had chosen me the Hindu meal without my consent. No choice, no change, so had to consume what was thrown at me.",0
Dallas Ft Worth to Ontario. Esther is amazing. A co worker and I missed our flight to LAX. She was working the check in station at another flight going to Ontario. She went above and beyond to help us make it on a flight so we can get home tonight and see our family. She is the embodiment of customer service and care. I will remember her and American Airlines for helping us out in our time of need!,1
SFO to JFk and back. The staff friendly professional and efficient. The whole process from purchasing tickets to online boarding passes simple food ordering on board was excellent and easy. I was most impressed that the cabin staff was constantly walking through the cabin to relieve passengers of any refuse so the cabin remained clean and there was no juggling of used cups food containers etc. My only difficulty is that while slightly more roomy than some other airlines the leg room is still uncomfortable for anyone with long legs.,1
"Barcelona to Gatwick. I've started flying easyJet for business in favor of BA because of punctuality issues with latter. I've flown with them 5 times in last year for both biz and family and all flights have been on time or ahead of time. On this occasion we arrived 40 mins early which was useful to get me to a meeting I thought I wouldn't make. I paid for Easyjet Plus so I could take extra bag, speedy boarding and select exit aisle. I had the entire row to myself. It was an uneventful, comfortable flight, just as it should be for less than 2 hours.",1
Orlando to Philadelphia. I was worried with all the not so good reviews. Staff was nice. Plane left and landed on time. Got exactly what I paid for. Have no complaints. I would definitely fly again.,1
"Writing this review after almost 10 attempts to fly with GoFirst and the flight has been cancelled at every single instance. This is the worst airline.  They have an extremely unethical business practice of showing flights on online portals that you book and then cancelling them. Apparently, they do not deem it fit to inform you in advance that the flight is cancelled and you have to continuously check it on their portal to learn for yourself that the flight is cancelled.",0
"Lulea to Trondheim via Stockholm. Super all praise to the crew and pilots is felt when flying or landing quiet flights super everything. The cabin crew kindly lose their luggage and deliver the same day to a hotel in Trondheim. All praise for speed and service. Super sve pohvale posadi i pilotimane osjeti se kada poljece ni kada sljece mirni letovi super sve. Kabinsko osoblje ljubazno, izgublje a prtljaga isti dan dostavlje a u hotel u Trondheim. Sve pohvale na brzini i usluzi.",1
Frankfurt to Mumbai in First class. Extremely caring team of individuals and very personable. The meals were delicious and well presented. Whoever does the airline catering for this sector is doing a very good job. My career is in Hotels hence I tend to focus naturally on food and service and have to admit both were exceptional. The upkeep of the facilities were very good. The amenities provided were better than many other airlines I have experienced in the past. I generally don't make time for reviews but this was something I had to do this time round. Thank you for the experience.,1
"Dallas to Columbus. Would not recommend. Pay up and get a reliable trip booked through another airline. Even though open seats are open on other flights they will under no circumstances change your flight without getting another full charge. Also, very well known for delays and better at making excuses for those delays than addressing them. Do yourself a favor and book through a more credible airline.",0
I really like bmi Regional. On an hour long flight from Brno to Munich they offer free drinks and a tasty sandwich. The flight attendant was very pleasant and the seats are very comfortable with generous leg room that you wouldn't expect on such a small aircraft. On time departure and arrival. I would've appreciated more information about the route but other than that it was a great experience and I would travel with bmi Regional anytime. As we were travelling with a child the flight attendant even gave us extra pretzels.,1
"Chennai to Singapore with IndiGo. Very nice seat, staff are very kind and smile faces. Pilots done very good job during lightning and turbulence inflight. Flight timings very perfect. Crew are very aware when passengers not wear seat belt during take off and alight.",1
The customer service at the airport is nothing to write home about. The policy seems like a punishment for those who chose to fly with them. Mistakes of any kind are fined heavily and the staff are rude if you ask for the simplest explanation. ,0
"San Francisco to Paris. Very pleasant flight, the food was great, restrooms clean, very comfortable. The crew was polite and they wanted to serve us any time we asked. Flight was on time",1
"Appalling service on Etihad business class. Didn't bother reading reviews as it supposedly is such a well renowned airline I didn't see it as necessary, but boy were we wrong. Seats broken, maitre flirting with passenger for hours and showing pictures of her in bathing suit, absolutely unbelievable. On our return flight we had 7 kids running back and forth from economy to business for 5 continuous hours, and cabin crew did nothing. At the end the business class was full of trash on the floor. Out of 4 flights only one was decent in flight as it was during night, and minimal service is needed, but they forgot to do priority boarding for business class in Abu Dhabi. On all 4 flights no priority baggage service. Disaster, and never again!",0
"I had the absolute worst flight experience of my life. My first flight took 2 hours to leave the ground, once I got off the flight I was notified that my connecting flight to get to Albany was delayed 12 hours because the crew never showed up. The service was horrendous and I did not even receive an apology from workers. I got a hotel voucher which was a run down disgusting hotel and was given a food voucher for ""dinner"", which was 12 dollars, I ended up rebooking my flight with a different airline because the same flight that was delayed 12 hours, was not even guaranteed to leave during the announced delay time. If I had waited I would have been stuck in Charlotte on Thanksgiving day when I had very limited time to see my family. The flight back was even worse. My first flight also almost took two hours to leave the ground so by the time I got off my first flight my next flight was boarding. I had to run from terminal F to terminal B, and made it there 17 minutes before the flight left and I was rudely shooed away and told that the doors were closed even though the flight was still there. There were many people on my connecting flight that were also shooed away. I was sobbing my eyes out from the stress, I needed to get back to my car which would have been towed if I did not make it back on time. I received no apologies, no accommodations. When I went to talk to someone about this issue they were extremely rude and quickly rebooked me a new flight and told me ""you better run if you want to make it on time"" after I ran 20 minutes to try to make my first connecting flight. I received no apologues, workers were disturbingly rude. Service was horrendous. I received no refund or vouchers after this hellish experience, where I have had other airlines send refunds and vouchers without me asking. I will be telling everyone about this horrible experience and I will never fly American airlines again. Truly the worst experience.",0
"My worst experience with any airline by far. Of the 4 flights on my round trip all 4 were delayed, and my luggage was lost both ways. On arrival at Frankfurt there was no personnel to disembark us so we were stuck for a half hour on the plane which almost made us miss our connecting flight. The first return flight was late, of course, so we had to sprint in Frankfurt airport not to miss our connecting flight. I arrived on Friday evening, it is now Sunday and my luggage still hasn't been delivered, so not only was my trip an absolute mess but I've had to spend my weekend at home waiting for my luggage. Any information pertaining to the delivery I've had to go fishing for myself calling any number I could find, and the least I can say is that they were hardly helpful at all. I won't be flying with Lufthansa again if I can help it, they seem to be in control of nothing which is not reassuring at all.",0
"Flew Paris CDG to Vancouver. Amazing experience, food was delicious, I did choose the risotto with mushrooms and I must say it was the best food I ever had served during a flight. They also served ice cream and water in the middle of the flight and another smaller meal before landing in Vancouver. Cabin crews were very friendly and attentive. The cabin was looking new and clean. Totally recommend flying with Air France, best European airline.",1
Brisbane to Kuala Lumpur via Brunei. Boeing 777 to Brunei clean efficient service Economy seat good pitch friendly staff tasty lunch. Average entertainment but it sufficed. A320 to Kuala Lumpur only a 2 hour flight but nice dinner again but more cramped on this plane. Price is the winner here nearly half of other airlines.,1
"Perth to Phuket via Singapore. We were traveling as a family of 3. Wife, kid and myself. The kid was a minor so she didn't have a seat allocated. But Wife and my seats were allocated on different rows. Asked the crew onboard and they were helpful, though the flight was full she asked the couple seating on a windows seat which has 3 seats if they could go in business class which they agreed to and then she relocated us to the 3 seats. That was excellent for the staff to look after us, and also she kept checking with us if all was fine. Excellent Customer Service.",1
"Planned overlay at JFK 2.5 hrs, actual overlay 7.5 hrs. By the time I arrived home, JetBlue had sent a very gracious apology email thanking all the passengers, stating we would each receive a credit since our experience had not met our expectations of the service we anticipated and thanking us for our patience.",1
"Bhubaneswar to Bangalore. I had done a ticket for my brother, flight time was 10pm. We reached airport at 9.20 and they denied to take the luggage as it was too late and no more check in baggages are allowed. They charged 3K for a small bag and they said if you don't wish to pay,  you can leave and come next time. And we don't have any other option rather to pay the money.",0
"Portland  to Boston. I am a mosaic member of jetblue because I have to fly a ton of mile for work and i often have to use them on the east coast. The issue I have with them is their lack of customer service at the airports they support. Today I am in Portland Oregon and I made the mistake of showing up 3 hours early for a flight. Yes, that's early, but I just want to check my bags, eat something and get home to Boston MA and I am taking the red eye at 900. Turns out that they do not man their counters here at the airport until the last minute and there is nothing I can do with my bags to get through to a decent place to eat. Mosaic customer service got confused and after explaining to them where I was repeatedly, they told me there is nothing they could do. So here I am, stuck with my bags until they decide to show up and let me check them. My tickets nor their website indicate that they have a time gate for baggage and so there is no way to know except to show up.",0
"Poor service, value money, do not keep time, charges less in order to change more on the luggage. I can never recommend Flair to someone.",0
"The service, food and overall flight was fantastic. I congratulate the airline a wonderful experience flying with you, I will definitely recommend Swiss.",1
London to Amritsar via Ashgabat with Turkmenistan Airlines. Disappointed with the staff and the service both ways of the route and the staff seemed disorganised of what they were doing. We were delayed by 4 hours and we sat in the plane without the staff giving any snacks or water. The seat quality was also bad. The size of food portion  was a lot. There is no entertainment on the plane and there are no tv's at the back of the seats.,0
"I flew to Paris with my boyfriend and I didn't have my luggage when I arrived in France. I had to rebuy some stuff I needed and started to wear my boyfriend's clothes! On our way back last Saturday, my boyfriend didn't get his luggage. It has been 3 days now and we don't even have the option to speak with someone. Customers service is pretty much no existent. We have been missing our luggage 2 times in 1 trip! This is unacceptable. I will never fly with them ever.",0
I recently travelled from Dublin to Tel Aviv via Copenhagen with SAS. The fares were very reasonable 5 of us round trip just under 3000 euros. However I can honestly say I will avoid travelling with SAS again. Aeroplanes so basic. Hard uncomfortable chairs. Only free coffee or tea on a night flight which was over four hours from Copenhagen to Tel Aviv. There was a problem and we were stuck 3 hours on the runway before we flew. We weren't offered a cold drink even. So seven hours later I was delighted to get off this plane. We bought a salad for 4 people which cost up to 60 euro and none of us ate it. It was disgusting. The flight attendants seemed miserable and couldn't wait to get off the plane. A horrible experience. Not even a soft pillow for the flight. I know I'm right as I compared it to my return trip via Turkish Airlines. Now they know how to treat their customers. Beautiful plane. Friendly staff. A meal on flight with drinks. Soft warm seats with pillows. TV screens with wide range of entertainment. Transfer staff available. Up Turkish airways. Never again SAS.,0
"Worst customer service. I requested a refund for canceled tickets and i told them that the original account is closed. They said get us a paper that its closed so we can transfer to a new one, i did and then they transfered to the closed account anyways. They then asked for another paper and when i got it, they said we cant help we already transfered the money. First of all, no money has reached the closed account and now they want to do the same thing to me with another canceled flight. They have literally been the worst customer service i ever dealt with. I recommend everyone stay away from Transavia because they don't care about your money, they will rob you and then reply to your emails by ignoring you and ignoring everything you were talking about.",0
"From outrageous confusing baggage fees to fees to ""go green"" to fees to run on the plane before others. The travel insurance is added in automatically without the ability to decline it. The website doesn't work half the time. The employees at the call center give you incorrect answers. I'm all for no frills, but this company got it wrong. I will not use this airline again.",0
"Excellent flight from Rome to New York on Delta Air Lines. Check in at Rome was fast and efficient. The Business Class seat was extremely comfortable. The cabin staff and service was excellent, friendly and polite. The IFE had several choices between music, movies, ant TV. The inflight meals and beverages were outstanding with ample choices. This was an excellent experience with Delta and I will be happy to fly with them again in the future.",1
"Ho Chi Minh City to Singapore. Absolutely the same horrible experience. My bags were weighed at the check in counter and no issues were found. At the gate I was asked to weigh my bags again. Together the bags were overweight, which they wanted me to pay 45 usd for and 21 usd for each kilo above certain number. They did not give the option to pay with card or even to go to an atm as atm is outside of airport. I didnt have cash and they didnt allow me to enter the plane and i missed my flight. This is the worth ever airline and experience i had. Dont take such flights.",0
"This is kind of a local bus service, which is flying. Changing the time of departure as per their needs and convenience. Just like a local bus service, we will not fly until all the seats are occupied. Third class service. Regretting my own decision by choosing Go First for my upcoming trip.",0
"Full afternoon flight. Ready to fly on time. Arrived early. Uneventful flight. Good service. Pre dinner drinks. Drink with meal. Coffee, Drinks available at back. AVML meal was tasty. Hard working crew on a full flight. Audio worked well.",1
Pathetic service and airline. Firstly they cancel the flights as and when they like and more over their counter staff are so useless and slow that it takes ages just to have your check in luggage weighed and sent. Never again.,0
"I like their simple cabin design and the service. Luckily, I got a ticket at a reasonable price at that time. Cabin crews were polite and seats are quite comfy, considering it was an economy class.",1
"Flew Budapest to London Luton. Terrible experience. 30 minutes delay on outbound flight and a 2 hour delay on my return flight! If you think Ryanair is bad, never fly Wizzair. The sky was clear and the weather was perfect. The only explanation for that delay is their incompetence! There are more than 100 people waiting upset in the boarding room. No one here to give us any explanation whatsoever!",0
"Abu Dhabi to Cairo. Would never ever fly with this airline again. Although I checked in through Etihad my flight was with EgyptAir. Had issues when transfering within the airport and the staff were incredibly rude and refused to listen to anything I was saying. They subsequently lost my luggage and have refused to acknowledge this. I have not once had a reply to any email, calls or tweets that I have sent. All of the numbers come up as invalid. I did receive a reply for a facebook message which was a copy and pasted version of their website instructions. I am disgusted with the whole experience.",0
"I flew from Denver to Houston with United Airlines in a cast with crutches and was left in a seat at the rear of the plane. No wheelchair offered. It was only after I was still sitting there that they thought some help was in order. I was taken by cart to my connecting gate and when I asked if these was a possibility for a restroom stop and a bottle of water I was ignored. The driver dropped me by a wheelchair and I had to ask if he could please put my bag on my lap. Still needing the facilities, I pushed my wheelchair forward two feet and crutched to it until I made it to the restroom. A passer by assisted me with getting a bottle of water. I am so disappointed and will never book again. I informed the gate person of the lack of help and also the first flight attendent in the plane. No apologies. So, here I sit in row 31 wondering what awaits me at the end of this leg.",0
"Their economy you will get more than a small bottle of water, you can expect tasty hot meal and selection of beverages including wine and beer. For me the best European airline. I appreciate their improving service.",1
"My 2 daughters and I from Toronto to Venice and back from Barcelona to Toronto. We did not upgrade and had great seats together to Venice. The personnel were very friendly and the service was very good. I was expecting much less and was pleasantly surprised. The food was average and a glass of wine was included. Also they were very attentive. The flight back from Barcelona was a little less comfortable as we were in row 7 by a window but the ""Window"" was solid at that row and jutted out a bit but the flight was so smooth and the service great that it made up for it. we just switched places a couple of times during the flight. I would definitely fly Air Transat again!",1
"I am disgusted by this airline. They are literally incompetent and do not care at all about their passengers. I had a flight scheduled from Vegas to Spokane that was canceled less than forty eight hours in advance. I did understand this, since many flights are being canceled due to COVID. However, this airline has been unbelievably unhelpful since my flight was canceled. I originally waited on the phone for more than an hour and a half to get in contact with a customer service representative to see if there was any way they could help me rebook my flight or provide compensation, as every flight is obviously significantly more expensive now than when I booked my flight on Allegiant several months ago. As this airline barely goes anywhere and has no relationship with any other airlines, they provided no way for me to get to my destination and did not seem to care at all that I'm now stuck without a way back to school. The airline did provide a small voucher for having to cancel the flight last minute but the voucher did not work, saying that my intended method of receiving the voucher was not working. I am counting on this voucher to help purchase another flight but am unable to get in contact with anyone from this garbage airline. The call wait time is scheduled for more than three hours, I received an automated response to my email saying that it would take upwards of a week to respond and that I needed to call instead. The online chat is unavailable. I thought I knew what I was getting myself into by booking Allegiant, but it's worse than I could have ever imagined. I don't care how big of a savings it is, nothing is worth the headache of this airline.",0
"Frankfurt to Budapest. This airline has terrible service. I paid for my seat reservation but when I went there, I found that it has been to given to someone else. They gave me alternative seats and all of them are at different places. calls to Customer service have heavy charge.  Luggage transfer is terrible, broke handle. Be prepared to travel inside airport approximately 30 mins in bus to board flight. I wrote an email to customer service. They respond to you once in 3 months and also , they acknowledge the issue after 3 months but it will not get resolved. I don't recommend this airline at all. My refund is still pending after they accepted that it is an issue and they will rectify it.",0
"Horrible to no service. Delayed for 5 hours and customer service basically said there's no obligation for them to be on time, no apologies, justification first. By purchasing a ticket, the customers signed an agreement that delays are no responsibility of Jetstar, they have no obligations to be accountable, it's bad luck for customers.",0
Very positive experience flying SATA from Porto to Ponta Delgada and back in. Departures and arrivals on time. Very friendly and caring cabin crew on both flights. A bit older aircrafts with the old school airline seats. ,1
"My adult special needs son travelled Sydney to Wellington and back in early January 2016 to stay with my family. We requested assisted travel as he is illiterate, gets confused and is unable to find seat on aircraft. From our first contact with Qantas staff we were personally accompanied to the correct counter, and from there he was treated with the utmost respect and consideration and informed personally of flight delay etc, was assisted to his aircraft seat and greet and meet at Wellington. On his return the assisting hostess spoke to me personally before leaving him, and he was made to feel comfortable and at ease without feeling a nuisance or burden to anyone. As his Mother and carer it gave me great relief to see how at ease he was, this is a very hard thing for a parent of a intellectually disabled person to let go. I would like Qantas staff to know how special and confident they made my son and myself feel and were great ambassadors for Qantas.",1
Detroit flight cancelled after on board for 2 hrs. Lost a night in Vegas we had to reserve rooms we did not use at our cost. Return flight 2 hrs late taking off plus 2 hrs for luggage to be unloaded in Detroit. You would think that extra fees for luggage equals better service. Paid extra for EXIT seats 32 inch legroom impossible for tall person.,0
DUB to MAN one way. Very early flight but crew very friendly and helpful. Left on time but slight delay landing in Manchester due to fog. Pilot informative about weather throughout the flight. Flight very smooth with comfortable seating. Fly often with Aer Lingus and would highly recommend.,1
Brisbane to Hamilton Island. They forced my family to split up because they made a mistake promising a seat to another guest. Putting people on the spot with no empathy. Baggage drop is also the worst experience I ever seen long queue with lack of staff presence. Absolutely avoid for the price you can pay to another airline.,0
"San Francisco to Barcelona via Lisbon. This is the worst airline I have come across and I have traveled a lot in my lifetime. Their customer service is outrageous. Their on board staff is rude and I feel like they went out of their way to provide extremely poor quality meals. They lost my luggage, when I reached Barcelona from San Francisco, it was missing. I made an online report, I could not stand in line cause about 39 people, one of the airport staff said had their luggage missing on my flight alone, the line was long and it would be too late for me to travel to my hotel late at night, they suggested I make an online complaint. My luggage reached there according to TAP after 5 days, I couldn't pick it up, I was already on a tour to Portugal. I requested them to drop it to my residence in Sacramento area. They refused and they said it's not their responsibility. It took hours of being on hold to finally get in touch with them. They said ask the airport to drop it off. When I called the airport, they said they are surprised this airline is still in business. They have had many many complaints. They have ""misplaced"" a lot of bags and it's their responsibility to deliver it to customers home, not the airport. I have made several attempts to get my luggage, now they tell me they can't find it at all. Please stay away from this nasty airline.",0
I booked a trip to fly from Houston to Lubbock with a stop in Austin. The flight went smoothly from Houston to Austin in Austin I had a 2 hour stopover until my flight to Lubbock I fell asleep and missed my flight and when I went to the gate agent saying that I missed my flight she just shrugged and showed me two boarding passes and said I could get on a flight to Lubbock via Dallas I accepted and she gave me the boarding pass. The flight to Dallas kept getting delayed because of thunderstorms in Dallas. I finally got to Lubbock at 10.50. The next morning I went on Southwest.com and went to see if my points had posted I found out they didn't so I called Southwest and they told me that I didn't receive my points because I missed my original flight. I will never fly Southwest again because they have terrible service.,0
"What a terrible start to the trip. We paid for premium seating and were given coach. Told there was nothing to do about it because the flight was full and we'd have to call for a refund. And we will. I'm just venting because there isn't anything any airline will ever do about this type of bad customer service. Air Canada is just another addition to a long list of airlines who don't really care about their customers. They just are collecting dollars hoping for the people who won't chase down the refunds. And we didn't even choose this airline. They partner with United and we got stuck. Thanks, United.",0
"Copenhagen to Manchester. First time flying with SAS, and very impressed. Very nice cabin, comfortable seats, friendly staff, and they give out free tea, coffee and water twice for the 1h40 flight was a nice touch. Flight was punctual. I would highly recommend SAS.",1
Terrible company. Made us wait 30 minutes on the taxiway because they didn't have a gate. Changed my son's flight to an overnight 23 hour trip vs the original 10 hour trip and told me it was an equivalent flight and would do nothing to help us even though an another acceptable flight was available. Only available to us if we paid more. Even a supervisor would not help. Horrible customer experience.,0
"Louisville to Buffalo via Tampa. I had to abruptly leave a business trip when I found out my dog was very ill with little chance of survival. The gate attendant was extremely helpful making sure I had all the proper connecting information, as well as organizing all of my previous cancelled flight information and credits. Once on my first flight the flight attendant was so incredible when I told her about my concern for our delay and the if I did not make my connecting flight I would not make it home in time to say goodbye to my dog. She kindly asked all the people on the plane if they could sit and allow me to get off first and asked everyone to keep my puppy in their hearts. I do not know the name of this wonderful flight attendant, but I will never forget her.",1
"We booked a flight from Kuwait to Toronto via Istanbul, myself my husband and kids, on December 31 2015, with 3 hrs transit through Istanbul. The first flight was 90 min delayed without. Upon arrival to Istanbul we missed our second flight. Ataturk airport was a chaos. Nobody knew where is the Turkish Airlines ticketing office is and when found it, it was 3 hours waiting line. The ground staff are few to handle the chaos. There is overbooking to Toronto, so we had to change the booking heading to Montreal instead of Toronto on the next day. The airport hotel is overbooked. The airline did not cover costs of my stay in Istanbul since we have to get in another 3 hrs waiting line just to ask for that, and you have to apply for Turkish visa. The next flight got 5 hrs delayed without notification. The lounges and restaurants at the airport are crowded. I am writing this review while am still stuck in Ataturk's airport.",0
"It is a normal day with pleasant weather in Delhi. My flight was supposed to depart at 8.45pm to Hyderabad. I arrived at T2 of Indira Gandhi International Airport by 7pm. As of now only GoAir is operating from this terminal. I slowly started listening announcments for the flights much before mine that, due to delays in incoming aircraft, the flights got delayed. This happened for 6 flights at a time. I do not understand how can it happen for all the flights simultaneously. So many passengers got stranded. Not a single person to give proper information. All flights got delayed by atleast 2 hours on a perfect normal day. This looks mostly like a logistics gone wrong issue. This is my worst airport experience with no concerned authoriy for redressal. If you are reading this review, never book flights with this airlines.",0
Stansted to Fuerteventura cannot believe that unless you priority board they will separate you from your children. Surely this cannot be a suitable situation in the case of an emergency how are under five's expected to understand the safety information.,0
"Phuket to Dublin via Moscow. We landed in Moscow at 8pm missing our connecting flight which was taking off at 7.40pm. When we got off the aircraft and were directed to an information desk, which was crowded with people. It was a two hour wait before we got speaking to someone at this desk to be advised that we had to go to another information desk as they couldn't solve our issue. Eventually after 6 hours we were issued with our new flight details and told we would be given accommodation as the next flight out was 7.40pm the following evening. We had to wait a further hour for a bus to cobring us to hotel Novotel.  Arriving at the hotel we were escorted by security and had to wait another hour to be given key cards and directed to our rooms. As a smoker we came back out of our rooms to see where we could go and advised by security that we were not allowed leave, checking the main hall door finding it was locked and then to be advised to smoke in the bathroom of our rooms with no smoking signs everywhere! Fire safety practices reduced to zero at this hotel! Next morning we were escorted to a hall down stairs for breakfast and later, lunch. Breakfast was a slice of ham and cheese with stale bread, lunch was cold. The treatment we received was awful and disrespectful. Eventually arriving at our final destination to be advised one part of our luggage was still in Moscow.",0
I paid for priority check in and priority boarding for me and my partner on our outbound flight from Birmingham on 26th June and our inbound flight on 3rd July. At Birmingham we ended up going through the normal check in as the priority check in was busier and in Palma the priority check in lane was full of normal check in passengers and if my partner hadn't complained to the check in staff we would have had to line up with those that hadn't paid. Even then we had to wait behind a large family that had commenced check in although they hadn't paid for priority. At boarding the staff member just allowed anyone through onto the plane even though he had used his tannoy to state that priority boarding passengers would be loaded first. Monarch offer and charge for a service then fail to deliver. It is one big scam.,0
"Budapest to Krakow with LOT Polish Airlines. Terrible service. Flight canceled due to Covid. Online form filled for refund. 2 months later, nothing. When contacting them, they just say ""you must wait"". The friends I would have met there all received their refunds in days from other airlines.",0
I traveled easyJet from Geneva to Manchester. Flight departed a little later than scheduled time but this was no problem . The flight crew were welcoming and were active and kept the cabin clean. Only downside is that there isn't much leg room but this is expected using a budget airline.,1
"United Airlines flight 1126 from Newark to Pittsburgh was delayed by over an hour due to the plane arriving late then switched to mechanical issues. Upon boarding the cabin was over 90 degrees. They sat us in those conditions for another hour and the cabin was well over 100 degrees at this point. The flight attendants and pilots stated they'd issue a refund on our tickets for this inconvenience. We taxi out to the tarmac where we circled and sat for roughly 1.5 hours. Finally the captain says we cannot take off and returns us to the gate. Prior to deplaning the staff said customer service would be outside to assist with refunds and rebooking. However, no agents were available and they directed us to gate C91 for customer service. The line was long and I stood for 7 hours waiting for assistance before customer service began going home without getting others to assist us. A few agents finally said to find your own way and call the 800 number for a refund. I get my ticket since they said they wont help me and told me I'd get a refund for getting a new ticket. Very unclear instructions from customer service. Now I've spent the last 6 days trying to get a solution only for United Airlines to tell me I can't be issued a refund because both tickets are used. How is it that United Airlines employees told me what to do, I comply, pay extra for their lack of service, and they cannot issue a refund? That does not seem legal or fair. And based on their refund policies I'm entitled a full refund but they are not upholding it and keep rejecting my refund request. 0 integrity from United Airlines.",0
I wanted to reschedule my tickets to Belgrade and it was done quickly and smoothly. The whole procedure took five minutes on the phone and the customer support answered my emailed questions in a matter of a few hours. Staff have a great level of English and are friendly. The service and food on board flight are excellent as well.,1
Miami to Toronto. Departure time was delayed. Seats very uncomfortable. Something wrong with the temperature control so it was very hot throughout the flight. The food was less than adequate. We ordered the pizza and the crust was hard and sauce mushy on top. No pepperoni to be had. I ordered a wine and ended up having to get up and remind the flight attendant she owed me a wine. This is the worst flight we have taken.,0
They have a new policy that no seat must be left empty yet their planes have rows of 3 seats. So if you are travelling with a group of 2 you are not allowed to sit next together as long as there are free single places or you are willing to pay 100 euros extra. There is nothing premium about their premium class. Unfortunately if you are flying from The Netherlands you have no other option for most tourist locations.,0
"Las Vegas to Des Moines.  Cancellation was notified 5 minutes before shuttle arrived to take us to airport, and was advised next flight out was Sunday, which was 4 days later, they didn't care if one was stranded! Our only option was to drive 24hrs back to Iowa. Will never fly Allegiant again, and advise that unless you have another way back from your destination you shouldn't either.",0
"Abbotsford to Hamilton. Service overall was very good. I did have to call in to make a change to my ticket but they were very helpful. The call centre wait time was a bit long at about 40 minutes but the person was very apologetic for the wait and helpful once connected. The flight itself was excellent, there were free movies on board through the Swoop app. You have to buy everything on board including water but what do you expect on a ULCC? The planes were nice and modern. I would fly again with them happily.",1
Flew to Singapore and returned from Bangkok via Brunei. I didn't know what to expect as previous to this I had never heard of Royal Brunei. I found that economy was surprisingly spacious. Flights both ways were not full so had a spare seat next to me. Meals on board were more than enough however as I am a big eater the flight attendants were more than happy to accommodate this. The stopover in Brunei was only 45 minutes so the actual time spent doing nothing was about 15 minutes. The only problem if I had to pick on was the small screen sizes but in the end it didn't really bother me. Would definitely fly again.,1
Recent trip Seville to Paris. On time. Clean plane. Friendly staff with good English. Excellent seats near emergency doors,1
I flew from Glasgow to Halifax in August 2014 with Europe Airpost. I was attracted by the great ticket price and a direct flight to Halifax Nova Scotia. The ticket was almost half the price of the major international airlines. An extra leg room seat cost 19 Euro each outward and 7 Euro return each fantastic value. The flight was very pleasant a clean aircraft complimentary newspapers headsets and meals. The crew was pleasant but unobtrusive. Flights in both directions departed and arrived on time. It is the first transatlantic flight I have made in a small aircraft like this Boeing 737 it resulted in smaller than normal queues to embark and disembark and also to reclaim baggage. Not much else can be said except great flight great price I wish air travel was always like this.,1
Flew from JFK to TPE in Royal Laurel class. Their service is extremely nice. The crew went out of their way serving especially elderly people. Seats were very comfortable and relaxing. The amenity kit had everything we needed. Food was good. Flight attendants were simply sweet. They were serving with a nice smile the entire 15 hrs flight which I have never experienced before on any other airline. The lounge in TPE is huge with impeccable service. very attentive friendly staff.,1
"Flight in Chicago had a 4 hour delay so we were delayed, almost missed our connection Air Canada let everyone off the plane instead of just the people with the imminent connections. Being on the back of the plane, things didn't look good Following that the agents barely listened to our questions on how to get to connections in time instead directed us to customs and immigration. After 30 minutes in line, got to the customs agent, he says, ""why are you here? I'll walk you to connections."" Of course we missed the plane. Then the air Canada customer support agent in Toronto was useless. He let it slip that just the 4 of us missed our flight. And that it was our problem. We couldn't leave the airport and gave us one hotel room for 4 people. Went to CBP and again, they say ""why weren't you escorted""? We weren't supposed to walk where the Air Canada agents sent us alone.  I did file for reimbursement, but judging by the job Air Canada's done so far, that won't happen. They proceeded to lose our luggage and return it to us on our 9th and last day of our trip. Followed by not letting part of our party board because our recovery letter didn't said ""recovered from covid"" xx date signed by a doctor but missed the words ""for travel.""",0
"I had the most amazing experience with Qatar Airways. I landed in Doha from Toronto and the Qatar staff made sure that the passengers knew where they needed to go and helped navigate the airport. The lounge was exceptionally clean, convenient and quiet. I flew on QR 534. Manasvi and Sharan, the flight attendants did an amazing job taking care of me on the flight. My experience flying with them for 3 hours was way better than the experience with Air Canada for 13 hours. Manasvi and Sharan both made me feel very comfortable and showed that they cared. Thank you!!",1
"Very unhappy. Next to no assistance from staff. Website not updated with current information. My 82 yr old mum was in distress. the airline preponed the flight with no information to her as a passenger neither to the agent. When we called Bangkok the only option as no local phone numbers on the website for Australia worked, we were told they are ok to give us a full refund or the other option was to take the passenger to the airport and if there is a no show they will try and book her on.",0
"Lanseria to Cape Town with Kulula. Worst airline ever, stuck at the airport because flight left from Durban to Lanseria airport with a damaged fire extinguisher. We have a 3 hour delay because we have to wait for another flight to bring a spare fire extinguisher! This is ridiculous! Couldn't even offer meal vouchers or even juice box for kids.",0
Manila to New York via Tokyo. I am very happy with the service and cleanliness of this aircraft! ANA and the FAs are very helpful and accommodating. They are also helpful during the flight not only with my baby but other babies too. They are mindful to our needs as a family and always courteous and polite.,1
Ticket was cheap for this flight but my return ticket is almost double. Since I have to change planes in Las Vegas I know I'm told I have to pay twice for a checked bag. I will never fly Spirit Airlines again. I thought it was bad you have to sit in each other's laps but you just lost a frequent flier.,0
"This airline delayed for over an hour on multiple flights. This last one was apparently due to paperwork that needed to be done before we took off? I'm not sure what kind of nonsense that is but it's sounds like a complete waste of everyone's time. Instead of getting the entire plane where we needed to go we sat at the gate for hours due to this ""paperwork"". I used to love flying Southwest and now I will choose a different airline that actually cares about their passengers.",0
Booked premium seating and chose rows 4 and 5 as these were best seats available on the seating plan I rang customer services to explain that my daughter was disabled and would prefer seats on the side of the plane that the toilet was situated if possible just for the ease of it. They explained that this was not possible as all the other seats were taken. I accepted this however on the day we were given seats next to the toilet which was perfect. The staff on this flight from Newcastle 17th June 2013 10.35am flight were very good friendly helpful and attentive best cabin crew I've had. The food was reasonable drinks were plenty. The only bad point I had but it didn't bother me a lot was mould on the cheese sandwich given towards end of flight. Flight left on time.,1
"London to Cairo. First, on this 5 hour mid morning flight the only complimentary food and drink were a tiny bag of pretzels and a small bottle of water. Even Southwest is more generous. When unable to connect my phone to order food, I hit the FA call button with no response for more than an hour. When the FA came to collect garbage I had to show him the call light and he gruffly asked me what was the matter. He used his phone to place the order.",0
"Pathetic service. These people will never provide a direct flight. They will always cancel the direct flight for which you paid for and will give you the option to choose their alternative connecting flight or refunding the money. They did the same with me, my sister and my brother. They informed us just a week before the due to some technical reason the flight got cancelled. Taking a refund was not an option for me because the price of other flights were really high the time they informed us. So I was only left with the option to take the 8 hrs long connecting flight.",0
"It is one of the worst flights ever. They have the meanest ground staff and their customer service is horrible, the wait time is 2 hours to get hold of someone in customer service. The food served on board is nasty and its the bare minimum. Never fly again with them!",0
"Joined MAS Enrich programme after I'm being continuously bombarded by emails requests to do so, but once a member, I get more emails with ""fly away"" very annoying comments like earn your enrich points via manage my booking online. Now what, where, how is that? These ridiculous fly away comments implies you must know what they're saying, well frankly I don't, and I find it insulting frankly, to imply rather then advise appropriately. Emailed MAS, a reply three days later, sounded more condescending, with exactly the same fly away comment but this time as if adding salt to injury states, call our customer service if need help! Finally with a friend, we went onto their website, clicked manage my bookings, got into my actual flight details but no where we could see that mentions enrich? After much poking around, we found it further embedded in My details! but when I try to type in MH number, that input box is locked! Computer says no! We gave up, total waste of time",0
"Las Vegas to Atlanta. The worst experience ever that I received. For someone whose scared to fly I believe they need to be better at their service. If something going wrong with the flight I believe that there should be communication being given to passengers. If a passenger explained that their flight leaves at a certain time, like 20 min from now what you don't do is tell the person whose seated way in the back to hurry up and make it to they flight in order to make it. When their difficulty happening on the plane. There was no type of order. To be paying for a flight I do wish to get treated right and not being disrespected to and treated as if I'm nothing.",0
Hong Kong to London. Great airline indeed! Staff were friendly and helpful! The aircraft was very clean. The crews are diverse. Will definitely fly again.,1
"Another absolute disgrace. Just a low cost carrier dressed up.  Very poor attitude. How about some common courtesy? Please jut let them go bankrupt, so Australia can get a real airline.",0
"Delta Air Lines did not fail to disappoint me again. Bad experience every time I fly with them. I just flew Business class a few days ago, and the air hostesses were rude and did not even try to accommodate. I will prefer to fly economy with Lufthansa, better service.",0
Newark to Toronto. I am appalled how bad this airline is. Loud prop planes with no TVs and not even wifi. But worse is the fact that a huge snowstorm was hitting the day I was due to return and they don't wave change fees in advance like  other airline. They only wave change fees if your flight is canceled or delayed significantly which means everyone is left scrambling the day off a major weather event. This is especially galling for an airline that operates out of a city that gets its share of winter weather.,0
Flew Nairobi to Zanzibar with Fly540.com. Excellent airline. Flights are prompt arriving and take off is to the minute on time. Ground staff are helpful as are the cabin crew. Planes are clean and appear well maintained. Baggage arrives with the passengers. A good way to fly locally in E Africa.,0
"Dubrovnik to Gatwick with British Airways operated by Titan Airways. A fantastic flight, a very nice and modern cabin interior with lots of legroom and very friendly crew. Would definitely fly with Titan again!",1
"Doha to Amsterdam on March 20th. In our cabin the attandent was Mrs Gisella. We want to compliment her. A very pleasant, friendly lady. The level of service was very high. She worked very hard and constantly. This review is one of appreciation! He",1
"Denver to San Francisco. Worst service ever my first flight was canceled waited two days to get a flight to San Jose the only flight available was to San Francisco. . I had paid extra for zone one isle seat, upon cancellation of my first flight. I was specific as to the location of the seat and was told it was confirmed, when I entered the plane I was not given the seat I paid for. In regards to customer this company failed miserably.",0
"I travelled Etihad Airways from London to Kathmandu on 11th December, and it was one of the worst ever. First thing you will be given the menu but when it comes to your place you won't get the meal of your choice because they got limited and you will be given veg Pasta which is one of the worst. If you are in last group of boarding your hand luggage will be given to the cargo with main luggage and they gonna say you that there is no enough space because it's a small aircraft. Its the third day of my arrival to Kathmandu and still today I have not got my main luggage. I have been wearing same dress for three days and planning to buy some today. It's really disgusting.",0
Booked a flight for June 5th Medellin to Kelowna with Cheapoair. April 26 the flight has changed or cancelled with info as to which. Very poor info with no explanation. Tried to call reservations which is not working. Can't change the flight info online. It would appear that Copa has withdrawn the flight but is not providing credits. Cheapoair is Cheap o service.,0
"Had the best two flight attendants ever on MH4, they did the job properly and with a smile. Sat upstairs on a day flight in economy and had a good flight experience. Well done to the two guys who worked there socks off going the extra mile for the passengers in the full section of the plane.",1
New York JFK to Delhi. Air India is a wonderful airline. The service is great. The only problems are that the seats cushion are uncomfortable and the inflight entertainment screen is a pain to use. Otherwise everything else is good and the flight was on time.,1
Jogjakarta to Banjarmasin. I arrived at the airport in around 9 o'clock in the morning and my flight should depart at 11.30  but it got delayed for an hour so we departed at around 12.30. Seat pocket was very dirty. Ac was turned off and it was very hot. Bad this time. At least the flight attendant smiled at me once.,0
San Antonio to Chicago. Majority of the time my flights and everyone I know that has flew American has a delayed flight due to maintenance. No back up aircraft available so delays are hours if not canceled. Most aircraft is old and has no outlets for charging. We all carry electrics now days and need to keep them charged. The new aircraft have more narrow cramped seats with no leg or hip room. I'm small compared to most adult so that is ridiculous. Also the seats are tilted forward which make you feel like your sliding out of an already uncomfortable seat. 1 out of 2 staff is rude and in accommodating when trying to change to an open seat that no one will be flying in. Yes people pay more to ensure they have a reserved seats of their preference but if it's empty just prior to boarding why not allow others to take an open seat. I will not choose to fly American if I have other options.,0
"To Izmir. My husband is 6. 2"" tall and I am 5.10"". We could not believe it when we sat down my husband could not get his legs in the seat space he had to spend the whole journey out with knees in the aisle. Coming back yesterday we made sure our cases went on the bus last so we could grab them quick on arrival and head the queue to get an exit seat which we did and it was much more comfortable. We didn't eat anything so can't comment on that. Would never travel with them again. We have done lots of travelling and it is the leaat leg room we have had. The flight was on time both ways.",0
"San Francisco to Denpasar via Taipei. This is the second time I have flown this route on EVA Air. Both times the flight was good. The aircraft were newer, flights left on time, and service was fine. I was able to find good very rates on this route since my dates were flexible. I would choose this airline again.",1
"Best staff ever. Great little airline. We did 5 flights in all, every one on time. Staff super friendly and helpful. We connected in Belize and got through immigration much faster than expected. They put us on an earlier flight and even called our hotel to pick us up early. Excellent service!!!! Planes are small propeller type, so no real in flight service or drinks etc, also note no toilets on board. Flight from Cancun took an hour and a half so worth keeping in mind. They use the private FBO terminal in Cancun airport so make sure your taxi knows that when going to the airport. All in all super friendly, everything was on time, these are small planes but all were smooth even through dark clouds. Very well organised ground staff, a pleasant change from flying through big terminals on big airlines.",1
Fly with anyone else. They were uniformative. This was the first and last time I will ever fly with american airlines. They damaged my luggage. It was the first time I had ever used the luggage. It was ripped and there are holes in the front. They also broke the wheel so it doesn't roll properly anymore.,0
"Zurich to Newark. Fantastic, exceeded expectations. Food was great, flight crew attentive. Bumpy flight made better by flight crew. Nonstop food and snacks. Highly recommend.",1
We have not been on vacation for 3 years and desperately needed to get away and I was a nervous wreck that our flight would be delayed or cancelled. I went on Spirit's website and read about the baggage policy etc. Thank goodness I did because I had booked it through Priceline or else I would not have had any idea. I also picked seats for all 4 flights for myself husband and child. I ended up paying what I would have to fly another airline so not a big deal. All of my flights were on time. No issues at all. I have recently flown Delta and United and had issues with both of them. Bottom line I was pleasantly surprised with my experience and would fly with them again.,1
Flight Hong Kong to Zurich. A night flight and so the sleeping position was a key test. The seat makes up into a fully flat slightly narrow but very comfortable bed. The seat layouts are unusual and I was in the K rows which are all single window seats. The shelf and storage spaces are much better than many business seats and the table for meals also large. Meals were tastefully served by smiling staff. Excellent value for money.,1
Beijing to Boston. Very impressed by the excellent service supplied by Huang. She is smiled and asked what I needed. She answered all questions asked. We really appreciate her service. I enjoy this trip with Hainan Airlines,1
"Montenegro to Cairo via Rome. Worst airline I've ever taken and the rudest staff on and off the plane. I heard so many bad things about Alitalia before but never thought it would be this bad. After a 6 hour delay, they didn't even bother to do anything about it, no one cares. My grandma needs to be on a wheelchair and there was no assistance what so ever, in fact, after they got her a wheelchair they left her at the rome airport at a random gate without even checking where she wanted to go and they took the wheelchair away from her after we explained she couldnt move without it! They were extremely rude and impolite, and couldn't care less. Not recommended even if it is the cheapest flight available, you will be frustrated the whole time, it's not worth it at all. Huge disappointment, never flying Alitalia again.",0
"I purchased ticket economy class on China Eastern for about almost half price of competing airlines, then after reading reviews was somewhat scared that I had made a big mistake, but I had no problems. People posted that flight attendants were rude with bad movies and lots flight delays and no baggage transfers, I had no issues at all. This was my third trip to the Philippines and had used two other airlines before and had delays, my trip with China Eastern went great with no delays, baggage was auto transfered, movie section good and flight attendants were very pleasant. As meals go we were served two meals and it's airline food, no worse or better than competing airlines.",1
"Flight was delayed 8 hours in total, and staff were clueless when it comes to basic communication, informing passengers about flight details and helping people reschedule. Was a total joke and never flying Air India again.",0
"Barcelona to Stockholm with Vueling, and because I have a lack of time I don't want to check in any luggage. I am just bringing hand luggage to save time. They take my hand luggage when entering the plane and check it in anyway, because they have lack of space for all the hand luggage. Apparently you have to be fast to check in at the plane if you want to be sure to bring your hand luggage. They are rude and unfriendly. I will never fly with them again.",0
"Beijing to Taipei with EVA Air, and the boarding and settling in the cabin was very simple.  The flat bed on such a short flight made me feel so comfortable that I wanted to stay for longer. Crew performance was very good. Arriving in TPE without any troubles.",1
Amsterdam to Madrid. Always problems with checking online. Then as a platinum frequent flyer I can't choose seat online and then I have the worst seats. Only airline I have had this problem. Even budget airlines like Ryanair or WizzAir provide better service than Air Europa.,0
Our first flight to Kenya on the Dreamliner 787 Dec 10th 2013. All cabin staff welcoming and helpful. Flight started off on time but due to people arriving late and luggage going missing we sat on the Tarmac for nearly an hour before we took off. Flight went smoothly and was non eventful. We were in premium class and seats were comfortable and leg room more than adequate. Only gripe was that the centre arm rest which stored the screens stuck out making it difficult to manoeuvre when people in front had their seats reclined. Usually feel rubbish for first few days on arrival in Kenya but can honestly say I didn't have that jet lagged feeling this time. The flight back on 24th Dec was as equally comfortable. Again all cabin staff friendly and hard working. Slight problem with water leaking but that soon stopped once we were airborne. Again flight went smoothly with no problems. Plenty of duty fees available on flight back. The food was edible on both flights and drinks were constantly flowing. We had to disembark at south terminal due to flooding in north terminal. That was a nightmare and took 1.5 hrs to get suitcases. No announcements made so it was a case of wait and see. We enjoyed our Dreamliner experience.,1
"Tenerife to Washington via Keflavik. Very rude unprofessional get agents no respect for elders. We fly from Spain to Keflavik and then we were asked to pay extra for small wallet size hand bag on our connecting flight from Keflavik to Wasington which we end up shoving it on the side pocket of our carry on luggage . We were disappointed by the inconsistent, unprofessional, cold and rude behavior of the agent. She even said ""you will not board this plane if you don't behave"" just for trying to explain that we had the same carryon items that was allowed on our flight from Tenerife to Keflavik. My overall experience with this Airlines was very bad. What seems a cheeper price at the begging ended up being more than the other airlines. This was the worst experience I ever had.",0
Hong Kong to Seoul INC Tashkent to Seoul INC Seoul INC to Hong Kong. Planes were very clean and well maintained cabin crew very smart and friendly fast response to requests good meal choices AVOD excellent with a wide choice and many latest movies. Toilets very well kept and cleaned regularly. Highly recommended airline to everyone better than Cathay Pacific and as good as All Nippon Airways.,1
I cannot find one thing to say about this airline that is complimentary. Had a flight from Orlando to home and arrived 2 hrs early. Line and kiosks were absolutely packed. And why is that? Because there are only 2 check in people working. Of course I am late for my flight and spend the rest of the day trying to get on a stand by. AA workers at the gates very unhelpful and dismissive. Tell me if I am not some kind of gold customer I cant be put on a stand by list. Terrible customer service in every way. I will never fly them again and do not recommend anyone else to either!,0
Anchorage to Kenai. Worst airline I have flown. They cancelled a plane an hour after it was supposed to leave then the next flight was an hour late. Then when we finally arrived we had to wait twenty minutes to get off.,0
"Reunion to Johannesburg with Air Austral. One of the worst experience I have had. After we took off from Reunion, the flight had to go back to Reunion because of the technical fault. When we arrived at the airport nobody from the airline bothered to explain the next step and nobody at the airline spoke English. We only saw on the boarding gate the time for departure. This made us miss our connecting flight. Upon arrival at Johannesburg we tried to negotiate with the Manager and ask her to find flights home for us. She said there was nothing she can do for us. I can assure everybody who wants to take this airline that cheap is expensive. We ended up rebooking our flights.",0
"Bangkok to Hong Kong. Ground service was efficient. However, some delays happened because of terrible weather.  The cabin staff offered me a blanket. The hardware was fine. A dinner was served in the 3 hour flight.",1
"Luton to Varna. This is the second time flying with Wizz Air. First time was in June to Riga. Having flown to Sofia two years ago then driving to Varna, we decided on flying direct which meant using Luton Airport. We were dubious about using Wizz after reading so many bad comments. However, in our experiences Wizz Air provide a value for money package. There is more legroom than on Easy Jet and Ryanair. The staff at the airport and onboard were polite and smiling. The online booking system is easy to use. So no complaints and we look forward to continue flying with Wizz as and when required",1
"Claustrophobic business cabin, with one bathroom, seats become beds only apparently for someone 5 feet 11 perhaps, awful, limited options food, no business lounge in LAX, no internet on board. Limited movie collection. A serious ripoff. Think before clicking.",0
Never again! Our flight from the Gold Coast to Melbourne was cancelled last weekend with 2 hours notice. We received notification via an sms. We phoned the airline who did not at the time offer us an alternate flight so we booked another flight that day with Jetstar. When we arrived at the airport we asked for an explanation at the Tigerair counter. We were told we could fly later that day from Brisbane or the next day from the Gold Coast but this had not been offered to us earlier and we had made alternate arrangements and paid premium prices for tickets. There seems to be a complete lack of regard for peoples circumstances and inconvenience resulting from cancelled flights. We will never again fly with them.,0
"Belgrade to Milan. Terrible service, too expensive, strange rules for cabin bags, rude employees, bad organization. In airplane there is no free food even when you pay for bought bags.",0
"I booked the flight from Delhi to Leh and back, when I was supposed to be coming back on 8th Feb, 2019, my flight got cancelled by Jet Airways, I have began the process for refund which they claimed will be refunded within 8 to 10 days. Even after 11 days, I didn't get the refund, so I called again and they process it once again and ask me to wait for 8 to 10 days. I did and still there is no refund, now that I call there customer care, they are not even picking up the phone. I have more things to do than writing this review and calling jet airways again and again, so be mindful..",0
"Winnipeg to Abbotsford. Our experience with Swoop was very positive. Saved a lot of money and absolutely no problems at all. The flights were on time, cabin staff were great. Check in was fast and a pleasant experience. Will definitely fly with Swoop again.",1
Phoenix to Honolulu. The worst trip ever. Every American airlines flight had some type of mechanical issue. 3 times in less than 24 hours causing me to miss my son's birthday.,0
"Palma to Southampton. I was delighted to learn of this new airline from Southampton and booked 2 holidays for the summer. The first was on time leaving Southampton in July but delayed 2 hours on return frustrating but no big deal. The second was delayed 2 hours going out and 3.5 hours coming home. Not once was the offer of refreshments and when I asked for a complimentary drink on board a very rude attendant said no. After the experience I submitted a claim for the legal compensation of 250 euros each passenger. After a few emails I was offered 50 euros each. We decided to accept given our flights were very cheap and provided all bank details. 3 months on and many emails sent with no response I still haven't received compensation. This company are so blatantly arrogant and rude, with zero knowledge of customer services. Please don't use them if you want to arrive on time and to be treated with the respect you deserve as a paying customer. ",0
"Manchester to New York via Dublin with Aer Lingus. Left the miserable staff of Manchester airport for the smiley staff of Dublin airport. Strolled through security and immigration without problem. Boarded our flight, greeted by lovely staff who couldn't do enough for us, and this went on for the whole flight. They dealt with a gentleman who took ill as we were taxiing and had to leave the flight with such care and professionalism. The wine choice was very good as was the food for inflight dining. The cabin was clean and fresh with plenty of room and wifi! On arrival at JFK our luggage was there within minutes, and we left the airport without that awful standing in line to clear immigration you normally have. Return flight overnight on Sept 22nd another brilliant experience, thanks to the friendly crew who carried out duties with a focused attitude. We were extremely impressed with the overall experience. Well done Aer Lingus and Dublin airport.  As soon as we trade in our BA air miles we will become Aer Lingus customers. ",1
Denver to Phoenix. Run don't walk! Don't be fooled by Spirit Airlines low prices. They get you everywhere they can and on top of it the line at airports just to drop bags is insane with like 1 clerk working! Never again. Crowd on plane low cost for sure.,0
Thank you Virgin America agents for everything and for your amazing service. My mom and dad who don't speak English at all were in a terrible situation of possibility to miss their connecting flight to Moscow if not for the Virgin America agents who helped them to collect their luggage and guide them through terminals! SFO to9 LAX Virgin America flight was delayed due to some mechanical problems and arrived at LAX 3 hours later than it was supposed to be. So they arrived at LAX an hour before their international flight to Moscow! I thought I was gonna die having to deal with all of that. I called Virgin America customer service and a very nice gentlemen sent a message to the plane crew that 2 passengers were running late to their next flight and need assistance! There are no words to explain how grateful I am for your help! Virgin America have the best service! ,1
"Naples to Rome. We booked our tickets through Kayak and were not informed of the baggage policies beyond the usual thing. When we traveled from Palermo to Naples, we were allowed to check one bag and carry on a bag with no additional fees. However, the problem began on our flight from Naples to Rome. When we went to check our bags, we were informed our checked bags were each over 8 kg. They charged us 53 Euros per bag to check them. The ticket agent gave us a lot of misleading information about what our options were. According to their company policies, we were charged the wrong excess baggage fee but they won't even refund that and charge us the right fee.  Take the train for much less money, no baggage restrictions, etc.",0
"Rio de Janeiro to Berlin via Amsterdam. Thanks to KLM our daughter could come back home safe from the other end of the world, although it took several days and rebooking. KLM was the first airline to offer rebooking as good as it was possible with the many customers around the world. Our family has been flying KLM quite often and has always been lucky to have very friendly crews!",1
It seems to have become the norm for United Express to not announce any delays until everyone is checked in. Then the announcements come every half hour increasing the wait time. Our flight from Halifax to Newark was to depart at 1.10 pm and eventually left after 5pm. Our return flight was to leave at 8.38 pm and left after midnight. Never ever again.,0
"Had to connect at Detroit to Boston. Flight landed at Detroit around 2.55, for a 3.20 connection. Talked to the flight attendent, who assured us multiple times that we would be able to make it to our connection. We ended up being excessively late. I normally wouldn't be upset about something like this, but I have been on several flights where they let off people that needed to reach a connection quickly. There was an available solution and the employee failed to use it.",0
The first and last time on Sunwing. I checked the flight departure time before leaving for the airport at 3.30 am. It showed that flight was on time but when I arrived at the airport the flight information screen showed that our flight was 3.5 hours delayed from 6 am to 9.30 am. We went to the check in counter and the staff had no idea that our flight was delayed. Airport staff were so unprofessional and unfriendly. The reason for the flight was that cabin crew needed more rest. At 8.30 they made another announcement to inform us that that flight was delayed again to 10.30 am but retracted the delay half an hour later and put it back to 9.30 am. Flight attendants looked very tired and were unfriendly. Our return flight was even worse. We boarded the plane on time but as soon as we reached the runway pilot announced that they had to bring the aircraft back to the terminal because there was an engine problem. They didn't let us off the plane and brought mechanics to fix the problem which took over 2 hours. Never flying Sunwing airlines again.,0
My husband and I were booked to fly from Honolulu to Vancouver on Air Canada Rouge on Thursday December 18 at 11.15pm. Moments after pushing back from the gate the pilot addressed the passengers to tell us there was a small problem with the brakes and maintenance would be called to inspect and repair them. After several announcements and hours later there was no resolution. The Air Canada ground staff had no authority to provide answers to the passenger. By 2.30am we still had zero information and the Air Canada staff told us they could not provide us with food vouchers or water. They had no access to blankets or pillows either. Families with small children and infants as well as the elderly were unfortunately required to be patient or leave the gate and go to a hotel as their own expense. By 4.30 am we were still at the gate but the flight crew was relieved of their duty and sent to a hotel. Passengers demanded answers and grew angrier but the ground crew was unable to provide any assistance as they waited for instructions from head office. By 6.30am we were told that Air Canada was trying to find hotel accommodations for the passengers but we needed to be patient. By 7.15 we were instructed to go and wait downstairs and a shuttle bus would take us to a nearby airport hotel. Again there was no assistance to escort families with children or the elderly to the shuttle bus location. By 7.45am the first of three buses arrived and we were taken to the hotel. Hotel staff told us to wait as they had not been given authority to check us in. In total the last passenger to be checked in at the hotel was processed by 10am. Air Canada Rouge is the worst airline I have ever experienced.,0
"We flew very last minute due to a family emergency. I was a wreck and the reps in Toronto knew our circumstances and handled everything as I was not thinking clearly. I was having a breakdown on the plane and the flight attendant brought us up to first class behind the curtain to give us privacy. She was amazing on calming me down. She offered us food and drinks. Upon deplaning a pilot who was flying with them came back to let us off the plane first due to our emergency. From Toronto to Calgary, we were treated with so much compassion.",1
"I have flown with RAM in the past and did not have the greatest experience in that the aircraft seemed old.  All I can say is , wow they have really improved. The airplane was brand new and quite comfortable. The flight attendants were very attentive and kind. The food was very good and every 2 hours they were bringing personal bottles of water. I would say if you had a bad experience in the past, definitely give them another try and you will be pleasantly surprised.",1
"Miami to Gatwick via Keflavik, Worst experience ever regarding luggage. Our luggage was delayed when we landed on the Friday night. The staff at the airport were slow unhelpful and didn't even give us the information we needed. Wow air did little to help with the situation. We were left without our luggage until the Wednesday. The biggest joke of all was that the luggage arrived on the Monday night and we were 50 miles away from the airport and they were going to get it to us Thursday evening. In the end I had to spend 4 hours on the phone and then had to pick it up from a Fedex on the Wednesday. Throughout the whole experience we were barely kept in the loop about what was happening and had to constantly phone.",0
"Humberside to Aberdeen with Eastern Airways, and the first time I have flown from Humberside and it will be the last. Arrived at the airport two hours before departure to check in for my flight only to find that Eastern Airways had no staff available on the check in or on the customer service desk. Contacted them by phone and was told that no one would be available until an hour before flight departure. Great customer service.",0
"My flight for 21st November from Taipei to Bangkok was cancelled for 3 times, and Thai Airways resisted that since the ticket I bought was not refundable, they wouldn't refund me even it's Thai airways cancelled the flights without any reasons given.",0
Just back from a trip from Sydney to Vietnam via K.L. At 194 cms tall I always try for an exit or aisle seat. In Sydney outbound I was first in the Online check in 3 hours before take off only to be told that the plane was full and that I was stuck with the seat I had been allocated which turned out to be in the middle of a 4 seat section. It was an A300 plane and very uncomfortable. In K.L I approached the transfer desk and was assured that I now had an exit seat to Saigon. It turned out to be a very tight window seat nowhere near the exit. On coming back from Hanoi again first in line at check in I was again assured that I had exit seats on both planes to Sydney. Again the Hanoi flight turned out to be a tight window seat nowhere near the exit. Approached the transfer desk in K.L again to be told no exit or aisle seats available except the youngish lady next to this fellow interrupted to point out that there was an aisle seat available and then proceeded to give it to me. Why is it that this is a blatant load of lies? Prior to this I've flown with Malaysia a number of times and always had good service but this experience coupled with very poor seating on the A300 planes has now put me right off.,0
Two Business Class seats to and from Colombo. Outward was fine but the return leg from was very poor with no attention to our needs between lunch and dinner. Ringing the service bell had no effect. Eventually I had to walk to the service area to request tea where I found staff sitting and having a chat. Toilets weren't up to much either.,0
"Gatwick to Toronto. The airline cancelled my flight twice in light of covid19. It was fine. No problem. But, they withheld my payment and are only offering me rewards that i do not want. T They will not have my business again.",0
"I have booked a flight to Istanbul on 14th March via my travel agent..But due to the latest development of the Covic'19 crisis, we decide to pull out on 6th March and sent an appeal via our agent to postpone our trip to a future date. We didnt even request for a refund, we just requested to postpone to a future date when it is safer to travel .On 5th March 2020 a Turkish airline plane that landed in Singapore was found to carry a covic19 victim.. So we have every reason and right to protect ourselves and by not travelling to Turkey during this time of crisis. However our request has been turned down. The response from the Turkish airline has been very disappointing and irresponsible, no postponement is allowed. They should put the lives of customers above their self interest.",0
"They canceled the flight a day before departure, then refused to issue a refund, not once, but twice. Awful airline, avoid at all costs.",0
"Toronto to Los Angeles. At Toronto tI missed my flight due to insane lines and TSA idiocracy making wait in longer line. Once I got to my gate they told me it has been closed but it was delayed for an emergency but I couldn't enter the plane. At this point I'm too tired to argue with person at the desk so I just tell them to put me on the next flight to LA. The next flight came hours later it was a nice plane service was great. My major issue with this airline happened with the baggage delay and how they handled it. As of now, a day after I landed and my carry on didn't. I still haven't heard from the airline and was told I would have my belongings by 3pm it is now 6pm.",0
"Air Canada had always been at best a 3 star airline. Now since covid they don't rate even one star. Every flight has an issue. Waiting an hr for ground crew. Canceled. Delayed. As I write I'm sitting in Montreal at 10pm. Flight was scheduled for 8.30pm. 3 delays later they now tell us they ""just"" discovered a mechanical problem and the planed needs to be changed. How inept can 1 airline be? Jeez. You'd think Trudeau was the one running it.",0
"Delayed departure resulted in our seats on a connecting flight being resold to other passengers and an involuntarily rebooking on a flight leaving the following day. The airline offered no compensation, hotel voucher or apology. Poor and unacceptable customer service.",0
Stansted to Antalya via Istanbul. This was our first time flying with Atlasglobal and were pleasantly surprised. The seats were comfortable and we ordered special meals for our group of 10 and on both our flights we were provided these as requested. The meal quality was excellent and the choice of drinks was great also. On top of that they offer a luggage allowance of 30KG for free. Would definitely travel again with them.,1
Was delayed 2 hours. Made the passengers spend an hour inside the flight. There were pets on the flight. Poor things were agitated waiting for the flight to depart. They could have waited until the flight was ready to depart to board. Nickel and dime everyone for every single thing. Not a single apology from anyone for the delay.,0
"London to Denver. After flying BA and AA on this route I can safely say United Airlines is the worst airline. Certainly not the friendly skies! Food was poor. Aircrew were by comparison unattractive. Basically, after looking forward to flying on the Dreamliner, the way united have configured the plane and the service ruined my experience. Although leg room was fine, the seat width is dire. Also insisting on dimming the windows after lunch on a daytime flight with a daytime arrival at the destination is just plain dumb. If you have a choice, fly AA. I won't be choosing United for my next flight at all costs.",0
"Norwegian staff in Orly, Paris airport lied to our plane members multiple times regarding a canceled flight. They sent us an hour outside of Paris by bus to a hotel and told us a bus would pick us up for our flight but when we got there, the hotel staff said ""they booked you a room for tonight and have you leaving tomorrow"" after we had slept in the airport overnight. They refused to give us passengers any food when we hadn't eaten in 24 hours and slept in what looked like a refugee campsite with mini cots. Worst airline experience I've ever had. Norwegian, you treat people with no respect and very inhumanely.",0
Kansas City to Orlando. Worst airline ever! It's extremely overpriced for the luggage! It's ridiculous how much they charge for a carry on. I don't understand how this airline is still doing business as it's terrible! Even just for a tiny glass of water they charge a ton! Horrible!,0
3 years I haven't seen my sister. I only had 1 day in Melbourne I was able to see her. Jetstar then cancelled my flight at the last possible second and I'm not able to see her. Jetstar is the worst.,0
"I'm boarding a flight to Guam leaving at 10pm, arriving 4am. On an overnight flight how do the business class seats not go flat. Ridiculous. In future please advertise these seats as what they are, premium economy, not business. This kind of false advertising results in very tired and irritated customers.",0
"Orlando to Nashville via Chicago. Our flight from Orlando to chicago was delayed by about an hour and a half due to weather, which in return caused us to miss the connecting flight from chicago to nashville, which was fine, however the man we spoke to first and worked the gate next to the customer service area was rude told me I could not talk to a supervisor then told me he would call one, so he picked up the phone said nothing hung up and said one would be right there, never saw a supervisor, then as his shift was ending and i was still standing there he said 'did one come?' I said no he said ok have a nice drive home laughed and left. The customer service people weren't really wanting to help my family get home finally gave in and put us on a different airline. This is the worst airline to go through, if you can spend a little extra go through someone else unless you are into getting stranded.",0
"London to Tunis return. At the moment the only way to get to Tunisia is with Tunisair. We found most flight attendants to be very rude, and showed no interest in serving us. I asked for a cup of tea 5 times and was completely ignored. I tried to book a vegetarian meal without success and when I asked if they had a vegetarian meal was told curtly no! We have flown with them 4 times in six months and each time have found the service to be shocking. Staff should have customer care training as their attitude to work is dreadful!",0
"My experience couldn't have been better. Before boarding we used the Qatar Airways Lounge in Bangkok which is simply the best. Boarding was well organised. The crew were welcoming and the seat ready with pj's, blanket and seat cover. The Champagne was cold and the food was really good. I slept for 5 hours and had a light breakfast before arrival. What more could I have asked for?",1
On the 21st June I had a flight on Air Asia from Colombo to Kuala Lumpur. It was a red eye flight and we arrived around 5am in the morning. I had to clear customs although I had a flight on Air Asia in the evening. The time went very quickly so it must have been a good flight. I was able to stretch out and get some rest.,1
"Guangzhou to New York. Best Chinese airline in my opinion. I flew with China Southern on my round trip to China, and the staff is friendly and responsible. They also have free ramen noodles upon request.",1
"My husband and I recently flew Southwest Airlines coming home from a vacation trip. The Southwest Airlines steward, Lloyd, was so attentive and respectful. He offered walking and seat change assistance to an elderly woman on the plane. He also checked on all the passengers several times throughout the flight to make sure everyone was doing okay. Lloyd made the flight enjoyable and comfortable. I will definitely continue to fly with Southwest because of him.",1
"Flew Wizz Air from Bucharest to Dubai. Worst company I have ever flown with! Cabin crew were extremely rude. Leg room is tiny, toilets were dirty. Their website and app doesn't work properly.",0
"Atlanta to Chicago. Horrendous service at the ticket counter by an extremely rude employee. When filing a complaint, AA were not willing to provide a full reimbursement for our inconvenience nor did they apologize for the behavior of their employees. In other words, American Airlines does not treat their customers as the forefront of their company. As a frequent flyer, I will never fly American again.",0
My group of 9 people flew from Rome to Berlin with Easyjet. When we arrived at Berlin one of my big suitcase was not found. I reported to the lost and found at the airport and Easyjet online and tried to contact them via phone but they were hopeless and very frustrated is all I can say. 3 days later they found my suitcase in broken condition and most of the valuable stuff were stolen. They took no responsibility of my stolen goods. This made me sick when I think about this trip. Never put anything valuable in your suitcase when travel with Easyjet!,0
CZ3553 September 8th .The Service was punctual and staff pleasant. Very comfortable flat bed pod above average food quality. Price is rather competitive no problems flying CZ again in the future.,1
"Hong Kong to Adelaide. The flight was on time and smooth. The seat was spacious which I can stretch my leg fully though I am 6 feet tall. Really appreciate the meal service which provides a nice Thai style salad as the appetiser with a Malay curry chicken as main. Dessert was impressive, with cheese cakes and chocolate bars. Amenities Kit was also provided with branded body care products. Only pain point was the lacking of internet connectivity.",1
"I flew Hainan Airlines for the first time on a recent business trip from Toronto to Shanghai via Beijing, and the experience exceeded my expectations. The inflight service was exemplary on all legs of the trip and the ground transportation provided to and from the airports was easy to book and a very nice touch. The trip was excellent value and I'm glad I gave Hainan Airlines a try over the typical North American offerings. Only complaint was that the fare policies posted on the online booking service that I used was ambiguous about change fees, which was a headache solved by an inadvertent delay of an outbound flight. All airlines should make sure that their fare rules are accurately and clearly posted with agents that they use.",1
Toronto to Cancun. Been to Mexico so many times with different airlines but this has been the worst experience ever with Air Transat. I had the worst experience with the cabin crew as I was waiting for 2 hours to get a glass of water after asking so many times and got a bad attitude from the crew. I would never recommend this airline to anyone.,0
Southwest says at check in they are not responsible for damage to bags. I get to my destination and my bag was damaged. This isn't the first time... Coincidence? Handle with care Southwest. It's not rocket science. Your loading luggage. Don't be lazy.,0
"Lilongwe to London via Johannesburg. Wonderful airline to fly on, the aeroplane is in great condition with so many wonderful things available to the customer. Staff are very attentive and would make any other top class airline shy with how they ensure professional attention. Food is great and tasty. Seats are a little small but okay.",1
"Baltimore to Orlando. Spirit has constant flight delays, cancellations, and their check in booths are a complete mess. Spirit will delay and cancel their flights without a valid reason and their check in booths are always over flowing and with people trying to rebook their flights. Originally, I had planned to go on vacation for six days, but due to Spirits lacking system it was cut short to four days.  I wasted so much money on the unrefundable hotel and rental cars for the two days I missed due to Spirit canceling my flight. I understand that occasionally flights must be delayed due to weather however my flight was delayed four hours because the crew was not ready. This just goes to show that Spirit Airlines is poorly managed and has an inconsistent schedule. Overall, if you want to get to your destination on time and peacefully, then absolutely do not take Spirit Airlines.",0
"Las Vegas to Nashville. Before booking with Frontier I read the reviews. Most were negative. I decided to book anyway and I am glad I did. Our flight was not only on time but early arriving in Nashville. The check in was easy and everyone was friendly. Because I had researched I knew I needed to buy my seat, pay ahead for checked bags and bring my own snacks. Because of the great experience and the low prices I will be flying with Frontier again.",1
"Frontier and delays. Name a more iconic duo. The first time I flew Frontier a couple of years ago, there was a sudden 2.5 hour delay which they claim is due to climate reasons. Okay fair enough I excused it. Now the second time I decided to fly Frontier, there is another 2 hour delay. This has never happened to me on any other airline. No other airline has experienced as many delays as Frontier and I've only flown with them twice.",0
"Had the absolute worst experience with this airline. I took their 1 hr flight from Phuket to Bangkok, and it was delayed by an hour and a half. Because it arrived late, I missed my 2nd and 3rd flight. When I arrived to Bangkok everything was closed, so I had to wait 5 hrs for them to open in the morning. Thai VietJet Air sent me from one place, to another place, to another place. Nobody could help me, they were extremely rude. I was crying, in tears ""please help me get back home"" and they completely ignored me, avoided looking at me. I've never been so disrespected by an airline before. All they said is email the airline, but I'd have to wait 8 hrs total till they open. And even then, how long will it take to respond to my email? It was a disaster. They didn't take accountability for the delayed flight. I had to pay again. Why would I give them more money? Will I ever get reimbursed? Who knows. But they did not help me at all. Never using them again. They legit traumatized me.",0
Osaka to Bangkok. Very adequate service throughout for a budget airline. Food small portions but tasty. Plenty of toilets and room to walk about. Nice clean aircraft left a little late but arrived early.,1
"British Airways is taking reservations and then cancelling flights without giving any reasons. We had further plans that all needed to be cancelled because of the flights. BA did nothing to ease the process and offered absolutely no explanation of why the flight was cancelled, I am not going to travel on BA again and may not travel again this year at all.",0
I fly regularly between Amsterdam and Luton. Except during ash clouds and extreme weather the flights were punctual. Pity about the extra charge for credit card payment. Only train tickets to London via first capitol connect for sale in the plane pity as people are not aware that if they get in the wrong train they will have to pay again. Also other destinations eg Bedford not for sale in cabin. A shuttlebus to the railway station don't forget to buy your ticket for this in advance! Only plane tickets bought far in advance can be had for a reasonable price at the last minute very expensive. However this is a good airline if you are travelling to the Luton area London or using the railway service from Parkway. Overall I am a satisfied customer and would recommend easyjet.,1
"Ft Lauderdale to Port Au Prince. Completely traumatizing experience, checking in to boarding the Airplane was a horrible experience the attendant were very rude. This was my first and only time Traveling jetblue. I paid 497 For horrible customer service. While sitting on airplane I get an email that my flight was also delayed.",0
Chania to Athens. Be aware of this airline delays. I lost 1 day of my 4 days vacation due to their last minute delays. It's sad that during summer morning flights should be delayed.,0
I travelled from Sydney to Beijing then Beijing to UK on 2nd Jan 2014. The inflight entertainment was poor the TV screen was not working properly. Tea Coffee and juice was only offered at meal times. Water was offered twice. Even though the flight from Beijing to UK was in daylight hours I was ordered to put the blind down The seat belt sign was on the entire flight. All announcements where in very poor English and hard to hear.,0
My partner and I travelled with LAN from Australia to South America return and internally within South America on a LAN pass. I was so pleasantly surprised by the level of service and friendliness of the cabin crew. I had read prior to our trip mixed reviews so was somewhat apprehensive when it came time to travel. Past reviews couldn't have been more far of the mark! The cabin crew were really friendly. My partner is a very nervous flyer and on every leg we flew with them the cabin crew kept checking in on him to make sure he was okay. On our way home flying into Auckland we were told there was bad weather and one lovely cabin crew member even offered to sit by him as we landed. The food was nice and not too heavy and on the long haul sectors cabin crew were frequently up and down the aisle with drinks. The inflight entertainment system was fantastic and I would put it on par with Emirates ICE system! Any negatives? The only thing I could say is that the seats were a little uncomfortable but then being over 6 ft I get the same problem with other airlines. On the whole a most enjoyable experience.,1
"Houston to Tampa. Paid extra for extra wide seats and not only were they not available in row 2, but they sold the third seat in that row. Flight attendant was no help, and she stated ""oh sometimes they do that."" Spirit Airlines is refunding our money but that is not what we wanted. Bait and switch!",0
"Hyderabad to Bengaluru. SpiceJet just got my heart from check in counters to in air, cabin crew were so courteous and helpful. Kudos to the beautiful girls on board fully covered from top to bottom yet so presentable. Hope to fly with you soon SpiceJet.",1
"Phoenix to Cedar Rapids via Denver. Staff at Denver airport extremely helpful and friendly. My partner and I were concerned at first because we were flying basic economy and did not have a seat number assigned to us on our United app boarding pass. We asked if we indeed had seats and she confirmed that we did though they were on separate ends of the plane. We were just thrilled to have seats and to be getting home on time. After a while, she came up to us with two new boarding passes that seated us side by side. Staff truly went the extra mile.",1
"Lombok to Surabaya. By far the worst airline I've ever encountered. The person checking us in didn't even look at us, she was too busy flirting with someone else. Just unbelievably bad service. Previous times I've flown Lion air have been equally as bad. Terrible customer service and the flights are nearly almost always late. I will never be flying with them again.",0
Luton to Bucharest. Very unprofessional staff at the airport. I paid extra for priority boarding but ended up among the last people to board the plane. They lost my luggage last December and haven't heard back from them since. Their call centre is a joke. The person assigned to deal with my claim doesn't even reply to my emails. It's worth paying a bit extra and fly with a decent company that has some respect for their passengers.,0
"Toronto to Munich via Keflavik. Absolutely terrible. They sigificantly overbooked the flight. More importantly, they offered no information about options except a phone number that put you on hold for 30 minutes. After finally getting through, you are speaking with a call centre in India that had no information about the flight. Customer experience was all downhill from there. Worst experience ever. I will never fly with them again. One star is too many for a flight that never happened.",0
"Never, ever again. Packed in. No covid distancing. Disgraceful. Full flight. A super spreader possibility. I heartily suggest you do no choose this carrier.",0
"Extremely dissatisfied with the Customer Service Relations team. Due to unforeseen and unavoidable circumstance, my flight from Mumbai to London Heathrow was cancelled and hence I wanted to cancel my flight from Tuticorin to Mumbai. I had requested via email to honour and waive the cancellation charges but to no avail. It would have been a gesture of goodwill to waive the charges at least a certain amount and not half the ticket price.",0
"Nice flight with Royal Air Maroc from Spain to Morocco. Aircraft was clean, leg space very good. Food and all type of drinks were included. First service very fast and later on attentive on request. An airline to be recommended.",1
"I've always wanted to fly on a Dreamliner, and LAN Airlines was the cheapest option for me flying from Madrid to Frankfurt. I had done research prior to booking and had high expectations of LAN. They did not disappoint. Boarding was very efficient and we departed 5 minutes behind schedule which wasn't a big issue for me. The IFE is the best I have used. The cabin was airy and you can tell this as soon as you step on board. The crew were very friendly and welcoming. The complimentary snack service was a bonus. A ham roll and a chocolate bar as well as a drink. The seat was comfortable, although I had a slight issue with the back rest. I would highly recommend LAN Airlines.",1
Bucharest to Tel Aviv. Worst airline in the globe. Only one check in desk for 230 passengers. They had us waiting outside the aircraft in the freezing weather for their maintenance problem.,0
Los Angeles to Buffalo via Chicago. I purchased my tickets several months ago specifically to get advanced seating because I am 320 pounds. My flight was changed going back from LAX to BUF. My assigned seating was taken away and currently I cannot assign a seat to myself for the changed flight. I called customer service about this issue and they could not help. This is the worst service ever. I will never use United ever again.,0
Air hostess has done wonderful efforts by providing right service in providing snacks at appropriate time. The options she had provided is wonderful and appreciable. Kudos to spicejet for such crew member.,1
"Rome to Comiso. We were booked since March. We got to Rome June 6 and we were scheduled to go to Sicily via Comiso on June 8. On June 6 at 10 in the evening we received a message that flight was cancelled. No explanation. So obviously we panicked and had to rebook right there and then which cost us way more. They offered a refund. So i filled up the  refund application. That was June, its August and they haven't refunded us. They make it impossible for you to contact them! They keep claiming they have refunded us but we never got this. This airline charges so little but don't be fooled they are rude and have not refunded us!!",0
"Customer service very disappointing. It takes already more than 3 months to get a refund. Every time I call the customer service they tell me some other excuse, after I waited 30 minutes in line. One would expect a better organisation for such a big company. Next time other airline!",0
The third time I used Kuwait Airways to travel from New York to Mumbai. I had a very poor experience. I had a flight change in Kuwait. On both flights my seat would not work and I had to sit upright for the entire trip. To make things worse the TV did not work either. I would not recommend this airline if you have other options.,0
"London to Thessaloniki via Istanbul. I would recommend to anyone who can avoid this airline to do so by all means. I cannot find words to describe their ""customer service"" and should anything go wrong during the trip you are left alone. Between booking and flying, TK changed the aircraft type and a flight time without informing me at all. I flew from LHR to IST and then my flight from IST to SKG was cancelled. It took me 2.5 hours at the transfer desk and stories I cannot even describe to get a ticket to return back to London as there was no other flight to my destination until the day after. I had a business class ticket, however when I went to the gate I was told they had overbooked the business class cabin and I would have to be downgraded to economy. Overall, I spent 34 hours without sleep only to return where I left from, without ever reaching my destination. And now several days later, I still haven't received a refund for my tickets. Avoid this airline and fly with one that knows how to treat customers.",0
"Colombo to Kuala Lumpur. A warm and culture influenced welcome by the crew. Cabin crew very hospitable and engaging. Take off was pretty smoothie. The only negative was the aircraft itself that was quite crampy. As it was a night flight the expectation of a really good meal wasn't the at high, but flavour and the choice of meal pleased  me. The cabin lights were  off shortly after service for a comfortable and well needed sleep. Seats were quite comfortable. Overall an exquisite journey. Looking forward to fly again.",1
"This airline is extremely inefficient and ineffective. Out of four flights taken in the last 3 days, only one was on time. The others were delayed by an hour or more. For one of them, online it said our plane was arriving from Chicago, the phone representative said it was coming from Los Angeles, and the gate attendant said it arrived from Montego Bay. It was delayed over an hour. Our plane from Charlotte to Myrtle Beach on June 29th at on the runway for an hour before turning back to the gate to replace a radio. Overall an extreme disappointment. I do not intend to fly this airline again nor recommend it.",0
"Twice I've flown Ukraine International on the route Kharkiv to Amsterdam via Kiev, and two times they managed to have technical problems that resulted in cancellation of the flight. First off, they try to scam you by putting it down as delayed, probably to avoid compensation or something. We had to stay the night in a hotel, in order to make our replacing flight, but they did not provide us any form of compensation, aside from a horrible meal. Crew are not willing to provide information and try to send you off without actually trying to help you. The worst airline I flew with.",0
Absolutely terrible airline like riding a ragged city bus in the sky. Uncomfortable seats no leg room and rattled more than any other plane I've experienced. Extra fees everywhere. We booked a month in advance and were told they could not check us in because cut off had passed by 2 minutes after they had us standing in line for over 20 minutes. We had to wait 6 six hours for another flight. Ft. Lauderdale Airport is some what responsible as well their facility is a disaster. Spend a little extra and go with an airline that doesn't have hidden fees and pathetic customer service at every turn. They will never get another penny from our family.,0
San Francisco to Glasgow via Keflavik. They gave me the wrong meal on the first leg of my flight. Then when I got to my destination my bag did not arrive along with about 6 other people. I called every day and never got an update on where my bag was or when it would be delivered. I never got an apology or anything better for losing my bag and all my stuff and forcing me to spend time I didn't have shopping for basic clothing to make it through a work trip. Not recommended.,0
Dusseldorf to Munich booked for November 2019. Have tried for three days to get someone on the phone and I've been on hold for 1 hour each time. Never reached anyone. I sent an email and never got an answer.,0
Sep 25 to fly from Houston to Istanbul. We had about a 20 minute delay but we arrived on time to Istanbul. We flew using Economy and our legs were pretty cramped in there because the guy in front of us who had an exit row leaned his seat back. The food was good and also the movies they had for us to watch were fine. On the flight from Istanbul to Berlin there is a 3 hour flight and once again we are provided with food and movies. This flight is fine. On the return flight on Oct 2 going from Berlin to Istanbul was fine they served breakfast on this flight but no TV was in our seat but that was fine because we were exhausted anyway and just slept. Once we arrived at Istanbul our flight to Houston was on time as far as us getting on the plane however we then had complications. There was a 3 hour delay while on the plane before we took off. We sat in exit row this time with comfortable leg room. Our flight landed about 3 hours late but I was ok with it because it was my final destination.,1
"Portland to New York JFK. One of the worst experiences ever with JetBlue and will never use them again. Was trying to be New York by December 7th. When I bought the ticket the of departure was December 7th it state the arrival time but never told me the date of arrival. It confused me at first so I called them to confirm the date of arrival which was December 8th, I needed December 7th. When I tried to switch the date they told me I had to pay the cancellation fee.",0
I recently flew from Toronto to Moncton with my two small children. I unfortunately missed my flight by two minutes! It was my fault as we got lost in the airport and were not watching the time carefully. We were escorted to the service desk and the attendants were so nice to us. They saw how distraught I was because I thought I would have to pay for three additional flights but instead they gave us at no charge three free flights for the next day. I will definitely fly with Westjet on future flights.,1
Emirates A380 is the only way to fly long distance today. We flew from Spain to Dubai and back on it and once you experience the bar at the back and being able to move around drink chat and socialize you will not want to fly any other way than the A380 Emirates Business Class. It sets a standard of luxury that no other aircraft or airline can compete with. They know the meaning of going that extra mile and the A380 is it!,1
I want to put my hands together for the UA employee Victoria Jones at O'Hare. She helped me fill out the COVID form online mandatory to fly to Spain. I would have never made it without her. Kudos for Victoria! We need more helpful people at the airport.,1
Excellent service. I flew to Nashville from Montana round trip I have no complaints that's over 4 thousand miles with frontier. We had a delay in Denver but that will happen with all the top notch planes as well.,1
Melbourne to Cairns 7th July. 12 hour delay due to a bird strike. Exactly one week to the day we are currently grounded at Cairns for at least 6 hours due to a bird strike. Call me cynical but how coincidental is that. Just an excuse used by Tigerair me thinks. Will never fly with them again and I don't recommend you using them either.,0
"Our American Airlines flight from Manchester to JFK was delayed by over 3.5 hours with no explanation. When I looked into the history of this route, this daily flight has not departed on time even once in the last 28 days. The flight itself was okay once we got going, but really departing and arriving on time is pretty fundamental to how highly an airline can be rated.",0
JU 311 12 Dec and JU 314 to Paris on 15 Dec. Friendly and professional crew very comfortable seats plenty of leg room stylish pillows and blankets excellent selection of wine and drinks and delicious meal. When the flight attendant handed me the menu I thought there must be a fee attached. I got a hot meal free. Excellent experience. On a way back was the same. I came to Belgrade airport ground support staff were smiling professional and accommodating. On the flight back the same good service and experience. Have just bought another ticket with Air Serbia to Thessaloniki!,1
"Marrakech to London via Lisbon. I have flown with many airlines including budget airlines such as Easyjet and Ryanair and I have not had such a bad experienced as I had with TAP Portugul. I arrived at the checkin desk in Marrakech to be told that I could not take the flight because it was overbooked. Meaning my seat, which I had already paid for was sold to someone else! I was told that I can board the flight if there was any seats available. So they made me wait and told me that there was one seat available half an hour before departure. So I was rushed to the aircraft last minute before it took off. I then arrived in London to discover that my luggage was left in Marrakech! I am still waiting for them to get my luggage to me, which I don't have any hope of. Apart from this bad experience I have to say that they only offer their passangers a cheap turkey sandwich, so if you're vegetarian you can just starve as they don't even sell any food onboard. Not to mention that there is hardly any leg room. I don't understand how this airline can be part of the Star Alliance. Absolutely terrible, stay away at all costs.",0
Las Vegas to Denver. Make you pay for a carry on. On top they make you pay for a seat after you already bought the fight. Can it seems to be a pattern with them if there's always something or on whether they don't have a cleaning crew at the gate or security isn't here to clear the plane or a pilot is missing. Because of there miss takes I've miss 3 connecting flight. Hate this airline will never use them again.,0
"I will use United  for my next trip. We have family trip and got cancelled, so i called United and ask them to help me to cancel my flight. The agent that i spoke to was very nice and I ask him to tranfer me to his supervisor. Erica is the supervisor i spoke too and i explain to her my situation she was very patient to hear what i have to say, very calm, nice and very helpful. I was happy that they both helped me and solve my problem.",1
"WestJet has gone downhill. They now charge fees for changing seats within the 24 hrs before departure. They have been at least two hours late on every leg of the trip. The staff are not as helpful as they use to be. It took more than 24 hours to go from London UK to Halifax, Canada. There are plenty of choices from Toronto to Europe. I recommend taking another airline. WestJet may be good on short trips within Canada and not recommended for Canada to Europe.",0
"I purchased a ticket in November 2020 that had no COVID restrictions for transiting in Moscow, there is no policy for COVID testing when you transit Moscow. We were denied boarding for no COVID test, tho our destination, Turkey does not require any. We were denied boarding after being checked in, luggage tagged, boarding passes issued. Manager did not agree to ticket refund, tho it is a refundable ticket.",0
London to Colombo return. The new A340 seats were fantastic flat beds with First Class cabin offered at Business Class fare. I had an excellent flight and we landed 45 mins early.,1
"Shanghai to Toronto. A very nice experience with nice cabin environment. The staff was patient and helpful, they provided three meals include Wine and many kinds of bread .The lounge in Shanghai is one of the best I have experienced and it's new! The leg room is wider than United Airlines and Air Canada.",1
Flew LAX to PHL with Virgin America for first time. Was very pleasantly surprised at how comfortable the flight was. I was not expecting Virgin to be such a great airline to fly with. I came equipped with plenty to entertain myself for these flights and found that I was not checking the time and waiting impatiently for arrival since I was comfortable and there was plenty to hold my attention with TV and WiFi. I always look for most economical flights and am disappointed when Virgin America is not one of them. I will fly Virgin to FT Lauderdale from LA this June and very happy about this. They will be my first choice from now on.,1
"London to Hong Kong via Stockholm. After multiples flights and horrible experiences with several SAS staff and no food or water, we arrived at our final destination with nearly 11hrs of accumulated delay, only to be told 'Sorry'! They did not even bother asking us what the impact of this had been at our end. I missed the  key business meeting for which I was making that trip to Hong Kong while my partner missed a family member who was in Hong Kong for just a few hours before flying back to the US. They have not seen each others in over 2 years! SAS customer care team responses following the incident were in complete disregard of the most basic standards of customer service and reach a level of unprofessionalism that I have not seen in a very long time.",0
Philadelphia to Charlotte. Frontier might have delays but prices are great! The prices made it affordable and not breakable to see my family up north when i want to. This is the first time flying with them and I didn't miss the high prices for a cup of soda and some pretzels or cookies.,1
Hyderabad to Brussels via London. Didn't expect this from British Airways. For me quality hit the rock bottom. Especially the unclean flight. I would have preferred the aircraft from Brussels to London and vice versa for the long haul travel. Maybe my expectations was too high but considering the price I paid for ticket I think it's not worth it. Other airline which I used to travel had the same price and if I compare the services of that ariline I regret choosing British Airways.,0
"Manila to Hong Kong, Seat 63H, last section of the plane. Flight was delayed for 2 hours due to heavy rains. Good there was IFE in the flight and all the passengers did not get bored. I hope PAL will use the same planes for the Middle East flights. Anyway, the flight was a little turbulent due to heavy clouds, seat was good and near the rear lavatory. Food was ok for a short flight.",1
"The airline services are pathetic, they don't pay heed to their customers preferences. Regular rescheduling if flights keep us on hooks. And no customer care services at the very least they can do. Changing flight status cost us extra charges.",0
We travelled from Melbourne to Singapore yesterday. Purchased flights approx 5 months ago on a special. We had seats 1 J and K which are bulk head seats. We have travelled business class with Emirates and were never under the assumption that we were going to get the same level with Jetstar. Some fellow passengers were disappointed with the service but they had much higher expectations. We would defiantly fly Star Class again and I think for the extra it represents good value especially if you can purchase during a sale.,1
"Bangkok to Brussels via Abu Dhabi. Due to the Corona crises they cancelled a ton of flights. They did not offer any alternative and warned only two days before departure. Instead of offering a full refund, they give you Etihad credit or cancellation with some cost. Also it is impossible to reach and when you get through you can hardly understand the operator. They only care about their dollars. Big minus.",0
"Boarding in a slaughterhouse queue in terminal 2, chaotic boarding, almost at a standstill at the front door of the plane, impassable corridor, no agility. In my seat was a lady who took the liberty of sitting there and pretended not to know her seat so that she could sit next to what I assume was her companion. When the flight attendant was called, she soon revealed her seat, but now the aisle was jammed and it was impossible to go to the front, so I sat in the seat that was possible, next to an individual who spent the whole flight bothering me and despite having a vacant seat by the window.",0
After going to an American Airlines counter at DFW to ask a simple question about my bag I was shocked to see how fast everyone wanted to pass the buck. I always thought Air Canada was bad but the staff at DFW with American airlines was awful. The flight attendants were rude onboard and the service was non existent. Will not be flying American again!,0
"Istanbul to London. Horrendous airline and horrendous staff at the business class lounge. My husband was flying business to another country, he went in and I waited outside for him. Was told to move from the disabled seat outside of the lounge even though my son is disabled. And the guy was abusive and rude. Looked my son up and down and asked where was his wheelchair. The discrimination that Turkish people have against English and disabled children is disgusting. Would never travel with them. Ask a simple question and get laughed at.",0
"This was one of my worst airline experiences. After delaying my flight out of LGW by 4 hours and being promised by customer service agents that it would not be a problem and they would figure out an easy solution for me when I arrived in KEF, they delayed my connection, but not enough for me to make my flight. There were only a couple other flights going to the US the rest of the night that were already overbooked because they had done the same thing to another flight that day. My only option was to be put in a hotel and take a flight 24 hours later. After finally arriving to the hotel I was supposed to stay in, the hotel informed us that they had run out of rooms and would transport us to a separate hotel. Not one Icelandair employee apologized or admitted that maybe they should not have reassured me many times that everything would be fine and I would be able to continue on to my final destination.",0
"Las Palmas to Nurnberg. We flew Corendon for the first time and never again! The flight took 4.5 hours and you get nothing at all, so take everything from home or buy at the airport. We changed our departure time during the holiday so we had to pay extra money to park our car. Communication with Corendon, horror and horror! They are cheap, but that's it.",0
"Brindisi to London Gatwick with easyJet. Good experience. The app is good for the pass, boarding easy and priority correctly applied. Very nice crew, both flight deck and cabin. A little late due to slow baggage loading. Air bridge at Gatwick much appreciated due to weather. All good.",1
Flew Brisbane to Singapore on 14th March sitting in row 57. The service was first class the flight supervisor remembering details of passengers and while remaining professional communicated with a sense of humour and friendliness. The food was as good as any restaurant with good size portions. Inflight entertainment was first class plenty of choice for everyone to keep occupied.,1
I've traveled a lot of times to London from New Delhi via Doha and have always enjoyed my experience. The food is good. The entertainment systems provide a varsity of options. The window seats in economy can be a bit inconvenient as there's some plane's equipment under every window seat.,1
"We have absolutely no complaints and would fly with them again. We did not encounter any delays, cancellations, and hidden fees like other reviews stated. Having said that Allegiant only flys the Pittsburgh to Myrtle Beach route seasonally. I don't know if that's possibly why we did not encounter any problems. As far as the free personal item that can be carried on and worrying with measurements I didn't even see any employee even concerning themselves with measuring anything that was carried on. ",1
"I have flown twice with Porter since December. I found the website easy to use. In December, I found the prices reasonable as I booked very late after the death of my sister just before Christmas. Inflight snacks were tasty and different and my beverage was served in a glass. My family flew to Ottawa in early August. Security was very sensitive and polite as we traveled with an urn. Online booking was easy and I used both one way options and return with price very reasonable. Flights were smooth. Seat was comfortable. Adequate space as bag with urns easily fit under seat close by. Nice option to cabin check larger bag. Lounge in Toronto and Ottawa is very comfortable with free coffee, cookies and Internet. I wish Porter flew into more cities. I appreciated the service given by Porter.",1
