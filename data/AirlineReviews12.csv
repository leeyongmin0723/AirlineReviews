Aero Vip carries out the public service obligation connection between Funchal and the smaller Porto Santo airport located on the island with the same name.

In both cases the safety briefing was carried out by the first officer himself, as the plane does not have any FA on board.

The plane on the way back arrived late and we left PXO with some 30 minutes of delay, again reaching our destination in slight over 10 minutes. The planes’ interiors are quite worn out but overall the planes gave me the impression of being in a good mechanical shape.

The flight to Munich was full of people from the original canceled flight to Prague, who subsequently wanted to continue to Prague. Although the Adria Airways staff were present at the airport, no one came to inform the passengers and the result was tremendous confusion and lack of information. Ljubljana airport servicing staff finally informed us that Adria Airways staff refused to come! Also wasn't possible to call the Adria Airways hotline. Maybe it had been overloaded due to the number of disgruntled passengers because the next gate was full of people waiting for a delayed flight to Vienna, where there also wasn't anybody from Adria Airways who could provide any information. Unfortunately this flight left without us and we were all forced to ride from the Munich airport to a more than 30 km distant hotel and the next morning at 6am again back.

ATR-72,Adria Airways,Economy Class,September 2017,5th December 2017,0,1,1,UnitedStates,3,no,"Ljubljana to Vienna. Overall, the flight services of Adria are those of an average, reliable, small European carrier. I have flown them many times over the years, and I have seldom experienced any problems with the flights themselves. Returning to Vienna from a visit to Albania and Slovenia in September, however, I had an encounter with Adria that has revealed just how much their customer service quality could be improved. Adria offers opportunities to purchase business class upgrades or empty economy class seats through Optiontown. Business class upgrades on Adria are a joke because you're paying at least 50EUR for an empty seat next to you and a snack. The option to purchase an empty economy class seat at 19EUR is a great deal though, in my opinion. Having selected this option for my LJU-VIE flight, I received a confirmation that my transaction had cleared and the extra seat had been assigned next to me. Fast forward to the actual flight: there had been an aircraft change from the CRJ-900 to an ATR-72 (Darwin Airlines/Etihad Regional), but I still had my empty seat. The ATR-72 has two seats that face towards the rear of the plane at the front of the cabin, and one of the women seated there was scared to fly backwards, so the flight attendant unilaterally reassigned her to my empty seat without asking. It's a short flight, and I didn't want to cause a scene, so I just let it all happen assuming I could easily get a refund for my 20EUR transaction. It took exactly one month for Adria's customer service team to respond to me, and they said that my ""business class upgrade"" had not cleared, so I was not charged. I had never requested a business class upgrade, and I was charged for the empty seat I had in fact requested, so I sent all of the relevant receipts and statements back to Adria. Three weeks later, I still have yet to receive a response, so I simply disputed the charge with my credit card company that was easily able to understand the issue and refunded the money. 3-4 weeks+ response time from customer service is absolutely embarrassing, and Adria should be ashamed of their operations.

Adria Airways as the national carrier pretty much holds a monopoly in this market and even those few carriers who had flown limited scheduled routes into the Slovenian capital, Air France and Swiss, have regretfully withdrawn their services.

There is nothing appealing about Adria's offering and what incentive do they have to lift their standard when there is no competition to stimulate improvement? The entire fleet is tired and outdated. The business class product is non existent, staff are at best disinterested, leaning towards unfriendly. And what's with those announcements? They are completely impossible to understand, not just in English and German but also in Slovenian. If not having flown as often as I have to know what the announcements are about, there is no hope in hell that a normal person can understand the dribble that comes over the PA. Guess how many uninformed passengers does that make for? If one is not fluent in a language, and heavily accented, then one must slow down so others can hopefully understand you. But what's their excuse of not pronouncing Slovenian correctly. Everything is executed at such a speed so they can place a tick against that task, yet no care is invested to make sure the task is executed effectively. ! Pick up your game or your end will come one day when monopoly is broken (look around the world to learn from other such stories).  I have found a solution to avoid flying Adria Airways where possible - Turkish Airlines presence is now pretty strong in LJU and I can't fault their service. Whenever flying into LJU from a geographical destination where IST is a logical place to transit, TK is my carrier of choice.",MUC to LJU,1,1,adria-airways,fleet is tired and outdated,Solo Leisure,,1,0,c09e057a-20d6-4732-bb62-c6464605d4d3
CRJ-900,Adria Airways,Economy Class,October 2016,10th October 2016,2,1,2,Netherlands,3,no,"✅ , |  Ljubljana to Amsterdam. First experience with Adria Airways was underwhelming and unimpressive. Flight sat on tarmac fully boarded for 20 minutes without explanation; causing 20 minute delay on arrival without comment from crew and despite many passengers with tight connections in AMS. Crew was the least personal I've experienced in my 30+ flights in 2016. The crew quickly passed through the cabin holding a large bottle of water but without offering it; everything else is buy-on-board at unappealing prices. Aging CRJ-900 showed its wear, limited on-air entertainment, but able to select bulkhead seat at check-in so legroom was good. Compared to inbound flight on Air France, Adria lacked any sort of the polished, personal touch that its in-flight magazine claims it wants to project. To LJU, however, the options are few and the schedules erratic, so Adria will often be the only rational choice for many sectors.",LJU to AMS,3,1,adria-airways,underwhelming and unimpressive,Solo Leisure,,2,0,7d597a9f-0578-4892-8825-47bbde83d25a

I hate that they never board on time neither depart on time. For 20 pax you should be in the air in about 15 min. But they lose a lot of time after the boarding is completed and the take off. The service is worse every time. Now you get a small pack of seeds or dry fruit and a bottle of water. The flights are normally only 30 mins but nevertheless I miss the nice box with good sandwich water and a small dessert. The price is well overpriced for what they offer.

So by the time I landed at Mexico City, got off the plane, got my luggage and got to the ticket counter of Aeromexico, my next flight was taking off towards Los Angeles. I thought that Aeromexico / Delta would just put me on the next flight. First, they made me visit different ticket counters which took another 45 minutes and at the end said that they couldn't do anything about it and I would have to buy a whole new ticket. The first ticket that I bought online cost me about $125 usd, but now this new ticket to LA cost me almost $300 usd. After I bought my ticket, went to the Aeromar ticket counter, which was in total disarray, and tried to talk with the supervisor. He gave me an email to write to and sent me on my way. Since then I wrote them twice and have received discouraging emails. Yesterday it took me two hours on the phone with them, going through 3 levels of management for them to give me a ""courtesy flight"" worth $80 usd and I still have to pay the tax. I ask them what would of happened if my whole family was with me, we would have spent $3,000 usd? He said that there is nothing that they could do, so much for customer service. So that is why I think I will never fly with them again.  In the old days we had no choice, but now there are 3 more airlines here in Puerto.

Judging by the low number of people that went to the passenger service counter I think the reason for cancellation may have been more economic than technical.

This airline tries hard to fill the gap left by the collapse of Aero Lloyd Boliviano but is still plagued by constant changes to schedules usually because the aircraft flying the international route (Brazil) is late in arriving in Santa Cruz and therefore delays the local flights. It also tends to overbook flights and then moves confirmed ticket holders to later flights (it is really important to reconfirm flights) and will even change flight schedules back in time so flights depart 2 hours earlier then scheduled.

My premium economy flight from Kumasi to Accra was delayed by 2 hours after checking in but nobody from the airline told us any reason. All the passengers were crowded into a small area with no social distancing as if there was no pandemic happening. When we finally boarded the flight, the hostess was constantly removing her nose mask to flirt with some politician in the front seat. I asked her for a cup of coffee and was refused because she said only water is allowed due to COVID. For the extra price that we are paying for premium economy and the number of hours that they hold us hostage we deserve better! The seat was dirty and the armrest plastic was chipped, while the signs on the ancient noisy plane were all in Chinese. You could feel the plane shaking the whole time during the flight which makes you wonder if they even do proper maintenance. We finally reached our destination nearly 3 hours late but my baggage did not arrive. There were people from earlier flights also waiting there for their bags so this seems to be a very common thing. The airport staff were rude and told us to wait and maybe our bags would come, maybe not.

There was no notice from the airline, we received the email after we were told that it was cancelled. The customer service response was not professional. When asked for why it was cancelled, we were notified that it was a technical problem which is surprising that 4-hours before the flight, only then did they think about confirming a cancelled flight. Normally, airlines would provide compensation to make sure the customer is not inconvenienced. Their first question was, ""do you have a place to stay here in Ghana?"" This of course should not be the first question to ask a customer who is not from the country. Had it not been for the collective anger and frustration of all passengers on the original flight, there would not have been any quick movement to get us on another flight. Even though it is a small airline or growing airline, the experience was more frustrating for us as a customer. Lastly, the manager or person in charge of transferring us to another flight did not care enough to get our contact information to notify us that we had successfully been transferred to another flight. Instead, when we happened to pass by again he looked at us surprised saying ""Why are you here? You should be checking in right now at the other airline!"".

It was also good not to have the flight constantly interrupted by announcements of one kind or another in three different languages as seems to be the trend these days. Tripoli airport isn't a pleasure but no worse than you would expect and every landing seemed calmer than I am used to on the bigger planes. Two big faults though: firstly we had to turn the plane around for a sick passenger and no one made any announcement until about 5 seconds before landing which made most of us think we had turned around for a plane fault. Secondly on the outward flight my bags arrived two days late. Not a disaster for me but certainly it could have been for some people. No apology no attempt to trace me when the bag arrived (though they said they were just about to). Also only 3 movies for 26 hours of flying.

A couple of days later the original return flight was totally cancelled. I was later offered in return another ticket two days earlier or full refund. Upon choosing the full refund I got back less than 40% of my paid amount for this trip and the argument was that they only full refund the return ticket that was changed and the outbound ticked is non refundable.

The Austral flights were actually better - the Embraer planes are more comfortable and roomy than Aerolineas Argentinas 737s (which looked new but were a bit cramped) and the Embraer seats even have small entertainment screens (can be hard to get earphones though).

I was always a little annoyed with them. I waited on the phone for 30 minutes the day before my flight to reserve seats for the flights and when I showed up to the airport they had no record of my phone call (even though I had gotten an email with seat confirmation) and they had already given away our seats. Given that we had an international flight on our itinerary, we were entitled to two checked bags for each of our flight legs, and every single time they tried to charge us and we had to remind them that we got two free bags - I think they were trying to dupe us. What was most frustrating was that they cancelled our flight home with just over 24 hours advance notice because of a ""technical difficulty"" with the plane, and instead of having the direct flight from Buenos Aires to JFK that we paid for, they re-booked us (after 1 hour on hold) on a flight to New Jersey. I had a connection from JFK to Boston that I obviously missed, and ended up having to pay for another very expensive flight. I filed a claim and never heard back. I called once to follow up and after 45 minutes on hold I was promised that all claims were addressed within 22 days. 22 days came and went and I never heard back again. I made four additional follow-up phone calls, and each time I was on hold from anywhere from 10 to 45 minutes before I could speak to someone. Every person I spoke to gave a different explanation - from this is the wrong phone number to claims take 2 months (not 22 days) to call Expedia. When I finally started asking to speak to supervisors, two times I was actually hung up on.

Rio de Janeiro to Buenos Aires (Aeroparque): Aircraft used was a fairly new Boeing 737-800, flight was on time, crew was friendly, decent leg room and the food provided to us was very good (nice sandwich with a traditional argentine alfajor cake) and a good choice of beverages.

Worried about what may be next, I arrived at the airport two hours before departure, to find a nearly empty check-in line. So far, so good! Boarding took place relatively easily, bearing in mind we're in Argentina although by a single bus for a full B-737.

I was not sure what to expect, because reviews are very mixed. Both stretches were flown on their A340. On the outbound route, the seats were very old/outdated, although reasonably comfortable. The in-flight system was very limited with just 4 movies and not the best. On the inbound flight we had a different plane and the seats looked much better, although overall they were the same type, but the video screens were much larger. There was also a bigger choice in movies. On both flights the cabin crew was very attentive and pleasant. The meals, although quite abundant, were mediocre in taste, and in both cases, something or the other was forgotten (like the dressing). Bread was cold and/or stale. My biggest point of criticism was the check-in. I had a carry-on weighing 12.3 kilos. First at the counter in Bogotá they made a big fuss over size, but this particular TUMI bag does fit maximum accepted standards. They insisted I fit it in the thing to measure it and when they saw for themselves it did meet size requirements, they insisted to weigh it and told me to either take out the 2.3 kilos or have it checked. This when on Copa and Avianca they let me take it in on board in Economy, no questions asked, and this was business! On the inbound flight they had 3 counters in Buenos Aires with SkyPriority signs, but all 3 were unstaffed. The last check-in agent just walked away with leaving passengers in the SkyPriority line without saying anything. When I complained to the girl who did check me in at an economy counter, she said I had arrived just during a schedule change (how weird!). All in all it was a mixed bag with the actual flight a much better experience than the experience on the ground. To me their way of dealing with business class passenger in the check-in procedure leave much (!) to be desired. They did not treat us special, on the contrary.

I am 5'5 and was also uncomfortable. It was a long flight almost 9 hours and the TV screens did not function properly. Mine had no image whatsoever. My husband's screen had image but no sound. No entertainment at all for almost 9 hours is ridiculous. We had to take a second flight from Buenos Aires to Bahia Blanca and the flight was delayed 2 hours. On our return from Buenos Aires to Miami the flight was also delayed this time for 1 hour. Even tough the prices of Aerolineas Argentinas are lower I would never use it again or recommended to anybody. I have taken the same flight route with American Airlines and LAN and they are much better. Next time I rather pay more for the tickets and have a more pleasant and comfortable flight.,,1,2,aerolineas-argentinas,Aerolineas Argentinas customer review,,,2,0,ea01aa25-7bba-4f3e-9f92-54bd5d5f5125

Well I'm happy to report that with Aerolineas Argentinas you don't ""get what you pay for"" you get much more. The plane we took was an elderly Airbus that was a bit tattered (especially the bathrooms) but the seats were lie-flat and comfortable the food was above average (much better than American) and the flight attendants were cheerful professional and happy to help with a smile unlike the surly overweight lazy tenured FAs on most U.S. legacy carriers.

,Aerolineas Argentinas,Business Class,,14th January 2015,4,5,0,UnitedStates,8,yes,December 22nd 2014. MSP-JFK-EZE-FTE. Flew Club Condor. Others in our party of 5 flew coach. We had the full Monty flying Aerolineas. But the staff handled us well. Flight out left on time but no accommodations for Sky Priority passengers. Charge the gate at JFK was more like it. The food was very good. Service is prompt in that every flight attendant worked to get the job done so they could disappear. We liked how they gave us 3 options for our meals. The ice cream for desert and/or cheese plate were fantastic. And it is true they don't offer mixed drinks. For water they gave us a bottle for the over night flight. Breakfast was again very prompt well presented and the crew when prompted did go the extra step. On the return our child's vegetarian meal was missing. The crew promptly reviewed the menu and told us additional items we could choose from. For the return our flight was changed to add a stop at BRC. At which time we were notified our return to JFK was delayed from 11 pm to 6 am. Sky Priority line did nothing to help us here. We had to suffer with the rest. However they did rebook our last segment with Delta for us and effectively communicated to the crew in JFK to assist us and they did! They offered us a hotel and dinner in EZE. As we missed our JFK connection back to MSP they put us up in NYC and paid for dinner there as well. We turned down the offer for the hotel room in EZE and were able to sleep in the Club Condor Lounge. This is easily better than most First Class Lounges I have seen. Aerolineas in my opinion did much more than Delta United or American would have done for us. Our kids got to spend time touring NYC for the night. Our only downside was the plane could have been cleaner. Sad for a new A330-200. Here the domestic carriers do a better job. For the price we paid on for the ticket and what we got it was well worth it.

,Aerolineas Argentinas,Economy Class,,26th August 2014,1,2,0,UnitedStates,2,no,I flew MIA-EZE-MIA round trip on Aerolineas Argentinas (AeroA) December 24 2013 returning January 7 2014. I bought the ticket online but their website is not set up to allow you to select your seat. So I called their 800 number in the US. I called for 3 days several times each day before someone answered the phone. This agent's English was so bad it took 20 minutes to select my seats. EZE airport check-in at Buenos Aires is chaos. On AeroA all passengers for the MIA flight stood in a single line to be checked-in for only that flight. The same for other flights. We found this out by asking other passengers what to do as there were no AeroA employees or announcement boards present. There were long long lines of passengers snaking through the terminal. Check-in was so slow we were concerned we would miss our flight even though we arrived 2 hours early. It didn't matter though because our flight was delayed 3 hours on a crystal-clear morning. When we arrived at MIA 3 hours late the AeroA gate agents had gone home and there was no one to help us with rebooking our connections to Chicago. The planes both ways were run-down and old on the inside. On the way down a ceiling panel rattled the entire 9 hours. The entertainment system did not work either direction. The flight attendants only appeared 4 times in 9 hours: to serve drinks after takeoff to serve and collect dinner serve and collect breakfast and hand out immigration and customs forms. My advice: 1) Do not fly Aerolineas Argentinas for any reason even if you have to change your travel plans to avoid them or pay more on another airline. 2) If you are unlucky enough to use them and have to fly out of Buenos Aires EZE airport arrive 3 hours early and prepare for the slowest and most disorganized check-in procedure you have ever experienced. 3) If you do not speak Spanish then you will receive only limited customer service on the phone and their web site is primitive. 4) Prepare yourself for old tatty airplanes with no working entertainment system and largely-invisible flight attendants.,,2,1,aerolineas-argentinas,Aerolineas Argentinas customer review,,,2,0,3b320176-adb7-49f9-be77-306976758b91

,Air Algerie,,,11th September 2006,0,0,0,,,no,I am an Algerian living the south East of England for last 24 years. My family and I use to fly Air Algerie from London to Algiers about twice a year. The service and the London office became so bad that it was almost impossible to buy a ticket. When Air Algerie was the only airline flying to Algeria people had to travel to London to buy their tickets. In the last few years more European airlines started to fly to Algeria. A lot of Algerians living in the UK prefer to fly Algeria via a connecting flight (Rome Milan and Paris) than flying with Air Algerie. The price of the ticket was in most cases more expensive. More recently BA started flying to Algiers from London and this provide us an alternative option. My family and most of our friends fly with BA with travelling to London.

Do not expect to have any cocktails since they only have wine beer and whisky. The dessert was a piece of rock (ice cream) and we received hard croissant and bread in our breakfast.

,Aerolineas Argentinas,Economy Class,,17th March 2014,1,3,0,Australia,,no,SYD-EZE on 29/10/2013 and returned EZE-SYD on 22/01/2014. The check-in at Sydney was slow and inefficient. There is no online check-in option for this flight and no seats are allocated prior to check-in so though you should only need to be there 2/3 hours before for an international flight I actually was told to get there 4 hours before just to get a decent seat and even then I queued for nearly an hour to check-in. Boarding was smooth and uneventful. The plane was clean but old. The in-flight entertainment system is horrendous. Considering this is a 15 hour direct flight there is no seat-back entertainment system. There is one large monitor at the front of the cabin and a few smaller ones spaces sporadically. The picture quality is terrible obviously no option to select subtitles if you are not a Spanish speaker. The movies were the same two films on repeat for the 15 hours. Nothing else. The food was adequate though the ran out of some food options leaving my companion to eat vegetarian or nothing else. Obviously the wine is good - it's Argentinean - but the drinks are just served with meals. If you press your call button it is ignored and switched off. I gave up trying to get some water. Breakfast was terrible none of it was edible. Flying back EZE-SYD was not much better. Check-in was a little easier and fortunately this time I managed to get a window seat. Upon boarding I discovered the plane was not full so I had two seats to myself. The only good thing to happen on this flight. The food was just as bad the availability or lack thereof of drinks was the same as before. The toilets were filthy and were obviously not checked or cleaned during the flight. The call-buttons were again ignored. The entertainment system was the same again this time they showed two English language films with Spanish subtitles a slight improvement but still the same on repeat for 15 hours. I would not recommend Aerolineas economy to anyone.,,4,2,aerolineas-argentinas,Aerolineas Argentinas customer review,,,2,0,feff09ed-883f-4c71-9ece-2739957d56dc

No allocated seating carry your own suitcase to the porters on the runway cabin crew never smile or ask if you are okay. Baggage allowance for different people. The only positive comment is they serve relatively hot food. What saddens me more than anything is the fact that the flight is so short it doesn't take alot to make it a good flight!

My ticket was purchased in the UK through an independent travel broker. No problems there but the ticket was not available for collection when I arrived to check-in at Heathrow. The incompetent Air Algerie rep then took one hour to sort this problem out. To add insult to injury I was flying business class but did not get to see the lounge or do any shopping as the check-in desk had closed by the the time my problem had been resolved. Business class on Air Algerie is a joke. The only additional privilege I could see was an extra four inches of leg room. The interior of the aircraft was shabby the upholstery was dirty and there was even old food and hair in the table stowage area. The food was ok and the service was relatively attentive but I couldn't help but think that it was all a bit too much of an effort for the staff. Come on Air Algerie. Get a grip on your customer service priorities refurbish the aircraft change the menu provide service with a smile - and keep the cabin clean!,,0,0,air-algerie,Air Algerie customer review,,,0,0,956be72c-7578-4cc3-89bf-c73731fb0f86

I always leave Montreal or Toronto for some European city and then connect with Air Algerie to Algiers. I also use Air Algerie domestically when i arrive to fly Algiers-Annaba. Flying with them every two years has given me the privilege of seeing the airline grow and IMPROVE. The food is great and plentiful even on the 2h flights from Paris and Frankfurt and the 1h30min. flights from Casablanca. Most other airlines don't even offer HOT meals on such short flights. I find their planes to be quite nice and they are trying to improve them. They phased out the 727s and 732s leaving only the newest and best also adding to it the Airbus 332s. The extension of the International terminal at Algiers gives you a more comfortable and modern lounge/check-in area and hopefully with the completion of the new terminal it will be even better. I find their only problem to be frequent delays. Other than that good service and good planes.,,0,0,air-algerie,Air Algerie customer review,,,0,0,dc1defd8-cef2-4c60-8dc3-e20d2ee72acf
,Air Algerie,,,24th June 2005,0,0,0,,,no,Lyon to Annaba on Air Algerie yesterday. My father who lives in Annaba flies Air Algerie regularly on work and is absolutely fed up with the airline. At Lyon one corner had been allocated for Air Algerie check-in. It seems even the airport authorities have given up on that corner. A good amount of chaos. In the line before the immigration gate few Algerians broke the wire cordon jumped in and broke the queue in spite of being reprimanded by airport officials. Boarding was disorganized with no priority boarding for business class or for the elderly. Upon entering the plane I discovered that seat numbers meant nothing. My seat was occupied and the FA politely told me I could sit anywhere! Food was horrible. They ran out of water bottles and started serving water in glasses poured out at the back of the aircraft. The water had a fair amount of salt in it. Upon landing at Annaba it took us over an hour to get out of the chaotic airport despite having cleared immigration in 10 minutes. Basically the bags took that long to come out and this when the Lyon flight was the only flight that arrived at the airport that time...when we landed there was not a single aircraft other than ours (domestic or international!!),,0,0,air-algerie,Air Algerie customer review,,,0,0,327f88c2-253a-4217-9e99-055b1dc20a39

Arrived in Buenos Aires at 5.30 am and went to our assigned gate at the domestic terminal. We were booked on Flight 1880 to Ushuaia that was to leave at 7.45 am (12/19/13) giving 30 hours to catch our 3pm (12/20/13) Antarctic cruise. Fl 1880 was postponed to 8.50 then to 10.30 without explanation. Then told the flight would leave at 3 pm. The flight didn't leave at 3.00 we were then told 8.30pm. What happened at 8.30 pm the postponed time for the scheduled flight is something out of a movie. We were never told that the flight was cancelled we were just told the flight would not be taking off. 2 hours later we were transported by bus out to the tarmac to board our plane to Ushuaia. After stopping at Trelow and taking on more passengers we were scheduled to arrive in Ushuaia about 2 am on 12/20. Landed at a small airport. The captain then for the first time announced that we were in El Calafete instead of Ushuaia. In the early morning hours of the 20th we are waiting in an unscheduled airport not knowing when or if we would arrive in Ushuaia. 2 hours later we board a plane and much to our relief we arrived in Ushuaia at 6am. Needless to say we did arrive at our cruise on time but we had one change of clothes to last us a whole 8 day cruise. We were never offered an explanation for the postponed and cancelled flights and then were diverted to a different airport without warning or explanation.

The airport security is top notch. The food served onboard is good for medium range flights. Contrary to what some people say Air Algerie does allocate seats like other airlines but it is true that some passengers seem to not take that into account which tends to stress the staff into attitudes that are not very friendly during the first 15mns of boarding. Air Algerie has seen a huge improvement in service with the introduction of new planes.

I can say with confidence that both security at airport and food during the flight are the best in the world. The Fleet maybe a little old but the level of maintenance carried out on the planes must be very high. The service provided by the crew is probably poor but I can assure you that the worst of Air-Algerie is the quality of the passengers. Everyone thinks the plane is his or her so he/she can seat anywhere smoke whenever they are pleased take overweighed hand luggage and use their mobile phones during the flight.

,Air Algerie,,,13th August 2004,0,0,0,,,no,My wife and I travel regularly between West Africa and Europe and about a year ago we decided to try Air Algerie to avoid the burden of Air France's unpleasant staff and ridiculously low checked baggage weight limits (economy: 23 kgs!). We were surprised to enjoy a relatively pleasant experience with Air Algerie (Y class) flying recent aircraft (738 and 735s) with acceptable delays (~15-30mns) and fast connections in Algiers on both legs for about half the cost of the AF ticket. The only negative side was a cold uncomfortable transit room in Algiers airport on the outbound flight. On that leg travel time incl. connection was shorter than that of AF. Given the above plus the quality and quantity of food served onboard highlighted by others I consider Air Algerie a fair alternative to Air France on Europe-West Africa routes.,,0,0,air-algerie,Air Algerie customer review,,,0,0,0798a988-d3ee-4fa8-8144-6ac4e18cf010

And the greater decision Air Algerie has taken is to eliminate smoking in their airplanes. For the delays I think is problem of security which is taken really seriously by Algerian authorities and also because there are simply not enough parking place at Algiers Airport which will be resolved with the new airport.,,0,0,air-algerie,Air Algerie customer review,,,0,0,7b030256-60cb-4454-aead-7ac7ff020048

She did not have the Shiraz wine that they listed on their menu either so I settled for whichever red wine she could give me. Lunch was mediocre and immediately after the service all flight attendant disappeared for about 7 hours until they brought the ""snack"". Not even a glass of water throughout the flight.

,Air Algerie,,,24th May 2003,0,0,0,,,no,I fly Air Algerie on a regular basis - they are habitually late because of security. For instance when departing Algiers all passengers must identify their luggage which is laid out on the tarmac prior to boarding the aircraft. For this I have no problem. The latest I have ever been leaving Algiers is 45 minutes. It gives me ample time to catch any connecting flights to my next destination. The other reason why they are quite often delayed flying back to Algiers is because there are simply not enough parking spots at the Airport in for incoming flights therefore they wait in Paris Rome Frankfurt etc until a spot can be allocated for the aircraft. The crew is always more than accommodating with refreshments and anything they can do to assist with comfort. They have eliminated smoking on the flights but some people still light up. When this happens they tell the person to put out the cigarette and if the person refuses they are told that should they refuse to extinguish the cigarette - then once they arrivedat the destination the local authorities will be contacted this usually takes care of the problem.,,0,0,air-algerie,Air Algerie customer review,,,0,0,99791199-8adb-42fe-bf09-c1ad78b6dce3

I was a little apprehensive after reading the comments here but in my case the flights all left close to on time and the aircraft were nearly new. Seating was comfortable and space was adequate.

,Aerolineas Argentinas,Economy Class,,22nd November 2013,0,2,0,UnitedStates,,no,I've flown this airline 12 times. Something bad has happened every single time. Aerolineas Argentinas has a near-monopoly in many Argentinean markets which is very unfortunate. On my most recent trip the flight schedules were changed an astounding 6 times within 3 months of departure with the final one being a cancellation of my flight and a new departure from a different airport. Once you do have an actual confirmed flight the chances of it leaving on time are close to zero. My personal record was an 8-hr delay causing me to miss my connecting flight back to the US.,,3,3,aerolineas-argentinas,Aerolineas Argentinas customer review,,,1,0,0ca551cf-3b26-47fa-9588-154abf6144ed

Cons: Seats are old and sometimes broken. Food is average they serve just 2 meals in a long flight so take some with you during the flight. Old airplane and does not have entertainment system. You need to take a tablet with you - they don't allow phones even in airplane mode.

Mixed experience first flight left at 2.40am from Rio to Buenos Aires on an Austral Embraer 190 and due to heavy turbulence there was no inflight service whatsoever on the 3 hour flight no apologies at all from the crew which I found rude. Short hops from BA to Montevideo and back uneventful. The return legs were better. Flights left and arrived on time crews on both Embraer 190 (Austral) and B737 did their job well.

,Aerolineas Argentinas,Economy Class,,6th November 2013,1,1,0,Australia,,no,The flight from Sydney to Buenos Aires was awful - the food was disgusting the toilets were not cleaned for hours - hence the smell. No entertainment other than outdated TV hanging from ceiling distorted picture and mainly in another language that could not understand. Seat in front of me was broken and was on a constant lean. The staff or should I say lack of it spent more time talking to one another or reading a magazine than attending to the passengers. The flight home was no better - it might of been cheaper but had I known what they were like I would of gladly paid the extra and flew with Qantas.

,Aerolineas Argentinas,Economy Class,,5th November 2013,1,2,0,Australia,1,no,By far the worst airline I have flown. Flew Sydney to Buenos Aires in a plane that looked like it was from the 60's. It was filthy on the outside and inside was even worse. When I opened my blanket on the plane it smelt. The staff were almost non existent during the entire flight.

Great value for money if you don't have high expectations of the airline in the first place. Flight to BA was fine. No delays and food ok.

Have to say was very surprised on the outbound flight as the crew were very nice and attentive the food was good and the ""new"" business seat OK. The inflight entertainment was the flight map since nothing else worked. The cabin was tatty but clean so all in all ok marks for that. The return on the other hand lived up to everything I have read. This crew would put to shame any US crew when it comes to sitting in the galley doing nothing. Food was terrible and yep got a thimbleful of wine. Glad it was overnight so I got to try and sleep but that was hard given the number of families that the pilot FA's and gate agents brought up to the business cabin.

Flight was delayed until 9.30am then until 1pm didn't leave Argentina until 2.30pm now stuck in Sydney airport on the floor because Qantas have a cut off time on the weekend and Aerolineas Argentinas managed to get me after the cut off time when I was supposed to be here at 5pm! If there is another airline out from Argentina I would take that instead if this one. Even the flight entertainment is poor. You don't get your own screen so you're stuck watching these old tvs that the worst picture known to man. The only good thing was that I got 2 seats to myself. Probably because everyone knows not to fly with them!,,1,3,aerolineas-argentinas,Aerolineas Argentinas customer review,,,1,0,3af4de71-68ca-4b08-8d3e-10bd051cc2e2
,Aerolineas Argentinas,Business Class,,2nd October 2013,1,5,0,Australia,8,yes,We flew return to Buenos Aries from Sydney. Condor class was not a lot more expensive than economy given the 16 hour trip. We had plenty of leg room and the food was excellent. The seats and everything seemed to function. Flights were on time and our luggage arrived on the carousel. Check in was speedy. As other reviewers noted the planes are old so I needed a cushion for lumbar support and we took tablets with books and movies downloaded. This worked very well with excellent picture and sound quality. Staff perhaps could have done more to keep others under control eg a couple immediately behind us watched videos on their laptop with no earplugs so we got the full sound while we were trying to sleep. Given the reviews we were pleasantly surprised with the trip.,,4,4,aerolineas-argentinas,Aerolineas Argentinas customer review,,,4,0,e8a6ae54-bde7-4dd4-91a5-7fa5a6f58091

We had no problems with any of the flights. They departed on time and our luggage arrived safely. Check in was super fast. The planes were reasonably modern and staff service OK. Food consisted of a snack box which was adequate for a short haul flight. While the flights were expensive prices were reduced considerably by purchasing discounted tickets before we arrived in Argentina.

,Aerolineas Argentinas,Economy Class,,15th July 2013,1,4,0,Australia,7,yes,Sydney to Buenos Aires return. Plane out very old and needing internal maintenance. A couple of overhead locker taped up with do not use notices. The TV that I could see did not work. Didn't see the cabin staff smile once. Seats are tired and sagged. Food was good though I had taken bits to eat but the meal we got was good. No in flight services after the meal but drinks and snacks available. On the way back we were at the airport 23 hours before the flight (due to our connection) and requested a row of seats together. Couldn't check us in as check-in opened 3 hours before. When we checked in 3 hours before we were sat in different seats over the plane and told there were no available seats! Managed to get the children sat together and myself and my wife were in separate seats. On return the plane was in a slightly better shape a little newer. The TV was working but lost the red so some interesting colours for the films. Reasonable films and one channel in English. Food was again good. The cabin staff were great. All smiles and they came round every couple of hours with water/juice.

,Aerolineas Argentinas,Economy Class,,10th July 2013,1,2,0,Australia,,no,Flew home from Sao Paulo to Sydney in January 2012. 4-hour delay departing change of aircraft at Buenos Aires resulted in an 8-hour delay. Passengers asked to wait in a lounge then abandoned. No staff for several hours. After 6 hours we got a rapid announcement in Spanish. Passengers were English-speaking Australians! BA to Auckland was unpleasant. TV screens were not working well. The girl in front of me ordered a vegetarian meal as did I. Of course they did not have it. They never have vegetarian meals. The hostess actually argued with the girl and told her that it was her fault that the meal was not ordered. The final insult was a 4-hour delay at Auckland Airport.

,Aerolineas Argentinas,Economy Class,,28th June 2013,3,4,0,Australia,8,yes,Flight between Sydney and Buenos Aires was pretty good. Staff were friendly and spoke English! Once I arrived in Buenos Aires this changed. Next flight was to Sao Paulo but they refer to it as San Pablo. This flight was delayed a couple of hours but the staff were pretty good. Once I arrived at Sao Paulo the service was not as good but still okay. Staff seem tired and run down. Staff at the gate could not decide which gate the airline was at. If your a person of English speaking background and don't know much Spanish or Portuguese it pays to find someone to translate. I flew to Curitiba and the service was excellent and staff were friendly! We arrived on time. On the way back my flight got delayed and was going to be diverted from Buenos Aires due to poor weather.

Before buying the ticket I researched the airline so I would know what to expect. It exceeded my expectations. Got the above ticket for AUD 3700.00 The only sectors in economy were AEP-FTE-AEP. Of the 7 flights all left on time except one and that only was delayed 20 mins. Food was great service was great. If you wanted anything they were more than obliging to help.

I wasn't able to eat the food served because my agent (nothing to do with AA) forgot to send the request for vegetarian food (must be done when the booking is made) and they didn't have much options for non- meat eaters.

No apology from staff for not having a place for me and my son to return to Sydney. I also lost time at work which I was not paid for.

,Aerolineas Argentinas,Business Class,,28th April 2013,1,1,0,Australia,,no,We flew Club Condor (business class) from Sydney to Buenos Aires and then on Austral (regional airline) to Rio and back. It is obviously an airline of a country in economic crisis. Aircraft used on the SYD-EZE-SYD route is like stepping back into 1975. Big old recliner seats (not flat) 3 scheduled movies on a continuous loop. No laptop power etc. The service is very basic to other carriers. AA club condor service is similar to what's offered in economy on other carriers. This is an extremely long flight close to 16 hours yet AA still doesn't use their brand new Airbus with lie flat beds I believe this is used to Madrid and back for obvious reasons. The crew on all sectors didn't really want to be there. EZE-SYD is one of the longest flights in the world made even longer by the aircraft and the service. We would choose to go with Qantas/LAN via Santiago in future trips to South America.,,1,1,aerolineas-argentinas,Aerolineas Argentinas customer review,,,2,0,88646296-8d16-4935-b54a-7b58993bf697

,Aerolineas Argentinas,Business Class,,21st April 2013,2,4,0,Australia,7,yes,Sydney to Buenos Aires and return in April 2013 in business class. Yes it's an old aircraft and the seats are only the old lounge chair type. Also the entertainment is limited. But they are replacing the A340-200 with a 300 series later this year so that should solve these problems. The business class check in was performed meticulously and lounge access given at both airports. Priority boarding was strictly enforced. The on board service was friendly and very personal. My coat snatched away and hung up as soon as I arrived at my seat. The catering was adequate and appropriate for such a long flight. Main courses were presented and served from a trolley in the cabin. They did offer fast track on departure but not on arrival. Still the airport in Sydney was so quiet it was unnecessary. One small criticism is that the Sydney arrival cards were in Spanish. Not easy for us Aussies. The price paid for the ticket represented unbelievable value. I'd fly the again without hesitation.,,2,4,aerolineas-argentinas,Aerolineas Argentinas customer review,,,5,0,555ab43d-39d9-435d-9c0d-64082e06d687

Food out on the night flight was okay but could only have 1 half glass of wine. Trip back again no online check in be at the airport 3 hrs before but had to stand around for 50 mins before any processing began. Was told 3 weeks before the flight it would be delayed 20 mins - got to the Airport it was shown to be 1 hr delay but eventually the 8.30am flight departed at 11am. Food was dreadful but this time could get more than 1 glass of wine. There was no explanation as to why the flight was delayed. Experienced similar on Austral (a subsidiary) had to be there 2hrs before and it still departed late. Iguazu-Salta cheese sandwich offered which was thicker - the bread or cheese?

,Aerolineas Argentinas,Economy Class,,3rd April 2013,1,1,0,Australia,1,no,My husband and I recently travelled on Aerolineas Argentinas from Buenos Aires. There was no facility for web check-in or to have our seats pre-allocated prior to check-in. We arrived more than 2 hours prior to the flight to be told that the only way we could sit together was to take 2 middle seats in the centre row of the plane. The A340 has a 2-4-2 configuration. In such a configuration 50% of the seats are aisle seats. However it appeared that almost all had been pre-allocated prior to the ordinary check-in opening. In the end we were offered an aisle and a middle seat in the very back row. It is time that Aerolineas recognized that families are entitled to expect to sit together on long haul flights without having to take the worst seats on the plane. Other airlines manage to do this why cant Aerolineas?,,2,2,aerolineas-argentinas,Aerolineas Argentinas customer review,,,3,0,03985dd5-cd2c-4f69-8066-5259e34e65bf

The seats are rock hard but with better leg room than many. No on-line check-in or seat selection. No early bag drops on transfers meaning I had to wait for 3 hours at EZE before passing through immigration. (At 2am.) No in-seat entertainment and the two in-cabin screens-and sound - only worked part of the time. The same low res movies shown in both directions. The food coming back from EZE was the worst I have ever had on an airline with a tiny dried-up croissant tiny hard roll and insipid yoghurt offered as breakfast and pasta with a teaspoon of tasteless tomato sauce for lunch. I could not even get any pepper when I asked. Red wine was good though. Food out of SYD was much better. Excellent new terminal C at Ezeiza and 57 nice new aircraft in Argentina - pity these advancements don't extend to the Australian part of the operation.

Plane full with lots of legroom for 18 year old plane. Food was ok with snacks and drinks which you had to get yourself. Great views of the Antarctica if only the staff would let us see most of the flight the shades were kept down. Bring your own entertainment but they did show a couple of movies.

The plane seemed very old. Inflight entertainment poor quality TV and screen. Food was just bearable. The only flight that left on time was the one out of Sydney. First and last time flying with AA. Delay in BA to Santiago due to not wanting to fuel the plane in the rain. Delay from Santiago to BA no idea why. A supposed delay of 22 mins which turned into just over an hour from BA to Sydney which caused me to miss my connecting flight. So overall not happy with the experience.

,Aerolineas Argentinas,Business Class,,8th October 2012,1,4,0,Australia,8,yes,We flew on direct flights Sydney to BA return in September 2012 - the attraction of a lower business class fare than competitors and a direct flight swayed us into trying the airline. The outward flight left early from Sydney and arrived early in BA. The return flight left 30 minutes late but picked up the time on the way home. On both sectors the service was prompt and efficient. Food and wine was good but not presented as top tier carriers would present. The entertainment system was archaic limited and not on demand. This is well documented by other reviewers. We took kindles and an ipad and once we watched one movie we were quite happy to read and play. Views of the Antarctic ice sheet also kept us amused on the way home. Seats are old style business but we did sleep nearly 9 hours on the night flight on the way over. If this one experience is the norm for this sector I would recommend the business class offering given the price advantages - you can overcome the most significant weakness (IFE) by buying movies for your ipad and you can buy plenty for the saving in air fares.,,3,4,aerolineas-argentinas,Aerolineas Argentinas customer review,,,5,0,acef94ec-f687-47d6-bee2-b6d9c96545b5
,Aerolineas Argentinas,Economy Class,,16th September 2012,0,1,0,Australia,2,no,A340-200 SYD-EZE. I felt like I have stepped back in time when flying with this airline. They need to update the seating in the older aircraft. Very little attention is paid to safety carry on bags were left unsecured on seats during take-off. Seats were broken and reclined without pushing the recline button. Despite the seats being broken passengers were permitted to use them. There was no personal entertainment and it is strictly bring your own. Before and soon after take-off the cabin became very cold. Approx 1 hour into the flight the seat belt sign was turned off for the first time shortly after staff delivered the food. There was no choice of meal (chicken or red meat) let alone a vegetarian selection. After dinner the food trays were collected and the lights turned off and all passengers were expected to sleep. The staff must have also turned up the temperature as the aircraft cabin became very hot and stuffy. The flight was 14 hours and passengers were expected to sleep 10 of those hours. Approx 2 hours before landing the lights were turned back on we were fed again and the cabin became very cold. Trays removed just in time to land in Buenos Aires. Staff were seen at the rear of the craft playing on laptops and not offering any drink runs to passengers.,,3,3,aerolineas-argentinas,Aerolineas Argentinas customer review,,,3,0,438fa14e-663d-46ae-8692-cd45367a843f
,Aerolineas Argentinas,Economy Class,,6th September 2012,1,3,0,Australia,4,no,FCO (Rome) - EZE. The lack of IFE was an obvious flaw but my tablet computer lasted the whole journey so it was ok. The food wasn't great but the white wine was superb. Staff were very nice and even though I was Australian flying from Italy they all spoke perfect English. Flying Aerolineas was very much what it was like to fly domestic in Australia in the nineties - not great but bearable.,,3,4,aerolineas-argentinas,Aerolineas Argentinas customer review,,,3,0,12752993-0d65-4b59-864e-cbe3e0ae068f
,Aerolineas Argentinas,Economy Class,,4th September 2012,0,3,0,Australia,7,yes,I recently flew with AR on the new direct SYD-EZE service. I must say after reading the previous reviews here that I was pleasantly surprised. Flights were on time cabin crew were friendly (more so on the return leg) seat pitch in economy was actually very good cabin was clean and tidy. Yes there are no back of seat entertainment screens but for the price you cannot expect 5 star services. If being entertained is an issue bring your ipad or a good book! Food was OK. On the return flight after dinner service sandwiches were self- served from the rear of the cabin and it would be beneficial here to at least offer a selection (for us veggies rather than the ubiquitous ham and cheese). Overall the flight was as good as any for the price – in fact the worst part was actually going through customs at EZE  which took well over an hour. I thought I had landed at LAX! Overall I would recommend this airline if you are after a well-priced airfare – just don't expect 5 star amenities services for a 3 star price.,,4,4,aerolineas-argentinas,Aerolineas Argentinas customer review,,,5,0,a2f2b30b-a5c7-458e-9e44-e9e5f453b33a
,Aerolineas Argentinas,Economy Class,,28th August 2012,1,4,0,Australia,4,no,I flew from Lima to Sydney via Buenos Aires. My flight in Buenos Aires was delayed 1.5 hours but Aerolineas did not communicate with us at all! They announced a couple of times in Spanish thank you for your patience but that was it. Finally when we boarded it took another hour to take off! The people on my flight were complaining of the terrible service they had already experienced with Aerolineas. When I arrived in Sydney I had missed my connecting flight and so had half of the passengers I was with. We all had to pay for new tickets to our next destination which cost me $170 to Melbourne! Their entertainment was poor they played the same movie over and over and when passengers asked for help staff ignored them! Pretty bad service is an understatement.,,3,2,aerolineas-argentinas,Aerolineas Argentinas customer review,,,4,0,aaff9af2-5bf3-4b10-b71c-c37372546730
,Aerolineas Argentinas,Economy Class,,28th August 2012,2,3,0,Australia,8,yes,SYD-EZE-SYD. Plane is an older A340-200 - without personal IFE - just a main screen. Economy class seats were generously sized and I was offered an emergency exit seat from SYD-EZE. EZE-SYD was a standard economy class seat. Plane departed on time from SYD-EZE and again EZE-SYD. Staff friendly and always walking around. Food was edible but there wasn't much of it. A small self-serve bar in the galley provided water and snacks during the flight. Both flights the plane landed on time and overall was a pleasant experience. Despite being limited in features I got from SYD to EZE and back cheaply comfortably and if you bring your iPad/iPod you'll be entertained. If there was no price difference between AR and LAN/Qantas etc. consider going on the latter. But AR isn't a bad airline provided you've got some personal entertainment on the long 13-15 hour flights. One final point - the AR website is incredibly hard to navigate and use. Calls to their SYD call centre go without answer.,,4,4,aerolineas-argentinas,Aerolineas Argentinas customer review,,,4,0,8a1000d9-b70c-4d58-a5f8-020c8ac5df4a

I found the service better and aircraft was old but with more legroom. The crew was also good and trying to help passengers as it was a long flight of 16 hrs.

Overall we enjoyed and would definitely go again.,,4,4,aerolineas-argentinas,Aerolineas Argentinas customer review,,,5,0,6e50286e-0617-49b1-900a-0d643ad7c614
,Aerolineas Argentinas,Economy Class,,20th August 2012,0,1,0,Australia,1,no,They delayed my flight by 3 days and were incredibly rude and unapologetic. I was supposed to fly from Sydney to Buenos Aires via Auckland and Santiago. I turned up at the check in counter in Sydney and was told the flight would be delayed because the plane hadn't arrived yet from Auckland but it would only be a couple of hours. When I returned they said the plane would not be arriving after all and that we would not leave Sydney for another two days. Staff were rude and unhelpful and once we were taken to the accommodation we didn't hear from them again except for a piece of paper under the hotel door telling us to be ready at 5am. After two days we went back to airport there was no staff member there and we had to go from counter to counter trying to find out which flight we were on. After finally checking in and going through immigration we were at the boarding gate when we were told that we would not be flying out after all as there was no plane to meet us in Auckland. No staff representative. I ended up changing to LAN Chile who were excellent.,,0,1,aerolineas-argentinas,Aerolineas Argentinas customer review,,,1,0,6cb672b3-fa02-4202-8a6c-ff5f4fa9e9b2
,Aerolineas Argentinas,Economy Class,,26th July 2012,1,3,0,Australia,6,yes,Return flight (Sydney-Buenos Aires). The fare was really competitive. Flight left on time from Sydney to Buenos Aires. Food was below average (Fish and rice for dinner and very small sandwiches for breakfast and middle snack). On board entertainment is the worst entertainment I have witnessed. Flight attendants were nice. On my way back flight delayed 30 minutes. Food was good (Chicken and rice for lunch. Croissant tea and fruits for breakfast and small chicken sandwich for middle snack). On board entertainment was better than the first flight. Pros: Excellent price - On time flights - Friendly staff. Cons: No personal entertainment nor good screens - Bad food on first flight - Staff didn't allow me to use my iphone in flight mode - not very tidy (though not dirty).,,3,4,aerolineas-argentinas,Aerolineas Argentinas customer review,,,5,0,0d51b434-364c-4d68-b21c-2d076d1de482

,Aerolineas Argentinas,Economy Class,,15th July 2012,1,2,0,NewZealand,4,no,Flew AKL-EZE/AEP-GIG-AEP/EZE-AKL. Both long-haul legs were close to being on time but the baggage wait in BA was around 40 min (thus missed the transfer bus to the other airport in BA and had to get a cab). Upon arrival at AEP I was checked-in for the flight to Rio as normal. But 20 min after the schedule boarding time everyone was informed that AR decided to switch the departing airport back to EZE (and this is already at 10pm). So had to re-clear the custom collect our baggage wait for 30 min for the bus take the 1 hour bus ride to the other side of the town re-check in and re-clear the custom at EZE (which took 1 hour). Finally landed in Rio at 3.30am 4 hours late. No compensation was offered whatsoever. The return flights were relatively stress-free. Overall the cabin service was above average but planes are antiquated with no personal entertainment but a leaky roof. Breakfast on the 13 hour long-haul consisted of two pieces of cold bread and a banana. Much cheaper than LAN but definitely not worth the money paid.,,3,4,aerolineas-argentinas,Aerolineas Argentinas customer review,,,2,0,8796d86c-96e0-4a66-a55f-51903286d6ff
,Aerolineas Argentinas,Economy Class,,15th July 2012,0,1,0,Norway,1,no,Was booked on the flight on the 13th of July from EZE-SYD (which does not go via AKL anymore). I checked- in and everything was confirmed with my seat etc. I was at the airport at 6am for the 8.30am flight. After 1 hour in line I was only half way down the queue. A little bit later other passengers bound for SYD were denied access. The following reason was given: the weather pattern on the route to SYD. Therefore they had to get rid of weight to have a lighter aircraft to make it the entire way. Later we learnt that they had given freight/cargo priority and consequently 80 of us were stranded with the next flight due 3 days later which only had 40 free spots. The employees only spoke Spanish which was hard for people who didn't know the language. Lots of ideas were thrown around but evidently the flight left without us. I had checked the flight the days/weeks before I was due to fly it and noticed that the flight always left EZE delayed by 1-2 hours which could be for similar reasons. Maybe they should go back to flying via AKL to be able to accept all the paid passengers. Their compensation was not good either and I (and several others) decided we wanted a full refund.,,0,1,aerolineas-argentinas,Aerolineas Argentinas customer review,,,0,0,241e5fd2-2ec2-41b5-8915-b362f8bb502c

Long story short we stayed overnight at the airport (with 5 children) and the next day we were flown to Corrientes instead of Resistencia.

,Aerolineas Argentinas,Economy Class,,9th January 2012,1,4,0,Australia,3,no,Sydney to Buenos Aires with AL return a disappointing experience. Both flights left an hour late without explanation. When we booked flights in Australia we chose our seats and our choice apparently accepted. We reconfirmed this at check-in but upon entering the aircraft we discovered this not to be the case and we were not even sitting together. On the first flight the audio did not work on my seat and on the other the visuals were running without audio. Staff tried to speak English but generally had a poor capability so communicating in Spanish was more effective. Some staff were unfriendly and all staff disappeared for about five hours after serving the meal on leaving BA. Snacks and drinks were available in the galley areas but this was not announced so passengers only found out about it through diffusion. We flew a number of internal flights with LAN which is worlds ahead of AL on service.,,3,1,aerolineas-argentinas,Aerolineas Argentinas customer review,,,3,0,e73ebf14-5e33-455e-a8a3-bff8fae0aa20

There was a single screen for entertainment but no headphones were passed out during one flight until the movie had run! The movies were old. The food was decidedly average. The plane fittings appeared old - my seat bottom was entirely loose from its frame and two of the bathroom doors I used wouldn't close properly. The toilets were not serviced at all during the long 12 hours flights so they were pretty horrible by the end. The crew were friendly and bilingual but once meals were served they did not really appears. I wouldn't seek to fly with this airline again unless there were no other options.

They served even on this short flight a little breakfast with cold-cuts and cold omelette which was ok. As the previous comment states the problem is rather the infrastructure on the ground. Everything is still very old fashioned with hand written tickets and passenger lists and baggage handled by hand or on trolleys pushed by man as well and power shortage even in public airport areas. Booked through local travel agent who kept us informed of flight changes so saved us the hassle to deal with airline ticket sales directly.

,Air Bagan,,,20th March 2007,0,0,0,,,no,Air Bagan may be Myanmar’s fastest growing airline even having international ambitions but we had the experience they are not really that well organized internally. We booked a number of domestic flights with them and tickets were written out with OK status on February the 12th when we picked them up in their downtown Yangon office. A week later when we checked in at Nyaung U for a NYE-HEH flight Air Bagan staff told us flight AKY-RGN we booked was cancelled and we had to contact Air Bagan in Taunggyi once we arrived in HEH to arrange alternative travel. After arrival in HEH we contacted Air Bagan in Taunggyi who told us no flights were cancelled. We asked them to verify this again and later that night Air Bagan called us we didn’t have to worry and the AKY-RGN flight would certainly fly. A few days later we flew HEH-SNW and as we had a reservation to fly SNW-AKY the next day we once more checked with Air Bagan at SNW airport on the AKY-RGN flight. We now were told AKY-RGN was cancelled as AKY airport would be closed ‘for maintenance’ for several days! The SNW-AKY we booked would still operate but as return flights for the next days would not operate we of course decided to cancel SNW-AKY. Air Bagan didn’t seem to understand why we didn’t want to fly SNW-AKY. Having no return flight from AKY didn’t seem to be an issue for them and they suggested us to buy a full fare SNW-RGN flight. They agreed to refund us the cancelled flights (after paying a cancellation fee) but refund could only be made in the Air Bagan office where we paid the tickets! This would mean we had to go back to downtown Yangon what we hadn’t planned into our travel schedule anymore. After several discussions with Air Bagan staff in SNW and with the help of our hotel manager in Ngapali the next day when we showed up at SNW airport for the SNW-RGN flight local Air Bagan staff appeared to be very helpful and tickets were paid back at SNW airport and fare for the SNW-RGN was ‘Town Office’ and not ‘Published’ full fare. We were very pleased local Air Bagan staff in SNW understood the issue and willing as well to refund us but next time I book a flight with them I’ll think twice.,,0,0,air-bagan,Air Bagan customer review,,,0,0,f3f96357-f9a7-44b6-b0eb-0c562818b953

A350-900,Aeroflot Russian Airlines,Business Class,January 2022,30th January 2022,5,4,2,UnitedKingdom,5,no,"Aeroflot has set high standards of achieving a 5-star airline status and my expectations significantly increased as a result. Positives included a seamless upgrade from Comfort to Business at LHR, good Plaza Premium lounge, very good miles earning vs redeeming ratio. The A350 hard product is phenomenal, especially on a short London route, and the catering on this flight exceeded the expectations (usually poor hot meal, however, the 4 cheese pappardelle was very good). However, there are two drawbacks on Aeroflot. Firstly, I  dislike Aeroflot’s or SVO’s standard practice of parking planes at the literally remotest ramps possible in -6C and with ice covering the stairs. I understand there maybe logistics issues, but doing so to a premium-heavy flight like London and for their most luxurious widebody is just beyond logic. I am observing that the crew service on the A350 / B777 is poorer than on their other planes. It gave me a feeling that the crew were very much undertrained as a result the service, although efficient, felt very rushed and unpolished.  I still believe that the Aeroflot Business Class is above any of its European counterparts from the overall package size view, and if one manages to upgrade for miles (amazing redemption value) like I often do, then this product is possibly the best business class. However, full-fare paying passengers might be disappointed, because, in addition to a cutting-edge hard product, for such money, you expect a hospitable and personalised staff service beyond the ‘just tick’ attitude.

,Aeroflot Russian Airlines,Economy Class,April 2020,2nd November 2020,0,0,0,Australia,1,no,"My flight was cancelled by Aeroflot back in April. We called multiple times throughout April, May and June and I was promised a refund of the full amount. It was obviously not up to me whether to take that flight or not and it is reasonable to expect a full refund. However refund was never provided. I tried to send multiple messages to the airline’s customer service as well with no response. Last week I tried to call Aeroflot customer service. I had to pay for the international call as there are no representatives in Australia where I live. The customer service was extremely poor. To be honest, I have not encountered such poor attitude in years and it was extremely frustrating. The customer service representative could not properly address any of the issues. She said that the only two options are a voucher and reissuing new ticket. Well, I don’t live in Russia or even Europe so there is absolutely no way I can use these options. The reason why I bought a ticket with Aeroflot was that the transfer time was convenient on my way from Rome to Tokyo, I was not even intending to visit Russia. I explained it and no, nothing she was willing to do, just continued quoting new Russian legislation that came into effect half a year after I bought the ticket! I asked to explain how come I was promised a refund previously and was held waiting for months and months and now it’s not an option. She couldn’t explain. She said I can submit complain through the feedback section. I explained that I have tried to communicate the issue through the feedback section already and not getting any response. She said she can’t help with. Then I asked her to connect me to her supervisor and no, she couldn’t do it for some reason. This is the first time ever I couldn’t speak to a customer service manager or a supervisor. Basically the company just decided to keep my money that I paid, go ahead with it and customer service did not care at all. I just lost a lot of money on the international call without any resolution. This situation is absolutely ridiculous and unacceptable. Every other airline I booked with that cancelled flights provided me a refund a while ago, despite COVID-19. Understand there are struggles at the moment and I did accept a voucher from an Australian airline because I can use it living in Australia. But I just can't use an Aeroflot voucher. The ticket wasn’t a cheap ticket either and it was refundable and it is outrageous that I can’t get money back for a ticket that was refundable (and I paid a premium for it to be refundable and have an option to receive a refund). I sent another message to the airline following the call and received the same response about vouchers that is pretty much just their copy paste from the customer service templates. The airline does not care about their customers and reputation and is just exploiting COVID-19 situation to hold customers’ cash for as long as possible (if not indefinite).",Rome to Tokyo via Moscow,0,0,aeroflot-russian-airlines,The customer service was extremely poor,Couple Leisure,Not Verified,1,0,eb953463-76e6-4346-bac3-537c2bf732e3

The check-in process was prompt as was the departure. It was reassuring to see that security was taken seriously and several checks took place before boarding. My only gripe was that no provision was made for elderly people, disabled passengers and those with babies to have priority boarding. Some passengers were allowed to take far too much hand luggage while others were strictly controlled. A lack of consistency was apparent. The cabin crew were efficient. Service was based on those who preordered items online. The staff then performed a purchase trolley service. This service was well organised. Full credit to the staff. The seats were comfortable and a route map was used on this A320. Disembarkation was a reasonable affair but the crew were not to be seen to say farewell the passengers and the captain did not make any announcement either.

The ground staff was so rude. I had 30 kg allowance. And, 10 kg cabin bag. I had 9 kg in my cabin bag, and laptop in hand bag. I was trying to add extra baggage from 3 days prior to my flight. There was no option where I could add extra baggage. I called up the call centre, and even the lady was so rude. She told me the flight is booked. I asked her if what If I'm told at the check in to lay for my extra baggage? To which she replied, I don't know. So, this clearly means the flight was not booked and the customer service so nicely lied. This is not the first time it happened. I was travelling from Tbilisi to Ahemdabad in June'2022 and I was faced with the same issue. I wanted to add extra baggage. And there was no option to add. And when I called up the call centre, they said the flight is booked. This is not the way to treat the customers. This is such a bad service! I was holding my medical book in my hand. I told them I have to study in the flight. They did not let me carry the book. They made me weigh my laptop bag and my cabin bag. They asked me to pay for my laptop bag. The airport price for per kg is 1300 inr, which is comparatively eay too expensive than online prices. They clearly only wanted to loot us customers. When I told the check-in authorities about it, they clearly blamed me that I'm lying. I showed them my student residency card, telling them that I'm a student and I need my book. They didn't listen to anything. No airline checks the laptop bag. Yet, they do this to us everytime. I tried explaining them so much, no one was ready to listen. It was a horrendous experience.

Embraer 170,Air Burkina,Economy Class,November 2018,11th February 2019,0,4,1,Israel,4,no,"I was booked to fly non stop from Abidjan to Ouagadougou (Burkina Faso) with Air Burkina. Their website was surprisingly easy to maneuver ,and in a few minutes my ETKT was issued. I guess i was smart to ask the Concierge at my hotel in Abidjan to confirm my flight the day before.Air Burkina had my email,but no notices whatsoever re the dramatic change.To my unpleasant surprise he was told my flight was cancelled, and i was rebooked on a different flight at 0800 rather than 1115. I was at the check in counters at 0600 per the instructions of the reservation office in Abidjan. Im sure the Concierge understood well the new information he received from Air Burkina's office. To my unpleasant surprise i was refused to be checked in and was told to wait, as 'there is a problem with my ticket'. I waited patiently till ALL passengers were checked in, and then i was told by hand signs (No English spoken by the check in supervisor) that the flight is full, and to go and see the agents at Air Burkina's office in the terminal. There i was told by an agent that I'm booked on a different flight at 3pm. I insisted that i had a seat on the early morning flight, as i trusted the information i got from the hotel in the city. I was promised i had a seat at 3pm,but already i had my doubts at that point. I asked why they didn't accept me on the 0800 flight as they cancelled my original flight, and even if i had no reservation per their version, i thought i was entitled to standby for the morning flight. ""No"" was the answer. Reason: the flight was stopping in Accra where it was going to be filled up 100%. I told the agents that i thank them for their efforts, and i am not going to wait 8 hours at the airport for 'maybe' flying at 3pm. I left their office trying to figure out a way out of Ivory Coast as i had a Business class ticket on Ethiopian from Ouagadougou to Addis Ababa, and hoped Ethiopian Airlines would reissue my ticket to fly from Abidjan to Addis. Suddenly i was approached by the Air Burkina agent, who offered me to pay 'penalty' for a flight change from 3pm to 8 am of 50Euro - I had to pay Air Burkina 50 EURO because THEY cancelled my flight. Amazing! The 100% full flight from Accra excuse was no longer an issue. I decided to pay despite the convoluted business conduct of Air Burkina, so i don't miss my visit to Burkina Faso for 50 Euro. I paid, and quickly was rushed to the aircraft. Out of Accra there were at least 20 empty seats and Business class was 100% empty. So much for correct information. The aircraft was an ex LOT airliner in terrible shape, torn seats, dirty cabin, toilets without toilet paper. Drinks were served from Abidjan to Accra's 30 minute flight,and a hot tasty meal was offered on the 1 hour flight from Accra to Ouagadougou. Quite impressive service.

First my mother received an itinerary and a payment confirmation only to arrive at the airport to be told that her ticket was not issued and that she would have to purchase another. She complained about this and Air Botswana tried to calm the situation down stating that she will be reimbursed for the purchase. The second issue was that i had a connecting flight from Johannesburg to Gaborone with air Botswana. My initial flight was from Cape Town. 2hrs before my departure from Cape Town i get informed that the flight from Johannesburg to gabs was cancelled. I was forced to take the flight from Cape Town to Johannesburg but to purchase accommodation for the next day for when air Botswana could give me another flight. I was not reimbursed for the expenses incurred. The third issue is the same as the first which happened to my brother who experienced the same issue as my mother. The fourth issue occurred this morning when I arrived at the check im desk after having travelled 300km on road to get to Gaborone Airport I was inform that although I have a payment confirmation from DPO Pay, Air Botswana had still not received any reflected money in their account and thus would have to purchase another ticket from the ticket sales. This resulted in me having to pay all my travel money and borrowing some to purchase this ticket. I am a student and one can only imagine the difficulty this caused.

It has been delayed to 3pm and will land in Joburg at 6pm. Leaving us with 1h35 to catch our flight in Joburg. Quite difficult to do but doable. I wrote to customer service to ask them if it will be ok to have such a short transit time in Joburg, but they never answered me. When we arrived in Maun, we told the Air Botswana representative that we had to register on our flight to Europe because we will not have time to do it. They told us that they will try to. 30 min before departure, we learned by Canadian tourists that the flight had been delayed to 5pm. We ask Air Botswana to book us on another flight for Europe. After long minutes on their back they told us that we were booked on Virgin Atlantic instead of Swiss. It was ok for us even if the transit time would be short (1h20). We only wanted to be in Paris the next morning, so making a stop in Zurich or London wasn't an issue for us. During the flight we asked flight attendants that we will have a short transit time in Joburg and to organize something to make sure we catch our virgin Atlantic flight. We had to ask twice because we made a stop in Gaborone and flight attendants changed. When we arrived a van was there to drive us to the virgin atlantic terminal. Everything seems fine right? Well when we wanted to check in on Virgin Atlantic, the attendants told us that my ticket could not be emitted, leaving my wife alone. No one at Air Botswana told us that there was a problem with the ticket. Due to their incompetence, we had to sleep at the airport hotel.

,Air Austral,,,10th August 2004,0,0,0,,,no,I currently live in London and I fly once a year to Reunion for holidays. I use to fly on Air France in classe Alize (Economy Plus) but recently I tried Air Austral for the first time in Classe Loisirs (Economy) and was far more satisfied with the level of customer care in terms of punctuality high food quality and friendly staff. As being part of the Air France Frequence Plus scheme the good news is I can get some qualifying miles and this code-share flight makes my life easy as I don't need to change airport - ie remaining in CDG and not going to Orly. So I would recommend Air Austral in terms of: Comfort: their B777 is modern the seats are more comfortable and you have more space to put your hand luggage in the compartments above your head. Food: even in Classe Loisirs you have a huge plateau and you are really spoilt. Customer care: excellent staff. They provide you with warm towels as you get on board and in the morning. They also pass through at night asking you if you want some water while everyone is asleep. Everything with a smile! Punctuality: both outbound and return flights left on time. Unfortunately I read that Air France will stop this code-share flight with Air Austral and I find this decision very sad. I wish everyone who is part of Frequence Plus loyalty scheme to convince Air France to come back to its decision as the CDG-RUN-CDG must not disappear. Air Austral is the getaway to Reunion via CDG for all European and worldwide customers and you won't be disappointed.

Warning to anyone who is considering flying with them: if you expect even mediocre customer service do yourself a favor and stay away. We were supposed to fly from Maun with Air Botswana to land in Johannesburg landing at 4 pm with a full four hours to spare before our long haul flight back to the US via Delta. When we arrived at the Maun airport chaos had ensued. What appeared to be a huge tour group had the spotlight and despite reaching the front of the line to check in we were completely ignored as the attendants told us they needed to tend to others first. Service was exorbitantly slow as there were only 2 attendants who were hand writing boarding passes. After an hour of waiting we were told the flight was oversold and we would not be getting on. We’re convinced that although we had booked our flights 6 months earlier we were bumped along with about 20 others from the flight in favor of the tour group. You can imagine the hysteria as the majority of the 20 had connecting flights in Johannesburg. The attendants assured us that we would get on another plane that was routed to Cape Town but would first stop in Johannesburg to drop us off by 6 pm. We found this odd but at that point had no other choice. It was only after we boarded the plane that we discovered we were instead going to Gaborone and from there another plane would take us to Johannesburg immediately. When we reached Gaborone the Air Botswana rep was extremely confused why we had arrived and told us we had been lied to and would have to wait another 1.5 hours to take off. Not surprisingly the flight was further delayed so we finally arrived in Jo'burg at 8.30 minutes after our second leg to Atlanta took off. We were extremely upset but told we’d be waitlisted for the next Delta flight out - which unfortunately was not for a full 24 hours. The real kicker? We were told you owe us $650 USD. Still can’t quite comprehend how they had the gall to say this to our faces but at this point nothing surprised us. No reps from either Air Botswana or Delta were available to give us a definitive answer on whether we’d be guaranteed to be on the flight so off we went to a local hotel in hopes of returning the next day to get everything straightened out. The people who work for this airline not only have the poorest customer service skills I have ever witnessed. When we arrived on day 2 to try to check in to Delta we were told we only had a 50/50 shot of getting on the plane. There is one flight per day and subsequent flights were all booked solid. We were beginning to think this nightmare might continue on for days and days. Surely there had to be a carrier going to any city in the US that could accommodate us. There was. Two in fact. However Air Botswana would need to book it for us – and they flat out refused. We were only able to get on the Delta flight thanks to their management; the Air Botswana rep was never to be heard from again.

When things run smoothly, they are okay, but when you have a problem with them, they are a pure disaster. I flew with my family from Asia to Sweden, via Moscow. Even though we had more than an hour of waiting in Moscow none of our luggage arrived with us in Sweden. We reported it. Aeroflot was extremely unclear about where and when the luggage would come, and they were unable to locate it, until it, different days, arrived in Sweden. It then turned out that one of our hard Samsonite suitcases had a hole in it. It was too big to be acceptable and I therefore made a claim to Aeroflot, in accordance with their procedure. They answered me that I should send original documentation to Moscow. I did so, but was careful enough to make copies of everything. A couple of days later they just closed my claim, without any further explanations. After that I have contacted them a large number of times, making new claims referring to the original one and so forth. When they noticed that I did not give up, they tried a new strategy – to not answer. After months of waiting, I contacted them again, and actually got an answer: that they had increased their own handling time, according to the Russian law (they said), with another 30 days. Then it was silent again. Next time I contacted them they told me to make a new claim, since the first one was not treated! When I said I did not want to they referred to the Swedish Aeroflot office, which in turn told me to send the claim to them. But when the Swedish office answered to my claim it was with the information that they would not handle the case. Indeed, I have to communicate with the Moscow office, they told me. Aeroflot clearly have no intention whatsoever to give me any compensation.

,Air Botswana,Economy Class,,13th December 2010,0,0,0,Spain,4,no,Air Botswana to and from Johannesburg and Maun. The staff were friendly and outward journey JNB-Main was fine. The return journey was chaos! To start with the check-in at Maun airport was chaotic. The lounge was completely full of passengers trying to check in. Air Botswana had chartered another aircraft and upon boarding some passengers had no seats so they were told that they would have to catch the next flight. Once aboard they told us that the aircraft couldn't take our bags and that they would be in JNB on the next flight (apparently 2 hours later). I was connecting with a flight to Europe and if I had known that earlier I could have labelled my bag accordingly and I might have tried to check my bag through the whole way. I felt sorry for the staff as they were polite and tried hard to appease the passengers. They couldn't take the bags for safety reasons which is fair enough. The problem was that they knew this before we boarded the aircraft and chose to tell us once we were aboard. We flew via Gabarone to refuel. Then in Johannesburg a representative met us at the luggage carousel and told us that our bags would arrive tomorrow! At least he was there when our flight arrived and not when the supposed next flight was meant to arrive 2 hours later. However that was a bit of a shock for some of the passengers as Air Botswana must have known this in Maun.

Plenty of leg room and great adjustments on the seat, especially for leg support, but perhaps more tricky to climb out of from a window seat than the previous flight layout.

We have waited until the gates were opened to deliver our baggage and register for our boarding cards, however when we wanted to pass to the gates office to weight our baggage we were intercepted by two Air Arabia agents (one was the responsible of the flight that day and the other was controlling the documents). They refused to let us go to the gates office to deliver our baggage and they stated that our documents were not legal, the same documents that we have used to register in Brussels, our Moroccan valid passport and valid permanent residents cards. We have even double nationality, as we have the Moroccan and the Dutch nationality. When we tried to explain our case to the agents, they became aggressive and started to insult my wife in front of all passengers present in the hall.

Why are company employees working so slowly?” I want to ask one more question: ""Why do the tickets indicate only the time of boarding the plane, but there is no time to complete the registration?""

Lady on the check-in counter told me, that there is no delay of the flight, when actually it was a delay for 30 mins.

A320-214,Air Cairo,Economy Class,October 2022,30th October 2022,0,3,5,CzechRepublic,1,no,"I will forever regret not treating the bad reviews seriously before traveling with Air Cairo. Their flight from Hurghada to Prague turned out to be by far the worst traveling experience of my life. First problems arose when we were notified in Hurghada that our flight was delayed by five hours. I discovered on flightradar24.com that the reason for the delay was the plane having been diverted to Skopje on a flight from Hurghada to Belgrade earlier that day. This was our first warning sign, foreshadowing what was to come next. When we finally took off and headed to Prague, the captain announced that our flight was diverted to Leipzig, Germany due to ""bad weather"" in Prague. The crew also told us that no planes were allowed to land in Prague for this reason whatsoever. When we confronted them with the fact that we were the only plane being diverted, they suddenly changed their story and claimed that our aircraft was not suitable for landing in low visibility. When we proved this to be a lie as well, they changed their story once more and told us that the pilots were inexperienced and therefore not trained for landing in foggy weather. What the real reason for the diversion was and how their side of the story would have developed had we pushed on them further, I have no idea. When we were finally allowed to leave the aircraft in Leipzig, we received no information about future plans whatsoever and the crew simply went to bed. The staff at Leipzig Airport were unable to help us either since the only people who knew at least something about our situation were asleep. At least that is what they said. Furthermore, they denied us access to our check-in luggage in spite of some passengers being in urgent need of their medication. On the plus side, Leipzig Airport provided us with beds and blankets to survive the night, for which we were thankful. Air Cairo, on the other hand, did nothing. The following morning was a disaster as well. A substitute flight from Leipzig to Prague was scheduled first for 5:30am, then for 11:00am. However, we still had no specific information as the airport staff was unable to reach the crew and the management of Air Cairo refused to communicate with us. The airport staff claimed that the only thing for which we were waiting was the crew, who were asleep at the hotel. Yet when the management of Air Cairo finally started answering our questions, they told us that the crew were already waiting at the hotel in their uniforms, not knowing themselves why they were not able to fly. What was the reason for the waiting, then? Were we waiting for the fog in Prague to disappear? We had no idea because no one bothered to tell us. After many hours of stressful waiting, during which we were again given misinformation multiple times and several passengers burst into tears, the crew finally arrived with no further explanation at 12:45pm and we took off at 1:30pm. To sum up, our landing in Prague was delayed by 20 hours. There are, however, two aspects of our situation that are most annoying. Firstly, it was argued that our issues were caused by fog. Yet we were the only plane on that day which had this problem and dozens of other aircraft were perfectly capable of taking off and landing in Prague. The problem was therefore clearly on the side of the airline and their pilots. And secondly, what I consider even more disgraceful was the arrogance with which the airline treated us and all their deception, lies and lack of communication.",Hurghada to Prague,5,1,air-cairo,"deception, lies and lack of communication",Solo Leisure,Trip Verified,1,0,a254712b-c1ce-4d5e-95fd-0c8318b9ac2d

I contacted Travel2Be to explain the situation to them and it took them a long time to reply saying that I have one year from the date of original purchase to use my tickets or I would lose them. I then tried to fill out a refund form on Air Caraibes. The site did not work and there was no email or number to contact them. I reply to the cancellation email, once again explaining the situation and asking them if they could extend the ticket to 2021. Their answer was use it by November 2020 or lose them.

,Aeroflot Russian Airlines,Economy Class,June 2019,7th August 2019,0,0,1,UnitedStates,1,no,"New York to Tel Aviv via Moscow in June 2019. Worst experience I've had with an airline. My flight from JFK to SVO, was continually delayed by Aeroflot without explanation. Even though the boarding time was never changed, we boarded over an hour late, then were told to get off after 80 minutes sitting on the plane without any sort of communication from Aeroflot staff about what was happening. They eventually claimed that they were trying to solve ""mechanical issues"" with the plane while we continued to sit on the plane. As I later heard airport staff commenting on, I have no idea why they boarded all of the passengers when they had clearly not solved the issue to begin with. To make matters worse, despite the flight taking off from New York (with many American and English-speaking passengers on board), most of the announcements were only made in Russian. After we got off, we were told that we would need to wait for up to 3 more hours to be notified about the status of our flight. We waited for almost 2 more hours before they canceled the flight - but, in fact, they did not admit to canceling the flight - instead, they claimed to have ""delayed"" the flight for a full 24 hours! Many passengers, myself included, were upset and frustrated, but this was not the end of the complete botching of this flight by Aeroflot. They seemed to have no planned response to this scenario. They herded us all upstairs to claim our luggage, and then had us wait in obscenely long lines to check in with two Aeroflot staff members  to claim an updated ticket for the 24-hour-delayed flight and/or a hotel voucher. After already being delayed for hours, we had to wait on these lines for at least an additional 1-2 hours. The worst part of this whole disaster was that Aeroflot claimed that they were not rebooking anyone's flight because the flight had not technically been canceled, it had been delayed (according to them). Most reasonable airlines release tickets once a flight has been canceled (as this one effectively had been, clearly) so that passengers can rebook on other flights, but Aeroflot was able to get around that by ""delaying"" the flight.  The staff that were handing out the new tickets and hotel vouchers were quite rude and displayed no sympathy for customers who had been treated so poorly by the airline already (I understand they were dealing with many angry customers, but they still could have at least apologized on the behalf of the airline, which they did not). Sure enough, even though I had a program in Tel Aviv that required my presence before the ""delayed"" flight's arrival, Aeroflot would not rebook my flight. I was lucky enough to have a travel agent for this trip, and they were able to demand that Aeroflot rebook my flight to another airline after a lot of frustration on their part, requiring me to rush to another airport after a whole night of no sleep. The entire experience was handled so poorly and unprofessionally from beginning to end that I will never fly with Aeroflot again.",New York to Tel Aviv via Moscow,0,0,aeroflot-russian-airlines,handled so poorly,Solo Leisure,Trip Verified,1,0,75e0343e-cae4-415b-b022-412333fc1284

I would just like to say that the way this airline schedules this flight is a recipe for stress and disaster. A friend of mine flew the same route and had the same thing happen to her. She had given me a heads up that I would have to go from one end of the Moscow airport to the next end in order to attempt to make my flight. She also warned me that my luggage would probably not arrive. She knew this as she had taken the same route two weeks before I did. The flight from Madrid to Moscow flight 2501 arrives at 5:50 PM at terminal D. Then you have to get though security to get to terminal F in order to take flight 220 which leaves at 7:05 PM from gate 57 at terminal F, which is the second to the last gate. I literally ran from one terminal to the next and then asked the security attendant if she could take me to the front of the line in order to make my flight. If I had not ran and had not asked to be taken to the front of the line I would have missed my flight. Once I arrived in Guangzhou, I was told my luggage did not arrive and would be delivered the next day. So, why have a route so tight that will cause passenger's luggage to always arrive a day late? If the airline is going to keep this schedule, they need to at least warn passengers that their luggage will arrive late and warn them that if they want to make their connecting flight they need to RUN to make it on board.

,Air Arabia,Economy Class,August 2019,30th August 2019,1,0,1,UnitedArabEmirates,1,no,"This was probably the worst experience I've had with an airline. In hindsight, I should have opted for a full service airline even at the premium cost. Our flight was on the 22nd of August, Sharjah to Kuala Lumpur. We paid for seats up-front (in row no. 4) hoping that we'd be able to travel with others who place a premium on their peace of mind and convenience. I could not have been more wrong about this. As soon as I sat in my seat, a raucous, rowdy group of customers walked in and sat right in front of us in Rows no. 2 and 3. At first, it just looked like a bunch of young people who were flying to KL for a good time and they'd settle in after a few hours of in-flight fun. Something told me that this trip was going to be problematic, but I just chalked that up to older me nerves. Drink service started. Our merry band selected a plane load of coffee and Red Bull for dinner to go with some sandwiches that AA provided. Being an overnight flight, once service was stopped, cabin crew switched off their lights. As they say, the party started after the lights went off. The group on the left put on their reading lamps which needless to say is quite jarring and did not aid in anyone falling asleep in a 2 m radius. The group on the right seemed sober and some of them curled up to sleep. The others were high on Coffee and Red Bull so they were fully charged up.  I went up to the cabin crew and requested them to ask this bunch to simmer down. It was about midnight UAE time and it is my belief that a paying customer is entitled to his sleep during the flight. To my surprise the cabin crew shrugged and said there was nothing they could do. Apparently, this was a group of 'bloggers' who were invited by Air Arabia to review the airline or its holiday package. The cabin crew supervisor went so far as to tell me to go complain if I wanted to and they couldn't care less. The shenanigans continued late into the night and at this time, my normally docile wife spoke up. We asked them respectfully to tone it down so that we could get some sleep before our onward flight to the next destination to which we got a casual dismissal and was yelled back at. Cabin crew came to calm down the situation, which was the best they could do. After this incident, their belligerence was unfettered for the reminder of the flight. The laughing and the talking were louder and unbelievably uncivilized.  In effect, I paid additional to be harassed by a bunch of low-life thugs aided and abetted by the service provider. We were rendered powerless by an apathetic cabin crew and an airline that frankly does not give two hoots about the rights of its paying passengers.

Unfortunately, our recent trip leaves us questioning whether or not we will ever risk using their services again. If you have or have traveled with someone with, a disability, you know how important it is that boarding the aircraft be done in an organized manner. Those that have issues (health, age, children, etc) need that little extra time before regular boarding commences. It's not meant to be a free-for-all. Well, not unless you board your Aeromexico (AM) flight out of the satellite Mexico City airport, NLU (Santa Lucia). NLU is a relatively brand new airport (opened March 2022) and it appears that the AM staff has yet to be trained on basic procedures. We had 2 bad experiences in NLU. The first was flying in on the way to Veracruz and the second was the return trip out. While the first flight was total chaos, we were fortunate enough that several of the gentlemen at the front of the line saw that my husband was an amputee, etc, and immediately waved us to the front. While this was disorganized, it wasn't the mess that the return flight out of NLU was. The second flight, NLU to Guadalajara was a nightmare. There was absolutely no control over the passengers. When it was time to board, there were no zones or even basic pre-boarding. AM had a group of 20-30 who appeared to be traveling together (not young, disabled, etc) who were let on first. We were about halfway in the line. There was no Premier boarding -- one of the benefits that AM promises its passengers who pay a bit more. Nope, it was a cluster eff free-for-all. Oh, silly my. I forgot to mention not only does my 76-year-old amputee husband need the special boarding, but WE WERE also PAYING PREMIER PRICES for the early boarding. We didn't get it. So, we finally get to our seats and watched as there was no control as the passengers boarded. Several economy passengers just casually jammed their stuff in the Premier overhead bins. Result? Hubby had problems with his carry-on (which had his meds) and which came off badly scuffed. Please understand, I realize that space is limited on flights, but if you pay for certain benefits, you should get those benefits. We did not. I wrote to complain and got the stand ""too bad, so sad"" letter in return. I had asked for compensation. Of course, that's not going to happen. No, I wasn't looking for a free flight or reimbursement of our tickets. As my girl Judge Judy says, ""we ate the steak.""

Once we figured out ourselves, we were offered (by text on the website) to change date.  So in fact only the date that was affected was changeable, meaning our holiday was shortened by several weeks!

You receive error messages in code (no text, but numbers with no explanation whatsoever) for whatever you try to do. They offer no help at all.

No one is responding my call. In no way is it possible to get decent help or assistance and figuring out if everything is still in the running is all up to you to follow up your booking.

I initially chose Air Caraïbes because the flight was ridiculously cheap, only €150 for a transatlantic flight! The airport and gate were typical for a mid-sized Caribbean airport - it had what I needed, but nothing more. When I first saw the plane, I realized how brand new it looked - it was an A350-1000. Getting on board, the modern feel of the cabin was obvious. I had a seat in the very back row, but still the seat was comfortable and it had above-average legroom. It came with your usual screen equipped with a good number of entertainment options. What really caught my eye with the screens, though, was the exterior cameras. I had a middle row, so it was amazing to still be able to watch the takeoff from a tailfin-mounted camera, and now I wish every plane had that! The food was excellent, there was only one option as far as I could tell but I did really enjoy the food, yet it was simple enough that most people would like at least some portion of it. Communicating with staff went fine with the basic amount of French I know as a Canadian, and anyone who complains about them not speaking English is obviously a little self-centred and doesn't realize that this is a local Caribbean airline serving only French locations, they shouldn't have to learn English to help out the 1 American traveller on a flight. Even with all of that, all of the gate announcements and in-flight announcements were also said in English, so I don't really get how this could be much of a problem. I will say that it was unfortunate that their main website had an English page but the booking screen was only in French, but again, I don't really hold it against them and got it booked with a little help from Google Translate. If you can't handle that, just book it from Expedia or something.

On Monday October 24, Alejandro got to the airport and went to the ticket counter where he was told that the ticket had not been paid, and he’d have to pay about $436.00 for a new ticket. Not having any other recourse, and needing to get home, he reluctantly paid the exhorbitant amount that Aeromexico required. The next day, he called Aeromexico and told then that the money had been originally paid for the ticket and that he wanted a refund of the more than $400.00 that he was forced into paying. Their response was to offer to refund the $169.04 that was the original cost of the ticket. Note that offering that, indicates that they know they were paid originally and they knew how much.

Now you have to pay for luggage in the hold (£36 per item) and they are applying zero tolerance for a few grams over and weighing hand-baggage, applying limits to the letter. My excess on the same amount of luggage I’ve travelled with for years came to £129, almost doubling the price of my ticket. It was extracted by the service staff, at times barely suppressing smiles. The baggage policy – or lack of one - was among the very few positives.

The flight SVO-PEK was 1 h late in PEK as well, and I was put in Beijing in a hotel for 24 h to wait for the next Air China flight. My visit to ULN was planned as 2 days long, so I requested an Aeroflot agent to send me back to AMS, as my trip had lost its purpose. The Aeroflot Agent in Beijing spoke very poor English, and he ignored my request without a reason provided, but recommended to call to Moscow during office hours in Moscow (it was 3 am in Moscow at the time of this conversation) and discuss this with people from central office. As long as it would be too late then, and because in my experience Aeroflot client support is useless and helpless, I went to the hotel (the hotel was very poor and in a very strange location, btw). Re. inflight experience. All the Aeroflot long haul cabins I was in (A330 for AMS-SVO and B777 for SVO-PEK) were tired, did not look very clean and chairs were not the best. In contrast, both B737 for ULN-SVO and A321 for SVO-AMS were brand new and clean. Meals were very decent on AMS-SVO-AMS, decent on ULN-SVO and very unimpressive on SVO-PEK, especially a weird plastic-packed cooky before the landing that was (I suspect) designed as a breakfast. In-flight entertainment systems were broken or not very responsive both in A330 and B777.

Many people say Aeroflot are a fraud and that it’s a bad airline but these people are totally wrong since they have changed totally from their past and now it probably is the world’s most underrated airline company. The crew was amazingly polite and kind but the one of the only issues was the cabin temperature was too hot on the way home (Tokyo-Moscow) but at least they listened and did what they could to make it better unlike many other companies who would have totally ignored it. The food wasn’t the best either especially when the plane originated from Moscow but from Japan it was way way better.

Moscow to Almaty on a new Boeing 767, with personal entertainment screens and mood lighting. Staff accommodating and professional. The meal was delicious with metal cutlery. Wine and beer were complimentary (no spirits on the menu, though), and extras were served with no frowns. IFE was one of the best I experienced, no lag whatsoever. One weird thing was that the screen by design could not be adjusted when the seat in front was reclined, so the viewing angles could be uncomfortable. We were given outstanding amenity kits with neck air pillow, slippers, pen, some hand cream, eye shades and ear plugs. Different coloured kits seemed to have slightly different content, so make sure to collect them all. The crew passed the cabin with drinks several times after the meal service. Seat comfort was okay, nothing outstanding. Almaty to Delhi was on an older A321, with no personal screens. The seats were very comfortable with great seat pitch and traditional ""thick"" profile of the seats. Cabin crew were lovely and the meal was even better. There were some amenity kits given as well, except a bit smaller ones (which makes sense on a 3 hour daytime flight). You could access their entertainment via your own device and onboard wi-fi for free with no issues, and the selection was impressive, but the lack of power ports meant you will run out of power quite soon. Delhi to Almaty was practically the same as the flight from Almaty to Delhi. For Almaty - Moscow I have made a bet to upgrade on their website (the lowest amount possible), and we were upgraded to business. The flight on a Boeing 767 was wonderful with lie-flat seats, lots of privacy and space, great IFE and pleasant cabin. The cabin crew were very accommodating, greeting us with champagne as a pre-departure drink, and the purser greeted us by name, making sure we had a fantastic flight. Meals were delicious, each course was brought separately. If I could think of any improvement in business class, it would be alcohol menu, because there were just one type of champagne, one type of white and red wine (plus lots of spirits and cocktails). I believe the wine card can and should be improved. Their Bloody Mary was perfect, by the way. Almaty airport is an absolute disaster - it's small, crowded, with nowhere to sit or relax, no decent cafes, everyone is shouting at everyone. Even in business class lounge there is nothing to eat or drink for free, which is just a disgrace. Our luggage made it, and the flights were on time, though.

The airline offered no alternative transport and refused to refund the unused portion of our tickets on the spot. The counter staff told us we had to apply for a refund through our travel agent. It has been 45 days since we submitted the refund request via our travel agent and Air Caraibes has still not refunded the fares. While the ground personnel in St. Maarten were professional and polite the agents in St. Barths provided no assistance when our luggage did not arrive with us on our inbound flight (a frequent island occurence) did not answer the phone when called to inquire about the luggage the next morning and kept patrons waiting at the counter for 5 to 10 minutes while chatting amongst themselves in their office a few feet away.

First flight from Florence delayed by 3 hours, resulting in missed connection. This wouldn't have been an issue, especially considering the airline was meant to reimburse all customers for costs of the delay. However, my checked baggage was misplaced. Again, this wouldn't have been an issue under normal circumstances. I spoke to the baggage handler who told me to come talk to him prior to the next mornings flight, which was due to leave at 6am. I was forced to pay for a taxi which totalled 100 Euro each way (with promises of reimbursement) to the hotel which the company had placed passengers in only to stay there for 4 hours before having to leave again to catch the rescheduled flight. When I went to see the baggage handler I wasn't able to find anyone in the department. I went to the Air Berlin help desk and after explaining the situation to the woman at the desk she said there was nothing she could do. I asked if she was able to call the person who handled baggage as I needed to put my checked luggage on the new flight and she said she could but wasn't going to. When I asked again, saying ""Please, I need to catch my flight on time. I can't wait for someone to answer me knocking at the door, my flight leaves in less than an hour and I have to go through security"" She promptly said to me (in these exact words) ""Why don't you just do everyone a favour and go away."" I flew to my destination sans baggage and deeply offended. Being under 19 years old at the time and a solo flyer I am to this day outraged by the lack of sympathy and understanding of the customer support team. I had to wait 4 whole weeks for my luggage to arrive at my final destination.

I have travelled approximately 75-100 legs on this airline for business and have purchased several tickets to and from Moscow for both myself and my fiance. You’d think this sort of ‘loyalty’ (is it really loyalty when you consider the lack of available options?) would earn me a little more respect than what I received today, but judging from my experience with the gate agents contracted by the airline at various airports, all I seem to get is ignorance and hostility. Customer service is arguably not very highly esteemed in Central Asia in my experience so I’m long past expecting “service with a smile.” I was caught unawares today by a excess baggage fee when flying out of Dushabe. Apparently Air Astana has recently started offering bare bones fares whose limitations are in no way reflected in the pricing. These fares offer a downright insulting 1 kg baggage limit (10kg for Nomad Club Silver members) when the standard tickets allow for 20kg (30kg) respectively. I unknowingly booked this fare through a third-party website where there was no indication that this wasn’t a standard fare ticket. As I said, the ticket price wasn’t particularly cheap. I expect this sort of thing from FlyDubai or Wizz Air but from a national flagship airline? Seriously? Of course what incentive do you have to treat repeat customers well when you practically have a government-backed monopoly? And about the Nomad Club, it’s quite possibly the stingiest airline rewards program there is.

Everything ran on time. The seats are as about tight as most US airlines - though not as bad as United's back rows. But we fit fine, video was working (with lots of options for watching), food was ok-ishand the attendants were quite helpful and very nice. Really, I have no complaints. And yes, I did check in luggage on the way back - because who doesn't overshop in Italy? - and I got them back in NYC. We were all nervous about this due to all the bad review of lost luggage.

With all flights on the route being served by Aeroflot. I had only 75 minutes to change in Sheremetyevo. Why do you let the booking systems to sell the tickets with such a small time to connect. It's barely enough if the flight is on time - but, in my case, the Aeroflot flight from Copenhagen was delayed by 25 minutes. I have to say a few words about the official ground representatives of Aeroflot in Copenhagen. It was hustle and bustle, with lots of unnecessary movements. They made an impression of low professionalism. So the flight from Copenhagen departed with 25 minutes delay. The cabin crew on the flight CPH-SVO was also very hectic. I asked for a coffee and they poured me a warm liquid which barely resembles coffee. When I've told the lady about it and asked for the tea (if it's warm) I was met with very unfriendly face. The food had become very poor lately. I missed my connection to Saint Petersburg, I was rebooked for the next time, but barely had time to catch it. So if you travel via Moscow's Sheremetyevo you have to have at least two hours for the transfer. I arrived in Saint Petersburg's Pulkovo airport with the next Aeroflot's flight, but my luggage didn't, it arrived two flight later almost at midnight.

The next day I call to Pulkovo luggage service to ask about my luggage delivery, and they inform me that I will only get it from 20:00 to 8:00, at night.

A little annoying, but fine. However, the trip home was absolutely wretched lol and I cannot emphasize this enough. To start, when we arrived to check in (2 hours before boarding) there was already an announcement stating the flight was delayed by 1 hr. Once boarded we sat for an additional HOUR on the tarmac, causing us to miss our connecting flight home (amazingly the only flight of theirs that left only 15 minutes late). They re-routed us to Seattle, which meant an addition 2.5 hour layover before boarding the connecting flight. There was no offer of food or beverages even though we were missing our in-flight meal service. Once we boarded the connecting flight we AGAIN sat for 1 hour and 45 minutes in the tarmac. No offer of snacks or food. Mind you we are about 4 hours past when we should of had out meal service so we were starving.

The pathetic level of customer care was seen particularly by ""Help Desk"". I was even given an answer by staff on the desk upon asking when is the next flight ""any when!!"". There was nobody present at the desk to reserve us a Hotel even. After going around like headless chickens, I found out that the flight would be in the same evening at 5:50pm.

That the flight is actually full and we will be given 2nd priority if the passengers from connecting flight miss this connection. I even noticed that there were passengers who bought this flight on same day, were told by the staff to just ""wait and we will call you"" meaning they were not let to stand in the queue for boarding.

We had a change in our plans and I had to change my ticket to an evening flight. This particular fare allows changes for the same day with no fee and seats were available on the new flight so I logged into my reservation and changed the flight successfully.  I then tried to reserve a window seat on the new flight but noticed that only middle seats were available for free. This seemed strange since the flight was not sold out and ComfortFlex tickets allow free seating in the entire aircraft except for the exit row seats, where a charge applies. I then noticed that the only window or aisle seats available on my new flight were those at the exit row and those would involve an extra 9 Euro charge. As I'm about to proceed with the payment of this 9 Euro charge, my boyfriend informs me he will be joining me on the same flight. We book a new ticket for him and when we reach the seat map on his reservation, we can see plenty window and aisle seats available for free. We decide to call the Aegean call center to inquire why our reservations show different seats maps even though we've both purchased ComfortFlex tickets and we're traveling on the same flight. Their response was that it must be a systemic error and if we wanted, we could wait until going to the airport and request a window or an aisle seat there. If anyone of you has ever called Aegean for similar matters, you'll know that 9 out of 10 times, it's always the ""system"". It's evident that they're manipulating the availability of their seat maps to force you to pay extra fees even when you've purchased their highest economy class fare.

However, on Monday they notified us that the flight has been changed from 21.03 to 23.03 due to ""Spring flight schedule corrections"", thus completely eliminating any chance of using these Holidays for a trip. These types of corrections are definitely planned way in advance and should have been addressed BEFORE offering promotions on the dates.

Refunds that took 18 months and countless calls and e-mails to process (for flights that Aegean Airlines canceled).

Although I had checked-in online I had to join a mixed queue combining several destinations with this airline. There was one rather rude female employee who bizarrely pushed and I do mean push 6 passengers behind a yellow line. She said that the queue started behind the yellow line the people she pushed included two very frail elderly gentlemen. There was no apology from the staff member and she then allowed a group of teenagers to queue jump! I approached the foreign staff member who did not even have the manners to answer me and she then walked off. Several bag drop machines did not work and so I assisted several elderly people including an non-English speaking couple to use the machines. This was not good enough to state the obvious. I shall add that boarding was not well managed with certain passengers allowed to carry far too much luggage onto the flight. The aircraft was modern with inflight entertainment but the seats were thin and uncomfortable. There was a delay taking off and very poor communication from the crew on a very full flight. Once the flight arrived in Dublin there was no gate available for over 30 minutes the captain did not communicate this well and several Americans were worried about not making their flight on time. Disembarkation was like a rugby scrum. The luggage took a rather long time to come through in Dublin and there was little help at hand for passengers and only a few machines on which to log a complaint! This was a shambles and a poor quality experience for a rather expensive short flight. What a poor impression this creates of this Airline and indeed of Dublin.

On our flight from Chicago to Mexico City our bags were forcibly checked for being the “last to check in” even though we checked in via their app at 6am Thursday for a 12:30am Friday flight and then checked in again upon arrival at the airport at 7pm. This was the first flight to be delayed, the staff at the gate and flight attendants were beyond rude and unhelpful, and the plane ride itself was horrendous. Our flight home from Cancun to Mexico City was delayed for over an hour and we were not informed of this delay until we were supposed to be boarding, we still do not know why the plane was delayed. We had a connecting flight to make in Mexico City which we made them aware of and they promised 3 times that we would make it, Mexico City would hold the plane for us. We were told we would touch down in Mexico City at 6pm, instead we touched down at 6.37. Our connecting flight left at 6.50. We ran across the airport only to miss our connecting flight and play the game of how are we getting home. It was a struggle to find anyone in the airport in uniform who spoke enough English to understand us. Person after person just told us, we don’t speak English, sorry we can’t help you. We finally get someone to help us book a new flight that was 15 hours later. Aeromexico gave us vouchers for a hotel, transportation, and some food. Very generous, thank you. We get to the hotel they put us in to find out the hotel was booked up completely and we were going to have to wait 30 minutes to then be shuttled another 20 to a new hotel. By this time it was 12.30 in the morning and we had to be up again at 5 just to head back for our new flight. It was such a frustrating travel day. Our new flight starts boarding on time at 9am, we are so excited to be leaving and leaving on time until we sit on the plane fully boarded for 40 minutes before we even take off. Again, the flight was delayed. Out of 4 flights in total that we took on this one trip, 3 flights were delayed for at least 40 minutes.

Around 430PM the gate paged me and told me that I should not get on the plane because most likely my connecting flight would depart before we arrived. The gate agent manager said tough luck and refused my accommodation request. I opted to board and take my chances.  When we arrived my flight was still on the ground.

It was the worst airline experience I have had in about 20 years of frequent flying. Here are some key reasons: Customer Service is non-existent. No one ever answers their phone number and their online service always returns an error message. I tried for two weeks both online and on telephone with one simple request, to upgrade my seat on my return flight (in other words, pay them more money!). One night, with Expedia on the line with me, we waited on hold for 95 minutes and I finally fell asleep at 1am. Also, with one exception on return flight, every single Air Berlin person I dealt with was not only extremely poor at customer service, but even rude. One flight attendant was just mean to the person in front of me who asked if they could give them their trash. Another flight attendant was rude when I asked a simple question at the counter. Another in baggage claim area in Berlin was rude. Their seats in economy are smaller than any other airline seat I have experienced. I had an eight hour flight with the seat back in front of me literally 10 inches from my face. I am 5 feet 5 inches and my knees hit the seat in front of me the whole time. Be aware they will charge you $60-100 extra just to pick a seat - any seat, including economy - in advance of your flight. The WIFI does not work. I paid for WiFi going over and back and was never able to get on it. The flight attendants were no help whatsoever and were again rude when I inquired The worst part was that I experienced two delayed flights - one from Berlin to Salzburg and one from Berlin to Chicago. Both were handled terribly. When I arrived late in Chicago to make my connection to MSP, I literally ran to the gate and got there in time to get on the flight, but Air Berlin without my consent or knowledge had changed my flight to a flight 4 hours later instead and American Airlines would not let me get on my original flight. When I called Air Berlin to complain about this while sitting in ORD for 4 hours, I again waited on hold for 2 hours and finally decided they did not deserve any more of my time or effort in giving them feedback.

I find its hard to say I will never fly this airline again as: 1) I have to be flexible with the availability and 2) it would probably delete all options as there will most likely be unfortunate circumstances one time or another. Air Berlin is in a league of its own. The flights are usually delayed out of Budapest and not that its great, but its doable. But what I don't get is the incredible lack of communication. No one informs the 20 some passengers that the connecting flight will be there waiting. They don't at all care about the stress the passengers are in. Side note: If you are unlucky to be parked in another terminal (20 minutes left to your departure), they will not take any effort whatsoever in informing you where to go or even update the screens signalling delays. Then you're hit with a one lane open security control, again they don't care if the flight you're about to take is leaving in 5 minutes its slow. Yesterdays flight, once we got in the bus, the driver hacked this thing causing most of us to almost fall over and then once out of the bus, they refused to open the doors cause there was another group let in from another plane in the connecting terminal. Now we were running extremely late and running to the gate. All gates had the destinations show on the screen as is usually the case, except for the one going to Stockholm, so we ran up and asked and were brushed off. They tell us to go outside and what do we find? A bus parked right by the gate a plane right in front of us and one far to the right and again, nothing is marked. I mean, when you fly Ryanair or Wizz Air or any of these cheepy ones, its all marked. Why is this so difficult to figure out? Well obviously it is not, it is due to the lack of care. They think their passengers are a painful must. No communication whatsoever. All this anxiety and stress for the passengers, especially when you're taking the last flight out is unnecessary. Last time I flew them, my luggage got stuck in Berlin for 4 days. I have one more ticket in my pre-purchased pile and then that's it. Never again.

,Aeroflot Russian Airlines,Economy Class,December 2018,19th December 2018,5,4,5,Malaysia,10,yes,"Prague to Ho Chi Minh via Moscow. Having seen negative reviews, we (two adults, three kids 3-10 yo) decided to leave a review here too because we found the airline was excellent in many aspects. Check-in: no hick-up. It was opened two hours before flight, maybe due to Prague's policy, not airline. We wish the airport/airlines may consider this as we found the immigration at Prague was excruciatingly slow, almost deliberately by the staff who manned the counter. We were asked numerous questions and he perused through each passport very slowly without apparent reason. We made it to the flight a few minutes after boarding time had closed despite being number four to check-in. A few travellers were also late behind us.Thankfully Aeroflot waited for us! Our baggage were checked in all the way to Ho Chi Minh where we collected each of them safely. Food: We requested Muslim food. As the PRG-MOW was below 3 hours, special meal request could not be entertained (Aeroflot's policy). This is an aspect which the airline could improve. We came well-prepared with outside food and were not told off by the steward/ess. Orange juice was particularly nice. From MOW to SGN, we were provided with Muslim meal in a very well-presented boxes. It came with halal certification information booklet by a Russian halal authorisation agency. This is much better than the handwritten or sticker of MOML as in other airlines. Aeroflot scores highly from us for ensuring total confidence over the food that they serve. In flight magazine: They certainly have listened to complaints and we are happy to report that they have an in-flight magazine in English, in addition to the thick Russian one. Good job Aeroflot! We now have Nov and Dec 2018 issues as part of our collection! In flight entertainment: Aeroflot may have the largest selection of movies to watch in addition to excellent games for kids. They also have good selection of local (Soviet and Russian) hits. Every passenger was supplied with earphones. The quality of the screen and audio was excellent. 5. For kids, they received two different sets of bag/toy/stationeries/games for the two legs of travel. Very nice bag that my youngest keeps wearing everyday even after a week off the plane! Very nice touch from the Aeroflot! 6. Cabin crew were polite and gentle enough throughout the flight, at check in counter and when speaking with the kids. Amenities on board were also good including blanket, socks, soft slippers and eyemask on the MOW-SGN. Overall cabin experience was great. The flight was warm, clean and spacious enough with reclining seats, and lift-able armrest, allowing my kids to sleep on my laps. Overall Moscow Sheremetyevo experience was excellent. Immigration was polite and quick. Airport facilities were great. There is even a family room at Terminal D which could be booked for free to up to 24hrs by a family that has at least one <7 yo. It has beds for small kids and sofas for older ones, a playing room, nappy changing room, basic kitchen (for warming baby foods and hot water) and private toilet. It is manned by a personnel who just need to be shown the passports and boarding passes. We used 12 flights for this particular trip, and Aeroflot scored highest. It was a positive experience for all of us. We were not expecting this as the price was unbelievably low for PRG-SGN (below MYR1000 per person).

Boarding took quite a while, but once we got underway the flight was enjoyable. The crew were pleasant and spoke basic English. The 2 meal services were efficient and the food wasn't bad at all. Only negative is that alcoholic drinks aren't served on domestic flights (even though it was 8.5hrs long). The IFE had a decent selection of Western films in English and the sound quality was very good, particularly compared to that on some of Aeroflot's other aircraft.

Seats were comfortable and flight attendants professional and efficient. On board sky sales were relatively affordable but I did not notice any major brand names. Interesting boarding and seating announcements were started while passengers were boarding rather than after the doors had closed. I thought this was a good use of crew time.

It started with the check-in where  tired passengers had to wait in the bus, while tiny batches of people were allowed to check in. Once we got off the bus we had, additionally to our already four hour wait at the airport, wait again for half an hour to get our room cards. Three hours before check-in I already knew that I'd be staying in Novotel, how come they were not prepared and just handed over the keys. What terrible logistics!!

Once I went to this reception, the chap didn't even understand what I wanted. So together we called 75 and now they delivered.

I was waiting for over an hour before I got to the counter. I asked for a window and got a middle seat (they said they had no more windows). I had to wait five minutes before someone could print me out a new boarding pass and eventually I got an aisle seat. I went to clear immigration and was told once i had had my passport stamped that I needed to pay 200Syrian pounds airport tax (mentioned nowhere even at check-in). I had to go back through security to buy the tax then go back airside and push my way through to the front of the immigration queue (I had been queuing at check- in so long the flight was boarding).

I perfectly understand that operational matters can ground aircraft which according to Aer Lingus was the case with EI564 on the 25th June. However the manner with which a cancellation took place showed neither respect or care for customers. Notification of the cancellation arrived on my cellphone 3 hours and 30 minutes from departure. This did not allow me time to make any alternative arrangement.  If you are dropping a bag arrive 3.5 hours before departure. Informing me on the way to a chaotic airport in free fall did not allow for this. The lack of joined up thinking is disgraceful. The alternative given to me was a pitiful attempt to retrieve a bad situation Aer Lingus offered this rerouting alternative. Dublin to LHR 1400 on the 26th June.

The lady at the desk was not able to change the error and had to call another flight attendant to fix the boarding passes but instead of checking my son/daughter out again they checked us in additionally without matching the luggage tags/tickets to our names/boarding passes. Long story short the luggage was unloaded since my daughter/son did not travel with us. During the flight the flight attendant forgot our row to pass out drinks and when I asked her politely if I was able to get a drink, she was angry and extremely rude telling me to get back to my seat and wait my turn. She then ran after me yelling to give her the seat number which made me lose my desire to get something to drink. However, I had a terrible headache, the flight was 10 hours long and I did need some water which I eventual got. She did apologize blaming her Irish accent for the misunderstanding however I have Irish friends and I know the difference between simply being rude or just having a charming accent. We also never got any blankets on the flight, and I was afraid to ask since I knew it would trigger another rude reply from her. Needless to say, we all will avoid this airline in the future.

,Air Berlin,Business Class,April 2017,10th April 2017,1,1,1,DominicanRepublic,1,no,"New York JFK to Duesseldorf. The worst service in a business class cabin I've received. There was nothing that I could say positive about this flight 7481 of Air Berlin departing April 8 from JFK to Dusseldorf. Arrived at JFK with more than 3 hours in advance. There were people in the priority /business line waiting because the two staff that attended the site, were gone for a break , and no other attendance paid attention to us. Suddenly another travelers that arrived after us were allowed to go through, and when I complained, a very young man responded that they were attending first the Berlin passengers (was no way this gentleman could know, without asking, whether I was going also to Berlin?) When we arrived at the time of boarding (we were told at the counter that there was going to be a 25 minutes delay), we had to wait for an hour without anybody explaining what was going on. We later found out that they had to switch the aircraft, and make the catering. When we finally boarded, never were we were approached by our names, I had to wear my jacket, since nobody came to ask for it. Food (bad catering), but that was not all. My dinner selection was Rissotto with a pinot grigio the staff brought me the rissotto  with a red wine when I told her that that was not my wine, and that I order the grigio, I think I spoke in esperanto, since she had no idea what I was talking about: I said white wine, and she said ok, and she never came back with the wine. Tire of waiting, I sipped a horrible red wine, and my wife took it and changed it for a chardonnay she was having. Dessert with the whole tray occupied with the other plates. The cabin was a mess, the flight staff spent the flight running, coming and going, and that is the reason why I did not have the chance to request for some better treatment. My only comfort was that this was a 6 hours flight. At the end, when we were to land the flight attendant asked me to put my jacket back since I couldn't have it in my hands.

Boeing 737-800,Aeroflot Russian Airlines,Economy Class,August 2018,8th August 2018,2,3,3,RussianFederation,4,no,"Moscow to Istanbul. Aeroflot is definitely not a premium airline it thinks it is, because their economy experience is simply embarrassing. Moscow - Istanbul was on a 5-year old Boeing 737-800, but the cabin looked like it was 15 years old with no maintenance. Everything was scuffed, slightly teared, shaky etc. The seats were unbelievably, and I mean it, unbelievably tight. It was seriously painful to sit upright in the seat, because if you are of average height, your knees will be firmly pressed into the hard and rough metal bar, which is conveniently located right where your knees are supposed to be. The fact that the armrests were quite wide made the seat even less spacious. I lucked out in not having a neighbour in the next seat, but I seriously doubt it I would have handled the flight if it was 100% full. The cabin crew were grumpy and sloppy (with one exception), and their attitude regarding safety was unbelievable - they just didn't care. They never properly checked the cabin before take off and failed to enforce the safety rules (since they cared so little), so the plane took off with open tray tables, closed windows, passengers laying across the seats with no seatbelts, passengers streaming something from their devices with no headphones. I have never experienced anything like this, I felt like this was a bad dream or a good comedy, but it was neither. The meal service was alright. I ordered a kosher meal, which is always a fine choice on Aeroflot, and it was much bigger than the regular meals. Nothing extraordinary, plastic cutlery, no menus, but it was fine. There was no wine, beer or any other alcohol onboard, not even for purchase, which is just so embarrassing for the ""best airline of Eastern Europe"". I must also note that their main full-service competitors on this route - Turkish Airlines and Atlasglobal - both serve beer and wine, and their meals are much tastier. There was no entertainment onboard. You could apparently stream entertainment via their wi-fi network, but it kept failing. The landing in Istanbul was really rough, and then the plane spent 20 minutes slowly driving through the airport. The passengers thought it was a great time to stand up, open the overhead bins, start packing while the plane was in motion and something could easily fall down on someone's head, and the crew did nothing to stop it. So, once again, major safety hazard. Istanbul-Moscow was another story. It was Boeing 737-800 with the same seating chart, but the plane was newer, and the seats were better. Their design allowed for more legroom, and while it still wasn't spacious, it was tolerable. I still don't get why they decided to have a magazine pocket at the top of the seat (which is a great idea for maximising legroom) and at the knee level as well, because that doesn't make any sense from any perspective and shows poor management, but at least there were no metal bars this time. The seats felt super flimsy and cheap, though, with the whole row shaking and creaking whenever someone moved. I wonder if this plane will age well, because it seems like it will not. Cabin crew were much more pleasant this time around, and they actually made sure the people were seated with their seatbelts on. No wine or beer once again. The kosher meal was exactly the same, which was fine. The flight was delayed for 30 minutes with no explanation or apology.

I resent the imposition on my time. The seats were slanted and I slid off the seat while trying to sleep on it. I may have gotten two hours of sleep on a seven hour flight.

,Aeromexico,Economy Class,August 2021,10th September 2021,1,1,1,Canada,1,no,"My partner and I had our first flight with Aeromexico from Amsterdam to Mexico city and then to Puerto Vallarta on 18-19/Aug. There were delays (30-60min.) and the cabin crew was rude and unaccommodating. We don't speak Spanish and it was obvious that they had a problem with that. Especially one lady who was really nice to all Spanish speaking passengers but when I asked her something I got just one word answer in a really impolite way. Another flight with Aeromexico was supposed to be from Puerto Vallarta to Mexico City and from there to Vancouver on 25/Aug. As the first flight got delay almost 3 hours we weren't able to catch our second flight. Lady at the PV airport was unhelpful, and after we approached her, she told us that we had just 2 options. Stay one more night and take the same route next day, or take the first flight to Mexico city and wait there for the second flight to Vancouver till next day. We've been told that it wasn't Aeromexico's fault therefore they won't provide us hotel or meals. After we got out, to our surprise our original flight to Vancouver just began boarding right at the next gate. We happily get there to realize that we can not get in. Why? Nobody knows again. At first they told us because of ""weight and balance"" after that because they didn't have available seats and so on. It was two of us and another 15-20 people including families with small children who weren't able to get in. We were trying to understand this situation but after 30 minutes no reasonable explanation came. We accepted vouchers for hotel and meals as at the airport in Mexico city miraculously could provide them. Next day after we got back to the airport we were trying to get confirmation about the flight delay as we supposed to be already in the work in that time but we were stuck in Mexico. Of course customer service at the airport was as bad as the lady at our first flight so we got nothing. Finally 50 minutes after our flight was scheduled we were finally boarding, still not sure if we can get in this time. We got in and after almost an hour we started rolling and captain is speaking to us. Unfortunately we had to have a stop in Tijuana to get fuel. In the end this flight had 3 hours delay (+24 hours). I never heard sorry or any kind of apology till this moment. One more thing, after we got vouchers for meals and hotel we've been told that we can catch Aeromexico shuttle in front of the T2 gate which take us to the hotel. We've been there for almost 30 min. and what we've seen was just shuttle for crew. At the hotel we've learned that we should have vouchers for taxi too but we didn't have them so we paid 2 fairs with taxi by ourselves.

I consider myself pretty easy going but Aeromexico really put my nerves to the test. I will just make a list: -My luggage was broken into and my jewellery stolen during my 5 hour layover in Mexico City on my way to Los Cabos. I reached out to the complaints department but not surprisingly no one has responded (weeks later). Upon my return to Toronto, I once again had a short layover for 2 hours in Mexico City. While lining up at the gate to get on the aircraft, the staff closed the door while 15 passengers remained behind standing, me and my family included. it was stressful, messy and confusing and the staff said nothing to us about what was happening, they just pointed a finger for us to go to customer service. That's when we discovered we had been bumped off our flight for the next 24 hours and they couldn't even guarantee us that we wouldn't be bumped again the next day. The customer service rep. explained that we couldn't go on the flight because of weight/balance issues, and that's when my husband and I came to the conclusion that passengers are being kicked off the flight in order to make room for more lucrative cargo. We collected our luggage for the 24 hour delay because after my initial experience, we did not trust our luggage sitting in the Airport with out them being rummaged through and items stolen. When we received our luggage, my bag was heavily damaged and a wheel completed ripped off so I could barely manage rolling it around the airport and to our hotel. The next day we checked in 3 hours before our flight because we wanted to avoid any issues. The line up at the gate was a crowded mess, it felt like I was going to get trampled on. Once seated and on the plane the crew made an announcement that a few passengers would not be coming on the plane again and that their luggage needed to be removed from the plane. So the airline was again doing to others what we experienced the day before. At that point, the passenger sitting behind me told the flight attendant that she just saw the ground crew taking her bag off the plane even though she was still on it, at which point the flight attendant left for a couple minutes and when he came back the plane just started to pull out and he said there was nothing he could do about it at this point. Once we arrived in Toronto Pearson Airport, and made it through customs, my husband and I discovered that our luggage was also taken off the plane in Mexico City. After filling out the necessary paperwork, the Aeromexico luggage attendant informed us that we should have our luggage delivered to us no later than Tuesday September 7th. It has been 4 days now since we landed, with multiple phone calls and emails made on my part, no one from Aeromexico has contacted us about its whereabouts. And after having my personal items stolen out of my luggage on my 5 hour layover in Mexico City, I can only imagine what I will or will not have left in my luggage if Aeromexico ever returns our luggage to us. However, my daughters luggage WAS on the plane, and upon returning home she discovered she still had all her items in her bag but she also had extra items. Shirts and skirts that did not belong to her, which means the baggage staff at Aeromexico is opening peoples luggage to look for valuables and is just stuffing personal items back haphazardly in random suitcases.

I had to contact them and they told me the bag was on the way to Dublin, so I went to the airport to collect the baggage. On the spot, I had to wait 4,5 hours until someone helped me, there was a huge shortage of staff and no one could help me. In the end, it turned out that the bag wasn't even there and that I had wasted my time. They told me that ""the fact that the bag has been loaded onto the plane doesn't mean that it will arrive"". A week later they finally called me to say that my bag would arrive in Berlin on the next day. To my question if they would deliver the bag to my address, the least they could do to compensate for this nightmare, they said it depended on how much work there would be at the airport in Berlin.

A330,Aer Lingus,Economy Class,May 2022,5th June 2022,1,1,1,UnitedStates,1,no,"I am a mother traveling alone with my infant son, and Aer Lingus has made our experience an absolute nightmare. I called to request a bassinet seat for my baby to be able to sleep on the 7 hour flight from Chicago to Dublin (8 hours on the way back), and I was told to contact Special Assistance through their website, which I did. I was then told via email that I was assigned row 30 on flight EI122, and was told this was a bassinet row. When I boarded the plane (which was two hours delayed), I arrived at my seat, baby in my arms, to discover that row 30 is a bulkhead row but nota bassinet row. The only bassinet row on the aircraft I was on is row 9. The flight attendants told me not much could be done, but finally we begged to switch with someone in row 9 and someone was kind enough to do it. However, I had to move back before landing so that the original passenger in row 9 could alight the plane first, so had to lug myself, my infant son, and all our stuff back and forth three separate times.  While onboard my flight to Chicago, I discovered eventually that my seat's media system was broken, the remote for it did not work, so that even though the screen seemed to be fine, I could not control anything/make anything play on it. This meant I could not watch anything, could not listen to anything, could not even call the flight attendant, turn on my own light. When I was finally able to alert a flight attendant and let them know, they brushed me off and said they would make a note of it, offering nothing else to help or compensate. I had no media available to me after I was able to get my baby to sleep in the bassinet they provided, which, by the way, is a beat up cardboard box lined with airline pillows, and airline blanket, and strapped in with straps that go above the baby's feet and right above the baby's head. Far from a nice set up. On the day before my original flight back from Dublin to Chicago, I tested positive for Covid 19. While I've been asymptomatic, I understand that the US requires negative tests to re-enter the country, and while it was an unfortunate situation, I anticipated being able to handle it. I did not  anticipate that Aer Lingus would have no policy for dealing with this kind of a situation. I once again waited on hold with them for over an hour to be told that in a situation like this, all they can offer is for you to change your flight for a large sum of money (over 450 euro in my case). They offer no flexibility which is impossible for a situation like this one. I can't imagine I am the only one (I'm probably one of hundreds if not thousands) who is having to reschedule their flight because they will not be let into the country due to unexpected test results. But Aer Lingus offer no sort of flight credit or flexibility, even though I have no way of knowing when I will test negative and be let back into the US. It could be in two days time, it could be in twenty days time, and Aer Lingus only seeks to make you change your flight over and over again, charging you more and more money each time, even though this is something completely out of the passenger's control. I finally booked a flight seven days away, and just hoped and prayed I would be negative by then, also knowing I would miss a good amount of work and income by being out of the country",Chicago to Dublin,1,1,aer-lingus,made our experience an absolute nightmare,Family Leisure,Trip Verified,1,1,4ec773de-fc3f-4292-906f-a7b0cd5673a6

A320,Air Berlin,Economy Class,February 2017,23rd February 2017,2,1,4,Germany,8,yes,"Berlin Tegel to Bucharest. I would start my review with the regret that Air Berlin has stopped flying to Bucharest and those were one of the last flights operated by them. I know it is tough to keep pace with Ryanair but since Air Berlin has moved towards a quality service experience for its customers, maybe it would have been nice to get this experience on this route too. I must say that since I fly Air Berlin (and that is a lot of time) I only had once or twice that my flight was delayed. And those flights to/from Bucharest were both ahead of schedule. I have read it is not always the case but from my experience and point of view, I was really impressed to see so many flights on time. The aircrafts they are flying are new (I suppose the kept only the new ones in their fleet after the restructuring last year) and as a topbonus platinum I always get a seat with extra leg-room which makes flying with them a joyful experience. There are some things that are disturbing: the inflight entertainment system only shows ads of Air Berlin and their partners together with their destinations, over and over again. This becomes too much after some time and they never change. They have an App which you can use on your own device for WiFi and entertainment, but for my surprise you had to pay for watching TV-Series as well, not only for using the WiFi. They are many airlines which offer this service for free. Another thing that I find not right are the prices for the in-flight snacks and drinks. I understand that this is a new market strategy (is it really part of that high quality experience they are talking about?) but there are operators offering decent prices, not 3,5€ for a mineral water. And the coffee was really bad: a bag exactly like tea infused in hot water. I would expect more quality from their famous ""signature"" coffee. I think things are changing and the airline looks better like it used to be some years ago. The cabin crew members are more friendly but there is still much to do. Many people say it has the corporation mentality and they attention for client is low and that is partially true. I think being closer to the client in any way will make this airline better.",Berlin to Bucharest,5,4,air-berlin,the airline looks better,Solo Leisure,,3,1,050c3fc8-215e-408e-b32d-38ad4c993879

I did a few flights with them with a few minor problems (delayed flights, delayed luggage) I kept using them as I had already a bunch of miles and a gold status, but the last one was very bad and is the last drop. Connecting in Berlin will require you to change terminals by walking outside and going over security again. Their lounges are so bad that are almost always worse than the comparable regular waiting areas from better airlines. A lot of their web site is not working, specially if you are accesing it from outside of Germany. Their phone app is buggy and of very limited functionality. It is very hard to get hold of them on the phone, you have to navigate a maze of menus to get there and then wait for long periods of time. Their phone service is very fragmented, once I get to talk with someone it often happens that he or she can not do what I need and I need to call again. My average has been four calls to get anything done this is in total with waiting and menu navigation about 45 minutes. Their phone service is not 24 hours, if you are in a different time zone than Germany you may have to actually wake up in the middle of the night to call. It is practically impossible to make use of miles for flight upgrades in their own flights. It is effectively impossible to use their miles to upgrade or buy any service from other airlines on the network. Booking an award fligh on their own flights requires you to call them, again, this is difficult you cannot do it online. My last return flight was cancelled and I arrived with a 12 hour delay back home, losing a whole work day they didn't offer lounge access during my 12 hour wait at the San Francisco airport.

Asked at the check in for a emergency exit row-seat they wanted to charge me 39EUR what is unjustifiable towards clients of my height. So I spent three hours standing in front of the toilets to avoid pain. This was the first and last time I've booked Air Berlin.

The seating in our plane (AB7446 on Jan 4th 2016) was NOT the one shown on any seating map we could find (not even Air Berlin's). Identical staggered cubicles but inverted window/aisle positions. E.g. second row had 02A (window) and not 02C (aisle), third row had 03C and not 03A and so on. Reason why you won't find my 03C on those maps. Seats are horribly narrow and not long enough in the flat position (I m 184 cm tall, you won't be comfortable lying if you are taller than 170 cm, I tend to think), the reading lamp not usable (light beam never illuminates your book page since there is no flexible support/stem like many airlines offer), and almost no room to put your belongings. Okay for day flight in the seating position. Obviously those seats are not keeping Air Berlin's attractive promises (see their website). They should be changed. These seats are light years away from Qatar Airways Boeing 773-ER's and 772-LR's heavenly comfort). I did not use the IFE unless to track the route. So no idea of IFE's value but it offers a wonderful large screen and terrific high definition for the route tracker. I did not use the connectivity either, unless to charge my tablet battery but there are various sockets available (including USB). Drinks generally OK, real Champagne being an asset. Lunch food was nothing fancy but generally okay, snacks not so okay. Excellent service by highly motivated and attentive flight attendants as well as remarkably professional and kind check-in agent. Amenity kit included slippers, a definite asset as far as hygiene is concerned. Cabin was clean. No separate business class counter during ""night before check-in"" service!

Aeroflot apparently introduced a new dedicated counter for Business Class. So now they process separately Business class, Sky Priority and Economy passengers at the check in. Which might be a good idea at the main Aeroflot airports. However, in Prague it creates a lot of problems, confusions and discomfort. In the past, there was just common Business Class/Sky Priority counter and two for Economy. In this particular case, they checked in all 4 Business class passengers at one counter, 10 SkyPriority passengers at the other counter and all the remaining approx. 150 people at the single, remaining counter. In the past, they had two counters for economy, serving on average. 75 people each. Consequently, the new regime effectively doubled queues (and check in time) for economy passengers, but offered only a very little or no extra comfort for business passengers. Moreover, it disturbed the whole process, because people waiting in a very long queue were continuously trying to sneak in into SkyPriority. It is odd to see one clerk doing nothing and the other being up to their ears in work.

It can be a delightful experience or it could be a disaster, although I must say that in the last year you can feel some change inside the management and the service is improving and becoming good, therefore I trust them and give them 10 points for the change they are developing. Some might say that paying for the snacks and drinks it is a downside but I do think that for flights shorter then 2h you really don't need all these. The prices they offer are OK and the quality of the products has improved. You still get the chocolate heart when exiting the aircraft. The planes they got after the restructuring are in very good shape. Not mentioning that the flights are almost all the time landing on time or even before schedule. It is still very difficult to use their website in order to buy tickets and this needs improvement. The mobile apps are sometimes too long under maintenance and you cannot use all the features, but at least people are well informed about it.

This was the first time that we had flown Air Astana and we were generally pretty impressed. Not quite up to the standard of the top Airlines but worth their 4 star Skytrax status. Outbound the meal was one of the best I've experienced in the air; with multiple courses presented separately and the food options varied and delicious. Inbound was another matter however with tasteless cold fish chicken that was a bit dry and less attractive options. Maybe the Caterer in Astana isn't as good as in London. Service both ways however was excellent with pre take-off drinks offered boiled sweets hot face towels drinks and nuts or canapés and very attentive staff. The seats were pretty comfy and whilst not fully flat (hopefully their Dreamliners on order will have fully flat seats in Business) they still had very decent recline and allowed for some sleep. (we were on a 757 for all sectors so if you get this aircraft type or a 767 on Domestic sectors then you're doing pretty well in Business Class for such a short flight - nothing like the terrible Business Class European Airlines offer on short haul flights). The Etihad Lounge at Heathrow was excellent; and it's very quiet at the time that Air Astana fly as there are no Etihad flights at this time however the Lounge in the Domestic Terminal at Almaty is really an embarrassment (small pokey room no natural light small snack counter charging for everything right down to a cup of tea!). Air Astana hand out tablets in Business Class as there are no seat back TV's. We found that we could hardly hear through the headphones on the way out but this was much better on the way back. The Moving Map however wasn't working on the way back and since the tablets aren't connected to the flight systems at all we had no idea where we were or how long until arrival for the whole flight. (even Economy Class presumably can access this info). Other minor irritations were the same 2 songs played continuously on loop when the aircraft is on the ground and the lovely new anti jet lag ceiling lighting system being inexplicably put through it's paces for the first few hours of the flight jumping between colours every few seconds. Terminal 4 at Heathrow was relatively quiet at the times Air Astana flew which made for a pleasant experience; and I can recommend Terminal 4 Long Stay Parking which is actually just across the main road from the Terminal - no more than 5 minutes in the shuttle bus!

Whilst on my first call, the girl I talked to told me that I needed to pay 100euros for the change whereas the next day I was told to pay 140euros for the same change (Note: The flight rate didn't change at all). Despite the difference, I changed my flight ticket asking for a baggage too. They booked my ticket without adding a baggage! I called yesterday to ask what happened and they were telling me that there was no charge for the baggage. Then, they told me they would listen to my recording and call me back. They called me two hours later the phone was ringing for 5 secs and I did not manage to pick it up. I called back and I was told that the girl who was assisting me finished her work for the day.

I checked the COVID test requirements for Canada (my final destination) in the days leading to my flight and read that I needed to have a negative PCR done within 72 hours of flying. This I did 2 days pre-flight. When I arrived at the airport at 8:00AM, the Aer Lingus check in staff queried my COVID certificate, but I told her that my final destination was Canada, not US, and I was told that my COVID certificate was then ""fine"". My baggage was checked in, I got through security, US customs and border protection, and all the way I proceeded to the boarding gate. When I approached the boarding gate staff at 10:40AM, I was asked to fill out a form for US clearance stating that I had a negative test within the last 24 hours. I couldn’t sign this and told the ground attendant that my final destination was Canada. He told me to wait aside. After all the other passengers have been boarded, he told me that I could not board the flight to New York since I didn’t have a negative test taken within the previous 24 hours. At that stage, it was then too late for me to get an antigen test. The other ground attendant told me the luggage would be off-loaded and I will have to collect them in carousel 6. He tried to rebook my flight, but since I had booked with Trip.com, he said I should contact the travel agency as he couldn’t change it. I was escorted to the exit leading to baggage reclaim and told “You know if you hadn’t said anything, we would have never noticed it. That’s what you get for being so honest.” I contacted Trip.com and the rep said she will forward an urgent flight change request to Aer Lingus. I then got an email stating “the airline said that according to the policy they cannot operate the change. Your ticket is non-changeable after departure, it is all up to the airline company.” At that stage, my options being extremely limited, I rebooked my flights to Calgary at a cost of 644 euro plus I had to get another PCR test for 69 euro. I managed to fly next day but to add insult to injury, all the luggage that I paid for went missing and did not arrive with me.  If I had been told at check-in on my original flight that my COVID cert was invalid for the US, and if my luggage had not been checked through, I would have had time to get a negative antigen test, I wouldn’t have been denied boarding and wouldn’t have incurred the extra expense (644 euro flight + 69 euro PCT test).  I have written to Aer Lingus and they initially ""offered"" to refund the flight. However, that also seemed to be the end of the conversation from them. I submitted multiple follow-up requests using their case update portal but haven't received a single response since then. Trip.com will refund me but they cannot proceed as Aer Lingus has not refunded them yet. What happened to me was an avoidable mistake by the ground attendants at the airport.

I left my location 3 hours before my flight departure just to be told on arrival that my flight gate closed an hour before which is odd but fair enough, they can make their own rules. My issue is that on the check-in site via Aeromexico, they don’t tell you what time boarding starts. If I knew what time boarding starts, I would’ve been on time without a doubt. I have never missed a flight in my entire 25 years of living because I’m extremely punctual and Aeromexico better hope I get compensated for this hot mess they call an airline.",Cancun to New York JFK,1,2,aeromexico,has to start communicating better,Solo Leisure,Trip Verified,1,1,79aa3742-381e-41fc-b7f3-54b871da7739

I would have to book by April 30, 2021 and fly by Nov 30, 2021. I have been trying to get these tickets rebook for a couple of weeks. Yesterday I was transfer or put on hold five times and each time the calls were dropped and long wait times. What I did find out is they have no flight from Cleveland nor are they flying into Cozumel. They are only flying from Pittsburgh or Buffalo to Cancun MX. What this means is we now have to drive to Pittsburgh or Buffalo then when we arrive in Cancun, we have to hire a van to transport us 1 hour to Playa del Carmen then again pay for a 1-hour ferry ride to Cozumel. Then repeat the process to get back. To top it off while we paid $431.33 for the original ticket.

I'll have to start with the fact that they let you have a checked in bag which weighs up to a certain amount of kilos for free, which as far as I'm concerned is not the case for many airlines. Flight was initially delayed by half an hour or so which for me wasn't a lot as I didn't have any connecting flights to worry about, but I understand that for some people this might not be the case. Boarding was done via jetbridge and was rather fast considering the flight was full. We boarded the plane, but didn't take off for nearly another two hours due to a thunderstorm over the airport. The seats were very comfortable for Economy class, but again I'm only 1.62 so my opinion on this probably isn't relevant. The pilots made an announcement straight away and the flight attendants handed out free drinks to everyone during the time we spent on the ground. The pilots kept informing us of the situation and when we finally took off the flight was extremely turbulent, but they handled the situation pretty well I must say. A free hot meal was provided for all passengers, both Bussiness and Economy class which is very rare these days for an intra-european flight. When we arrived in Athens the pilots made an apology for the delay and announced that every passenger who had missed their connecting flight would be offered either a free rebooking or a voucher but I can't remember exactly, as I didn't need one. Luggage came out quickly and it wasn't damaged in any way. The price was ok but considering their excellent service I can't even think about complaining about the price. The only thing that I didn't quite like was the fact that there was no in flight entertaining as there were no screens which having flown on their A320s as well I know are present there, but not in the A321, but again, I'm not complaining.

I think Aeromexico are downright scammers, it really is a shame that they are members of Skyteam. A few facts: - I paid €3300 for tickets, which were converted into a credit in Russian Rubles without my knowledge so that they are now only worth €2600. Aeromexico filed for bankruptcy (Chapter 11) in July 2020, so they do not have to refund people who booked before that time. They don't refund money, to any one. You will automatically receive vouchers, but you have to pay a service fee if you subsequently want to book a ticket. I have vouchers for 4 people, which cannot be exchanged for 1 person. You must therefore go on holiday with a group that you would go with 1.5 years ago.

In July of 2020 I bought a round-trip ticket London-Cancun for a friend for travel in August. Three days later they cancelled their London-Mexico City flights for the entire month of August. I called to find an alternative, but they couldn't offer me anything, save for travel credit. When I said I wanted a refund, the agent said I'd have to write to a dedicated email address. The email was returned as undeliverable, so I opened a dispute through my credit card, figuring I'd get my money back that way. AeroMexico objected to the dispute, saying my fare was non-refundable they said I had credit to use within a year, minus a $200 no-show fee. A no-show fee for a cancelled flight. When I finally fixed the problem with their email address, they said that since I bought the ticket through a third party vendor (in this case Orbitz) I'd have to get the refund through them. Orbitz was helpful, but said they still had to go through AeroMexico for their approval before issuing a refund. Months went by, and all Orbitz could say was that the airlines are very slow these days and AeroMexico was not responding. So they have the manpower to object to my credit card dispute and keep my money, just not the manpower to approve my refund. I wrote to them several times about this discrepancy, but they never addressed that issue, just repeating I'd have to go through Orbitz. Let me add, I tried to be understanding. I can see that the airlines are strapped. I said I would accept credit in place of a refund if I could change the name of the passenger (which the rules disallow remember I got this for a friend) and if the credit were not time restricted (which, so far as I can see, just helps them out even more). They said they could not do that because their policies do not allow it. Of course, their policies are under their control.

Other than this, several other experiences have negatively affected my opinion. Recently my girlfriends bags were lost by Air Berlin (for the second time), and they promised she would get a refund for everything. We even called the support to make sure. However, all she got was a coupon to use when booking flights through the AB website. The value of the coupon was 1/3 of what the clothes cost. As for my personal experiences, a few months ago I missed a connecting flight because of the first flight was delayed.

The segments from Abu Dhabi were operated by Etihad Airways and the rest was operated by Air Berlin. Checked in online, but when we arrived at the airport we found out, that our seats from Abu Dhabi to Phuket had been reassigned to other passengers. Reason was, that Air Berlin can not access the Etihad Airways booking system. Hence our boarding passes were invalid and we did not get any window seats any more. Apart from that however, check in procedures were smooth and seamless. Air Berlin offers their XL seats (economy seats with more legroom) for free to their frequent flyers and I have to say, that I love them. They are exactly what I was looking after. I do not need any premium economy product where the food is the same but only presented differently. I get extra baggage allowance and other benefits from my frequent flyer status. So the extra legroom is really valuable to me. Even if I didn't get it for free, I would be more than willing to pay those 79€. The extra space allows you to stretch your legs and to find comfortable and relaxing position for a long haul flight. Boarding was done in an efficient way and we were able to take off on time. Pillows and blankets were distributed in advance, whereas the amenity kits (toothbrush, sleeping mask, ear plugs) were distributed after we were airborne.

Especially red eye flights are unbearably boring without IFE. I was expecting to come back home in the same way but No! I supposed to leave Berlin on 1st of December 11 pm and but our flight was delayed for 18 hours at first. It was due to bad weather in Moscow according to the airline representative.

The weather was bad, so after two scary attempts to land us in Boston, they landed us in a small airport in Hartford, CT instead. This is fine-being safe. Once there, they sent a representative to talk to us. They were going to bus us to Boston, MA, which would mean my connecting flight to Raleigh would be missed (I had booked this separately). I spoke to their representative numerous times. (Oh and they had lost one piece of my luggage too, which they were able to find a few days later). The plan from Aer Lingus was to bus us to Boston and we would arrive between 1 and 2 in the morning. We were told that the airport would then be closed, but we might be able to get a cab to a nearby hotel, but they were not sure if any were running. Their plan was to dump us outside of Boston Airport at 1 or 2 in the morning. Remember, this is after 2 extremely turbulent attempted landings and a diversion to a different airport. I asked if they could put us up in the Hartford Airport hotel instead. I was told yes and that I would be reimbursed, but the fastest way was to pay it myself and ask for reimbursement later. I also asked about having to rebook my connecting flight that was missed, and was told yes, it would be reimbursed. I was lucky enough to have enough to pay for an unexpected hotel and extra flight, but not everyone may have been so lucky. I filed a request for a reimbursement through Aer Lingus website as told to do. It took over a month for a response and was told that they could not help me because I showed them bank statements and no the original receipts. I got the original receipts and sent them in. I was denied at that point because ""there responsibility was to get me to Boston, not to pay for connecting flights or hotels.""

The seat itself was very comfortable and the adjustments were easy to operate. Following a welcome Champagne drink and hot towel, the menus were handed out.

For dinner,  small appetisers were served, followed by a seafood starter, salad and hot breads. The main fish course was OK but a little bland. However, a desert trolley came along and I was able to choose what I liked, and settled for cheese/crackers and ice cream. Plenty to eat, but not that great. The wine served was good, and topped up several times, before coffee and cognac. One of the crew came to apologise for the lack of choice in the food, but it was not a major issue. What impressed me was the smiling and attentive attitude of the crew. I have read negative reviews about Air China complaining about the lack of English spoken.

To this date (December 23rd), Aeromexico has neither refunded the ticket price nor honored their offer for an open ticket. All I get when I call the airline are lies and more lies -- first, they said that the money had already been refunded, and then that I would get a voucher for 115% of the ticket price, but none of that is true. The airline's latest communication was to send us a notice informing us that our claim was subject to their bankruptcy proceeding in New York. Yet another lie - that proceeding does not affect any claim against the airline that was created after June 30, 2020. They'll probably also claim that the flight cancellation was caused by Covid, although they sold the ticket and cancelled the flight in August, well after they knew all about the pandemic's effect on air travel.

,Aegean Airlines,Economy Class,January 2020,18th January 2020,0,4,1,UnitedKingdom,4,no,"Frankfurt to Athens. It might be my impression but it feels like the legroom has been reduced, seats are awful and  uncomfortable. The customer service is  average along with the cleanliness of the aircraft. As long as the flight is fully booked the land crew requests from clients to board with just the hand luggage and deliver the carry-on luggage to the hold (free of charge as they claim). This review was written with the value-for-money in mind as the primary factor. Hence there is no reason at all booking the tickets with Aegean if you are about to pay more and receive the same legroom and seat-comfort to any other low-cost flying company Since Aegean allows its passengers to fly in Economy/Go-Light with the standard carry-on luggage and handbag allowance (as stated on their ticket), they should adhere to that. The reason passengers do that is because it allows them to quickly grab their bags and catch the next flight without having to wait on the belt to retrieve luggage. I agree with the company's policy to weigh/measure the carry-on luggage prior to boarding in order to filter any passengers carrying excessive carry-ons. However as long as the passenger is compliant  they shouldn't force him/her deliver their carry-on to the hold. I am a Silver member over the past 3 years and during this flight I requested for my ticket to be upgraded. However the representative assured me that I wasn't able since the flight was in cooperation with Lufthansa. When I asked to upgrade only the ticket from Frankfurt to Athens (operated by Aegean) they declined providing me the same reason.

He then advised me to wait until 24 hours before my flight to do this as there was a chance I could get my money back in the event that the flight was cancelled.

When booking our flights we paid a lot more money to have specific seating arrangements and food. We were booked to fly from Copenhagen to Los Angeles via London. We arrived at the airport 7:30 a.m. and stood in line until the check in agent opened at 9:00 a.m. I was the only one there standing in line as I wanted to beat the crowd. We checked in and went to security and they said our flight had been cancelled. Went back to agent and she said ""No"" flight had not been cancelled and the security were mistaken. We went back to security with some airline person with us and went through. We tried to find out which gate our flight was at and it was not listed. We finally found an Air Berlin agent at another gate. They said they could not help me as they could ""only see their own flight on their computer screen"". I persisted and finally they checked and said to go to gate 23 which we had been at. No one was there and it was 20 minutes until boarding. We left and started searching for some other help. After at least 2 attempts with various agents (not Air Berlin as they are not at that airport) our flight had been cancelled prior to our arriving at the airport. Air Berlin did not contact us about that. Air Berlin had transferred our reservations to British Airways but no one had told us. We went to British Airways (BA). We were fortunate to ask for help from an airport employee who walked us to various agent windows talking to them in English and Dutch and finally got us some answers. All of this is over a multi hour period of time. We found out from BA that when Air Berlin had made the reservations they had failed to make arrangements for the seating requirements we had paid for (aisle seat, extra leg room as one of us has medical conditions that require this). British Airways said they could not make any changes to our tickets from London to the USA until we landed in London. That is a whole other story as that was difficult and stressful even though BA was working with us; it was just too late to make many changes on an already ""booked flight"". BA were finally able to make the needed changes but it took much time and was a devastating experience due to the failures of Air Berlin. In each airport we tried to speak to Air Berlin, London Heathrow and LAX, there were no Air Berlin employees at that time. Our luggage is lost and Air Berlin did not provide any ""claim checks"" to us so we are sitting here now, not knowing where our luggage is (Air Berlin told us that it was already on the BA flight which was not true) or if we will ever see it again as we have no claim check tickets.

Their website is very difficult to use, their cabin staff only perfunctory, and the onboard experience lacking. The aircraft were reasonable with seatback screens but the movie choice was very limited and the system slow and hard to navigate, especially with the oddly placed armrest controls. My 777 screen stopped working entirely after 7 hours. The flight attendants did not appear to be happy, warm or welcoming. Their English was passable but their pronunciation poor so cabin announcements are difficult to understand. Beer is available on the drinks round but wine is only available with meals and they like to give you 1/3 of a cup. Asking for a second glass was not received well. The meals were tiny. Taste was good but they sometimes served the same dishes twice per flight. I booked a transit hotel in Beijing both ways, but the process was cumbersome even after I spoke to their call centre. Both ways it took 3 hours to get the transit visa and go through immigration and customs, so be prepared. The Air China service desk is through customs at the door to the terminal. The hotels were quite good but there was nothing nearby either of them.

So I promised myself I will write a review about it. Best value for money: what caused me to book was the offer of flying a flat bed C-class seat from JFK to Shanghai for $2,200 (return tkt), only with a quick stopover of 90 minutes in PEK. Pre-flight concerns: - I kept receiving automated emails from the airline that my itinerary has changed and that I should contact them and I can change/get a refund for my tkt. The small change that happened once was a 5 minute change in departure time which increased my layover in PEK (good thing, since you need those 90 minute to transfer) - customer service: it's impossible to reach them by phone, the line is not manned. So I emailed them. They responded within 24hrs (or so) and said that my flight's transfer time in PEK is too short and my tkt needs to be changed. But when I went online I saw that my same exact flight itinerary was still being sold on various websites, incl. airchina.us. - The inconsistent response from their customer service really got me worried about the reliability of this airline, so I did some more research online on helpful reviews. I mostly read terrible reviews on how delayed the flights were, people missing their connections and being treated very poorly. That's when I got really worried about having booked this ticket, but figured I will take the risk. Also TPG wrote a fairly good review on them, so that felt comforting. Flight: - Outbound: upper deck of Boeing 747, half empty cabin. Seat was perfectly comfortable (flat bed). Service was smooth, food was good/fine - meat a bit chewy. Staff are friendly and helpful, though be aware they only speak limited english. - Inbound: Boeing 777-300 - full cabin. Seat perfectly comfortable (flat bed). Service was great, they accommodated my specific food requests despite not having ordered in advance. Overall a great flying experience. - All flights were pretty much on time - In-flight entertainment is ok, limited movies selection / limited music selection - no WIFI. Transfers in PEK: - 90 minutes is definitely needed if transferring. You need to take a quick 'airtrain' trip from domestic to intl., even if you don't change Terminals. The connecting flight to and from SHA was a tarmac parked aircraft with bus transfers, so that added time as well.

We went very early the next day, try to check in our daughters again and the same notice came up. So we went to find out what the issue was and a guy at customer service very rude and unpleasant, notify us like nothing that the two tickets for our daughters were sold out to their own staff. I could NOT understand what was happening at the same time and why would they do that to tickets that were already paid 4 months ahead of time. Anyways after arguing and actually crying we had to leave our two daughters behind waiting there to get accommodations for the next day on the evening. With the loss of two days of their flights and my agony as a mother we left them behind. Because they could not accommodate all of us on the same flights now because everything was sold out. We wrote to Air Canada a complaint and the excuse was because of the weather their flight was delay. Not knowing that we already knew that the tickets were re-sold to accommodate their own employees.

I booked this last minute due to Air Berlin going bankrupt and cancelling our flights. Had some hesitation, but overall I had a good experience. Premium economy rate was reasonable, however seat choice was problematic. The recline was adequate, but could have used higher feet elevation. Staff were attentive and friendly. I packed enough essential items on my carry ons in case the actual luggage got lost, since so many complaints of losing luggage, ours arrived on our destinations just fine. They are Very strict on weight of luggage, they will weigh the carry ons 10 kg max each and the regular luggage 23 kg max, I almost had a problem in Venice. My husband and I were allowed 2 check in each total of 4, we were checking in only 3 so we had ample extra but I packed the bags 24 kg, 25 kg, 15 kg. They insisted to move the luggage around even though we could have more. So make sure to pack under each suitcase. The food in flight was delicious, they had sea bass, halibut, beef brisket,etc. Even for 3 or 4 hr flight they served a full meal. However, they serve the drinks first, so don't finish the drinks or ask for 2,if you like drinking during your meals. The movie selection was adequate, the headphones are 2 prong, they only distribute once the plane is in flight so bring your own if you have one. There is a USB charger. People bring pets in the plane, small dogs,etc. The lady next to me wanted to put her dog by my foot, and I refused, they should be made to buy business class for more space, plus she put her dirty, bare foot on the food tray to elevate, which was gross, and she ate there! At the airport they sometimes bus you to the smaller planes, and it is cold! Bring warm clothing, thick jacket, scarf, hat.

I am trying to avoid Air Berlin as best as I can - due to their bad service and punctuality record and inferior cabin product compared to Eurowings, Lufthansa, Swiss and even Easyjet. But for an afternoon flight from the Dusseldorf region to Milano, AB8746 at 15.35 is the only option. Having taken this flight twice in less than 2 months, it really leaves me angry to again experience significant delay of almost 1 hour for this flight on 1 September - for my previous flight on 7 July it was 40 mins. While the airline sent a message by email (that I missed), Dusseldorf airport provided no information about the delay. Also, the gate staff only announces the delay 15 mins prior to departure? Surely, the airport should have known for at least 2 hours. Studying the departure boards, I see that Air Berlin had to cancel two flights (Munich and Stockholm). So maybe I should count myself ""lucky"" to only be delayed.

The problem came on landing. We had flown from Dubai and our luggage transferred to the Air Berlin flight 6196. When we got off in Berlin it was not marked where to go so we followed others who were walking out. Just at the exit doors I noticed we were exiting and asked the guard where to go for luggage. He only said ""go to Terminal C lost baggage"". Once you are just 1 inch out the sliding door you can not go back to get your baggage. Ok follow policy blindly with no common sense, thats what EU is all about I guess. Once at the lost baggage it was chaos as about 20 airlines had turned over their lost baggage to a 3rd party company called WISAG. It took one hr in line to reach a man who only said ""go file a claim on line"" thats it. ""Go use the iPad over there"". The lady ahead of us was German and was totally outraged and the SA man being us in line had also done the very same thing too. The next day we came back and again after 1 hr in line they looked at the screen and said ""Nope its not listed here"" and ""we still have 18 carts not yet unloaded back there from last week"". We then went up to the Air Berlin counter in the terminal and they just looked at us with a blank who cares look and said ""go back to lost luggage"" thats all, no help at all. They did not care in the least.  We went back again at 11 pm and finally got one of the men (there were ever only 2 there) who took some compassion on us when I said 'my wife cancer drugs were in her bag and our tour group left tomorrow'. He said ""maybe I saw them yesterday"" and he actually went back and found them. We had been in a state of despair what to do, totaly zero information or help by anyone at Air Berlin.

Attitude of the ground staff was that they do not actually care - in their words ""we can do nothing with it"". It is OK when the system screws it up but then I expect staff to work towards the customer service, not to let a 2 years old sit alone.

The flight arrived late into Beijing and I missed the connecting flight to Los Angeles. They made everyone wait in an area for forty minutes, then put everyone in a bus that got lost twice and took ninety minutes to get to a hotel. No food was provided, my bathroom had no shower door and had a clogged sink. I was the only Caucasian amongst all Chinese. Not a word of English was spoken. When flying from Los Angeles to Shanghai five days earlier the same thing occurred. My flight from Shanghai to Beijing was cancelled due to weather and I was forced to spend the night in Beijing. Rather than accept their accommodation I took the money they offered, forty six dollars and found a four star hotel that cost $250. Air Canada had its passengers stay at the same, pricey but reasonable, hotel. The following day, after spending three hours on the tarmac, without any communication from the pilots, the flight finally departed for Shanghai. Returning from Shanghai I was wiser but no less lucky. My flight from Shanghai to Beijing showed that it would be delayed and I knew I would miss my connecting flight to Los Angeles. An hour prior to the flight leaving I informed the airline staff that I would miss my connecting flight and requested they instead arrange another one. I even showed them flight options on my phone. The answer was no answer. I had to take the flight or be left on my own in Shanghai, not knowing what would happen. I took the flight to Beijing and was then taken to the hotel. I kept asking myself, why can’t Air China run some very simple regression analysis to determine the chances of customers making flights given variables like seasonal weather patterns and historic flight delays. The only answer I could come up with was they either do not think it is important or do not know how to do it. Why do airports in China suffer some of the longest delays in the world? As mentioned in the Economist, “The first reason is that its airports err on the side of extreme safety.” This is consistent with state run ideology. Play it safe. No mistakes, and you won’t get in trouble.

Inflight entertainment is pre-historic small flat screens hanging from the roof every few metres showing just one film and a couple of cartoons. Drink service several choices including alcohol. Meal service with two options fish or chicken. Nice cheesecake for dessert. Finally after the trays had been collected crew served vanilla ice cream. Although the flight took almost 6 hours with an arrival time of 6 am no breakfast was served. Coffee or tea would have been appreciated especially given the 2 hour immigration queue at Astana upon landing. Overall a more than acceptable experience.

Unfortunately due to the COVID outbreak we were starting to reconsider the trip and called customer service to inquire about our options. We contacted Aeroméxico in March to request a refund (over $3,000CAD). We were directed not to be haste and to hold on for a while longer, until we were closer to the departure date. On May 21st we called again Aeroméxico, requesting a refund for the 4 round flight tickets and we were informed, that unfortunately that would not be possible. The gentleman was very courteous, acknowledged our feelings and explained their policies regarding a refund. He then proceeded to inform us that Aeroméxico would, however, allow us to reissue the tickets for a later date however, the flights would have to be rescheduled for a date no later than April 30th, 2020. At that point I e-mailed several letters to Aeroméxico Customer Service department and requested them to please extend the vouchers deadline (provided them with a time frame that would work for us) and explained valid reasons why we would not be able to travel within the time frame given. We also stated the reasons why we would not be able to travel this July. In my letter I also mentioned that I have been a frequent costumer and I have always enjoyed traveling with their airline and would like to continue to be a loyal customer. (We love Mexico and we love to travel there.) At the end, they stated that they appreciated our patience in resolving the matter and have extended our voucher's validity to our satisfaction. Would we have like a refund? Yes, of course! However, we tend to forget that everyone has been affected by the COVID pandemic, even big corporations have lost and are continuing to lose billions of dollars due to this unprecedented situation. All of us need to be united, understanding and try to find a compromise in which both parties will be pleased with the outcome.

The first flight out was on 12th  march and the upgrade bid was accepted and paid for. Unfortunately within a few days of travel the holiday was cancelled and we were advised to return home. Aer Lingus offered free change of flight but price difference would apply. The change function on the website and app were not working. I received a message telling me to contact direct by phone. I was surprised by this in such an age of automation, and a little disappointed. But I was given no other option by Aer Lingus. I called as advised and was on hold for a full 2 hours, I then spoke to an agent who advised my change of flights would be €435 as this represented the fare difference. I accepted and was asked to wait so he could set up payment, then he hung up without taking payment. I was not called or contacted by this agent despite him confirming my phone and email details. So I called again, and again on hold, this went on for 90 minutes when again, having not spoken to an agent, the line was hung up. I called again and after 1 hour the same occurred. That now made it close to 5 hours and no change of flights possible, the frustration at this lack of basic functionality in such a company I found staggering. With the global situation going from bad to worse and the fear of being trapped in the states with no medical insurance and all the other problems a lock down or illness would bring, we had no choice but to book completely different flights to get us home. Again we went with Aer Lingus and this cost us €1577.76. Although I was glad I could get us home, and in the knowledge that I did not have to use Aer Lingus again, despite being so frustrated at the lack of service, I did. But would have been a lot happier if the same ease to book new flights could have been matched by the process for changing existing flights. I received a mail 18th of March to say that I could cancel my flights for the 23rd and would receive a credit in the way of a flight credit plus 10%, again I would have preferred a refund but, was happy to cancel the flight and take the credit to be used later. Then I received a mail to say that my upgrade for my cancelled flight home had been approved and a further €980 had been debited to my card. I now make that a total of €2,5557.76 that I have paid Aer Lingus for flights I should have been able to change for €435. A staggering €2,122.76 cost difference because Aer lingus could not provide basic functionality to change a flight during an emergency. since then I have sent a number of emails looking for clarification and have been replied to by different people each time. the latest tells me that no vouchers apply for flights before the 21st of March. my flight was on the 23rd and I have provided all the documentation they have asked for on this.

My last flights, AB 8746 in July from Düsseldorf to Milan and AB 8731 in 13 June from Milan to Berlin were delayed. Communication with AB is difficult, waiting times at the hotline can be over 15 mins - only to speak to badly trained staff. On Sunday 12 June (I had an email informing me of a cancellation of my direct LIN - TXL flight for 13 June), I had to call the hotline three times to find alternative ways of getting to Berlin (in this case via Vienna). I ended up being double booked - hence the many calls. As a OneWorld Sapphire member (through BA), I am also frustrated that AB is gotten worse in seat selection. While not so long ago, a Sapphire member would get priority seats, this is not the case anymore and seats can only be booked from row 15. So, as it happens, on flight AB 8476 on 7 July, rows 3-14 were almost completely empty. Seating is also really bad and cramped - not more difference to Ryanair. On 7 July, the plane was not cleaned properly, maybe to make up for the delay of 40 mins? Another ""policy!"" to alienate frequent and business travellers is the restrictive hand luggage check before security at some German airports. I would understand if AB was a low-cost airline trying to make some more money by passengers checking in luggage. However, AB is still charging tariffs closer to Lufthansa than Easyjet or Ryanair, so it should at least try and show more flexibility for its passengers, particularly business travellers.

The airline did not load my luggage on to the connecting flight in Moscow not once, but twice - on both my outward and return journeys. I flew to Tokyo from Heathrow with a stopover in Moscow. Unfortunately, the first leg of the flight was delayed by an hour or so (with no reason given). As a result, I was rushed through the airport in Moscow and was frantically ushered on to my connection. When I arrived in Tokyo Narita I was informed that my case was still in Moscow. It was two days before I received it at the address I was staying at. I did consider the idea that this could happen again on my return journey three weeks later, but surely not? Oh yes it could. This time there were no delays, yet when I returned to London I was told that my bag was still in Moscow and could take a day or two to be delivered to me. I was given a number to call that looked suspiciously like a mobile number and told that they could not guarantee when I got my bag back. Early the next morning, I tried to call to find out where my bag was. The number given went straight to voicemail. I tried to call it several times, but still nothing. I then tried to call the baggage customer helplines. All three numbers were busy and I didn't succeed in getting through to anyone over a five hour period. Calling the baggage handler responsible for Aeroflot at Heathrow was also useless, and they passed me another mobile number that also didn't answer.

A332 / DH8D,Air Berlin,Economy Class,May 2016,14th July 2016,3,4,3,UnitedStates,7,yes,"New York JFK to Krakow via Berlin with Air Berlin. Because of the short layover time, and the affordability of the tickets, it proved to be our best option as it was only slightly longer than a direct flight. We took the overnight flight from JFK to TXL on an A332, flying in economy. We made sure to get to the Airport very early, but check in was very quick and smooth, so we had ample time to do everything we needed to do. Our flight out was delayed for about 50 minutes, which is typical of almost any flight out of JFK, but because of our short layover in Berlin (just under 2 hours, plus having to go through customs) this did worry us. We were only able to get center aisle seats. The seats themselves, while comfortable to sit in, did not offer much leg room for someone like me who is 6'3"" so the long haul flight was a bit uncomfortable in the later hours. The entertainment screens on our seats seemed to work, but not very well, but we tried to sleep much of the flight, so we did not fidget with it too much. The flight included diner after take off, and a light breakfast before landing. Meal was better than one would expect for economy class airline food. Staff was very attentive and friendly. We arrived in Berlin about an hour behind schedule, and because of this, the airline made a point to find anyone who had a short connection and move the up in the customs line, so they could catch their next flight. We were a bit worried, especially since we had to connect in a different terminal (and this meant going back through security at TXL). Luckily, everything moved quite quickly (German efficiency) and we made it to our connection gate with 25 minutes to spare before boarding. The second leg, was a short flight from TXL to Krakow. This was on a smaller turbo prop plane, a DC-H8. While the plane felt a bit older on the inside than the A330 we had just flown on, the leg room was much, much better. We had seats on the wing, just behind the props, but we didn't find this to be any louder than a normal flight. The flight itself was nice, and as before, the flight staff was friendly. Overall, we were very satisfied with our flight and our experience. Our only issue was on our return flight. A few days before we were scheduled to leave, we had a death in the family. This would require us to stay a few days later. Our ticket package did not allow for rebooking, but I was hoping they could work with us with options on what we could try to do. Unfortunately, they offered none, and the person I talked to did not seem interested in going further than telling me, 'There is nothing we can do for you.' Given the circumstances, I was hoping we could have figured out something, but instead, we had to book a flight through another airline (which ended up being cheaper than what it would have cost to book the return through Air Berlin).

Air China may be good value for money but be prepared for all the troubles and headaches that you will face with this airline from their uncomfortable seats, not working monitors, stained and smelly seat covers, delayed departure (one day) to loss of baggage. With Air China you are like a guinea pig you don't know where the flight is taking you, you cannot communicate with anyone in China if you don't speak Chinese.

Failed to accommodate me or compensate for anything - just gave 350 CNY = $50 AUD to spend 13 hours in Beijing airport. Resting charge minimum starts 180 CNY per hour and 165 CNY to take a shower. My luggage had to stay in Beijing as I couldn't pass through customs, the airline failed to get me my luggage and asked me to claim it lost when I get home while my luggage was one floor away. Spent 13 hours on a bench in Beijing then they arranged for me to take a flight from Hong Kong to Melbourne as there were no flights for the next 3 days from Beijing itself (according to airline) however there were many flights. So all the way to Hong Kong the airport closed while we were in the air - I understand the situation but Air China lands in a city (Shenzhen) where they don't have any staff, any counter, any office or anything related to Air China. So I was again stuck in Shenzhen immigration. Immigration was forcing me to contact the airline, on many attempts by using the officer's phone I failed to get through, the immigration gave up and forced me to buy the earliest flight possible from Shenzhen to get out of the airport. For 12 hours stuck in 3x3 meter spot, no one from Ari China showed up to help or look for the passenger who is their responsibility to arrange accommodation for and arrange the flights for. After 12 hours Shenzhen immigration officers forces me to buy a ticket and claim it back from Air China as we did not hear anything from them. Coming back home after and seeking reimbursement, took 45 days Air China offered TCV Transportation Credit Voucher to spend only with Air China within 12 months. Like are you kidding me, this travel I had was after 3 years and I know for the next 2 years I am not traveling anywhere so their TCV meant nothing but gas and air, after telling them I will not be traveling for the next 12 months they suggest I give the TCV to a friend or family. Like seriously is this some sort of a joke. I was forced to buy another ticket twice more expensive than the entire return trip while I had already paid for one and Air China failed to provide any assistance and service for, they ask me to pass the voucher to family and friend. I earned that money, it is a whole month worth of rent to pay here in Australia and they ask me to pass it to a family or friend. None of my friends or family would ever travel with an irresponsible airline after what I had been through took me 4 days to get home (Melbourne). I do not recommend anyone to fly with Air China.

I flew out from Toronto (YYZ) to Fort Lauderdale (FLL) on June 22, 2022, Flight 1628. To begin with, as sprawling as Pearson Airport is the signage is lacking and honestly not clear at all, so it was extremely confusing to figure out exactly where we needed to go just to check in for our specific flight. Air Canada's ground customer service was painfully slow and inefficient - I get there are staffing shortages with the pandemic aftermath, but this was a little excessive. Our flight boarded a few minutes behind schedule which wasn't the end of the world, but we were scheduled to take off at 4.45pm and did not take off until almost 7.00pm! All of us literally sat on the tarmac going nowhere for over 2 hours! The cabin crew was essentially clueless and the pilot kept giving one excuse after another for the delay which didn't even make sense. Every passenger was pretty agitated about the situation, to say the least...we finally took off way behind schedule and did not make it into Fort Lauderdale until almost 10.00pm (original landing time was 7.45pm). The flight itself was OK. At least on AC Rouge, I found the legroom to be mediocre, and the seating marginally comfortable. Flight attendants were generally polite, but not necessarily friendly. Overall, this is my second experience flying Air Canada. My first time was in 2015 going to/from Montreal and I also dealt with poor customer service then, so I should have learned my lesson, but I hope this cautions other potential fliers to avoid Air Canada if at all possible - especially if your travel plans are not flexible or if you need to catch a connecting flight!",Toronto to Fort Lauderdale,2,3,air-canada-rouge,avoid Air Canada if at all possible,Family Leisure,Trip Verified,1,3,de7e8633-9aca-4d89-99a7-14ab06b24e74

Being born in Russia, I have been always proud of Russian hospitality and the high quality of service. Unfortunately, each Aeroflot flight undermines my pride. I have been dissapointed, when my flight Moscow to Yerevan was cancelled without any prior announcement. I was waiting in Sheremetyevo to check-in my luggage (only two counters were opened for international flight passengers) just to find out that my flight is cancelled. However, one can see ""on time"" mark on the timetable. My husband was at that time flying to Moscow from Berlin to catch the same flight. Dut to the weather conditions, I expected the cancellation to happen, but what happened next, demonstrates the complete lack of Aeroflot`s ability to organize the passenger flow in such situations. My husband eventually got stuck in the transit zone with the flight information ""on time"", no Aeroflot personnel and people, who were sleeping on the mattresses! He found an Aeroflot representative only after an hour of running through different terminals of Sheremetyevo airport. At the same time I was literally fighting to get the same-day-flight to Yerevan (2 ladies at the counter for over 200 passengers), while the Aeroflot representative was extremely impolite and borderline offensive. Eventually, I got a flight 3 hours later (which got delayed for 3 more hours), and my husband managed to get a flight 3 hours (plus 1 hour delay) after my delayed flight. Waiting time at Sheremetyevo was more than 10 hours. We could not even fly together. They still had seats but they pointed out that it ""is too difficult for them"". No food or hotel were provided, not even a bottle of water. Anyway, the whole time all I wanted to hear was: ""We are sorry for your inconvenience. Your possible options would be"".

We were going to simply cancel the flight, but when I contacted Air Berlin they said that they would at least reimburse the cost of staying at an airport hotel the night before, so we agreed. But then, after the flight, they refused to make the reimbursement. Instead they offered me a voucher, which I just find insulting - why on earth would I want to book with them again? I fly a lot with budget airlines, and of course have experienced plenty of delays and frustrations over the years, but have never before felt that an airline has deliberately chosen to treat me badly.

I was notified by my travel agent initially via email and apparently, was extremely shocked. I then phoned the agent but to no avail and given that there was no after-hour support in my region, I called their reservations hotline in Russia, only to find that some of their staff did not even speak comprehensible English. To complicate things, they denied the reservations code they themselves supplied, claiming that there was no numbers but only letters, when it clearly contained 2 numbers! After a rather unproductive 5-minute conversation where the staff kept prompting me to repeat and verify the reference code, they asked me for the ticket number. Guess what? They then forwarded me to another service agent, kind of implying it was a special case and they couldn't handle it. When I was finally connected, I was asked to supply the reference code again and they once again said their reference codes do not contain numbers. Of course, that member of staff also ended up asking me to quote the ticket number and sounded hugely impatient when I said ""hold on let me retrieve it"" with a long and deep breath. Mind you, it took me less than 15 seconds to retrieve it. When I finally started quoting the number, that staff member did not respond until I repeated a few times the first 6 digits and the deafening silence caused me to think the call was interrupted. Yet, after a few ""hellos"" he finally went ""CONTINUE!"" and that was one of the most impolite commands I'd ever encountered in phone conversations with airline personnel! To make things worse, he then said he needed to check my booking details further and put me on hold without even saying anything like ""please hold the line"".

Aeromexico changed the return trip departure time that did not allow sufficient time to go from the national terminal #2 to the international terminal #1 which also requires security clearance again. Distance between #2 to #1 is great and Terminal #1 is very large with much walking required. Long talks with agents and supervisors with inflexible responses. On two days the supervisors suggested I call back to speak with them on the following day to see if they would allow us to take an earlier flight to make our connections. Both times I called back at the suggested time and both of the names they had given me were unknown to anyone at the Houston call center. If they make a two hour or greater change their inflexible policy is only then accommodation is possible! They know exactly what they are doing to generate extra revenue. We were forced to buy an earlier flight at higher cost and they got to re-sell our now later flight a second time above my earlier booked price. We were held hostage in Mexico until we paid up or being trapped in Mexico City if we missed our flight home due to their change in departure time. They well knew this would impact many people on a large flight north.

The first problem was check in, we could not check in ahead of time because of a lack of access to the internet but we had to check our bags anyway. We were 2nd in line to check in, 20 minutes to get to the desk to check in. The employees were non-communicative about the delay in the process. Boarding was chaos. There was an additional delay in Berlin, not a problem, we figured it would give them time to load our luggage from the previous flight. Not one bag was unloaded from the plane in Frankfurt. An entire plane full of luggage was lost? They let us wait at the carousel at 1am for over 30 minutes before it was announced that all passengers must fill out a lost luggage form. It was chaos there too, people pushing and shoving to get a paper at the desk, they didn't have enough for everyone. 2 days after landing my husband finally reached someone who told him none of the luggage was loaded on the plane. I have 2 problems with this: 1) If they knew they didn't load any luggage on the plane, why didn't they give the passengers the lost luggage paper on the plane to fill out during the flight? That would have spared us another hour at the airport. 2) It seems that it was more likely that the airport workers decided not to off load the plane. We finally get our luggage 2.5 days later.

The notation on the display boards indicated that it was still boarding but it had departed by the time I got to the gate.

My observation on all Aeroflot flights, drinks are served first then the meal followed after half an hour and another round of drinks after another half an hour. It was a bit inconvenient eating without something to drink. The food trays are collected by the flight attendants after 30 minutes or so that passngers voluntered to bring them to the galley. .Definitely no alcholo on-board.

In compare with, for example, Finnair business class with fewer seats in a row, the Aeroflot B777 seats offer little less privacy, because they are closer to the aisle, but the width of the seat itself is good. Considering the lower price of the Aeroflot business class ticket, it's a very good deal. Nice detail: a pillowcase sealed in a plastic bag was included in the blanket/pillow set.

Last year they were bad, now they are worst. Much worse. The tagging of the luggage was a never ending process with maximum bothering system, consisting in 3 different people from the Aegean trying to use scanners which were not working and redirecting us from one to the other. The process lasted long to infinite because we were seven persons in the group. Moreover, after that, when boarding the bus which lead to the plane, the personnel insisted in a more than aggressive voice and body language in us going into a very crowded bus in which there wasnt any room left for us. More than that, we explained that we could not separate the members of our group because we were 7 and not everyone was speaking english. They separated us nevertheless between two different buses and one of the passengers had a panic attack.

We dealt with United for four days trying to get our luggage from Newark to Athens. Eventually they told us to Taxi back to the airport and promised our luggage was there, a very kind supervisor came out and talked to us to explain the luggage was not, in fact, there. (We did not even ask for a supervisor.) He was very understanding and patient and asked us to trust him. At this point our time in Athens was over and we left the airport to board our cruise ship, thinking there was no way we'd ever get our luggage in the middle of the ocean. The next night there it was in our cabin when we opened the door! We couldn't believe it. The supervisor had gotten our luggage from Newark to Athens, then onto Santorini Island, where our Princess Cruise ship then transported it from the island and onto the ship and then to our room - all within a day. In all we went five days without luggage, but once Aegean was involved we had it within about a day, in a much more difficult route than it would have been for United to simply put it on the plane to Athens. Everyone was so compassionate and kind. But it didn't end there. Upon arriving home, I began the impossible task of dealing with United to receive compensation - they had told us to keep all receipts for the five days without luggage and we had. We spent hours on hold, hours on the phone, getting nowhere. Finally, based on the File Reference number (that I'd given them over and over and over) someone finally clued in and explained the International agreement that wherever you end up is who is responsible for the luggage. Wait, so we get to deal with Aegean again? Wonderful! I called and a kind man explained exactly what to do and gave me an email. In less than a day I got a response telling me exactly what to do to make a very easy process go smoothly. I've spent three weeks with United and got nowhere, while being treated rudely. In the last few days everything has been submitted to Aegean in a easy process with a kind person on the other end helping.

I had to take an emergency flight back to the states because my father passed away suddenly. I searched on skyscanner and Aer Lingus was the cheapest so I booked it. I am a disabled passenger so requested wheelchair service, as I cant walk or stand for very long. I did not however receive a wheelchair at any point of the journey. And I wasn't pointed in the right direction to get one.  I flew out of London city which is a small airport so I was able to make it through security and to the gate. When I got to Dublin I waited for everyone to leave from the plane before I did, as it's easier and less of a pain standing and waiting behind people. There was quite a long walk to get down the plane steps and into the baggage area to then find my way to my connecting flight. I noticed on the baggage belt there was a suitcase similar to mine, it was in fact my suitcase! They were supposed to have transferred it onto my next flight to Philadelphia. Luckily I had seen this because who knows if it would have made it there. Anyway after trying to find someone to take my luggage I noticed a desk and I explained the situation and said they'd personally make sure it made it onto my next flight Between my connecting flight I had to go through security again, which annoyed me. At security I hadn't put the tray on the belt straight so staff called me back to do it. It was very condescending, when she could have easily done it herself. Once on the plane, it was very spacious as I was lucky enough to have both seats next to me empty, which made the trip very pleasant. My flight home was easier than the trip I had there. I would like to warn people not to purchase the wifi. I have never had an issue purchasing wifi on a flight before but to spend £6/€6 on what I thought would last longer than a couple minutes, I think is disgusting (They confirmed it lasted 4.4mins) I have disputed this and they refuse to refund or do anything about my complaint. Also they ran out of the choice of food on the plane, con of sitting towards the back end of the plane I suppose, but I don't think this should happen.

Afterwards, I checked reviews online and began getting worried as the common theme seemed to be that staff was horrible, planes were cramped, and they lose luggage often. With those images in my head I went to the airport in Amsterdam hoping for the best but expecting the worst. The staff at the counter was pleasant and although there are no boarding groups everyone got on the plane free from incident. The plane wasn't any more cramped than other budget airlines. After US preclearance in Dublin, I boarded a larger plane from there to San Francisco. The plane was about half full which gave us our pick of open seats and the flight attendants were surprisingly pleasant. In fact, one gave me an extra meal saying I ""looked like a growing lad"".

At the counter in Frankfurt I and about 20 other passengers were told by Aer Lingus staff that they would not check us in because Aer Lingus flights that day from Dublin into the US were cancelled. They did not give an explanation as to why although later I was told that it was 'operational problems'. We were sent to a separate desk with generic airport booking employees unrelated to Aer Lingus for rebooking. These airport people had to call the regular Aer Lingus hotlines in order to be able to rebook anyone, but these hotlines were busy for more than an hour, and the Aer Lingus people in those call center were only allowed to process 3 rebookings in a single call, drawing this whole process out unnecessarily. During this time the flight to Dublin had departed and the original Aer Lingus front desk people had disappeared. It took 3 hours until my rebooking was looked into, at which time most alternative transatlantic flight options for that day were gone. So were all the options with any of their partner airlines with which they allow free rebookings (of which there are few in the first place). So I was told to take a hotel and wait for a flight the next day.  I instead had to book a flight for the same day via British Airways via London on my own and had to pay over 2000EUR for that. Most of that money I now have as a loss, but at least according to EU regulation Aer Lingus owes me a compensation of 600EUR which would at least pay for a part of it. In phone calls and mail communication they have now started to claim that the flight had not been cancelled it had only been delayed and they don't owe me compensation. I checked the flight history on Flightaware and saw that EI0139 on 1/7 did indeed fly. The reason for this mess up I can't fathom. In any way, since they barred me from the flight, they owe me 600EUR regardless if the flight in the end would have been possible or not. While I'll eventually get the 600EUR, the time and money wasted so far both with the situation during the trip and dealing with them in the aftermath is enormous. And greatest is the disappointment with Aer Lingus. I have flow with them a couple of times and from those experiences had thought them to be a half way solid airline.

Boarding at Tegel is a little chaotic only because of no priority line (given the small airport/individual security at the gates). For some reason German efficiency never applies at security at any German airport, anywhere, but that's another matter. Boarding was easy and smooth and quickly given champagne. Didn't get to see the AB lounge at Tegel. For return used the American lounge at JFK-nothing special, but this is American/OneWorld in general. No arrivals facilities/showers though at Berlin. On both legs the cabin crew were outstanding: efficient service, but also fun/friendly people who clearly enjoyed their jobs, which is not what you typically get flying anymore. My only advice would be to try to be sure to get a window seat or the middle section if you have no one next to you; the aisle seats in their configuration (similar to Delta's) feel a bit exposed.

I ended up preferring to stay in the airport. But my flight back from Beijing to Frankfurt was a complete nightmare. The crew were serving sea food. I called the air attendants and told them that I have a really strong allergy and the smell was already causing an allergic reaction. I faced a completely unprepared and careless crew. They didn't let me to leave my sit and just gave me tissues! I told them several times that I just needed to find a place away from the smell.

,Air China,Premium Economy,April 2019,26th June 2019,1,1,1,UnitedStates,1,no,"New York to Bangkok via Beijing. I've been traveling for years and this is the 1st and last time I will ever use them. I just got married and my husband and I planned a 2 month honeymoon to Asia. We purchased a round trip from JFK with a layover in Beijing before arriving in Bangkok. The return flight was from Hong Kong with layover in Beijing before landing in Newark, NJ. Our flight in April to Bangkok experienced multiple delays which caused us to miss our layover in Beijing by 5 minutes. We actually had a 75 mins layover in Beijing, but due to the delays, we and almost everyone else on our plane missed our transfers. They couldn't tell their other planes to wait 5-10 mins for everyone to make their flights?? Instead, we saw most of the fliers crowded around the Air China counter. Everyone had to get a temporary visa and herd onto their buses to spend a night in a disgusting, filthy motel because the next flights out were the following day. My husband and I missed our 1st night in Bangkok and of course weren't reimbursed in any way. Throughout the ordeal, we saw all of the passengers at the Air China counters and they, like us, were appalled and furious with their lack of customer service. They just don't care. Now for our flight returning back to NY from Hong Kong on 6/17. We received an email saying that Air China changed our flights so we called Chase Travel. We saw that they changed the planes, times and moved us from Premium Economy to Economy. Why? We paid the extra amount for Economy. Once on the phone with Chase, we selected another flight for 7:30AM that was Premium Economy. We even waited on the phone until we received the email confirmation from Chase for our new flights. So on 6/17 we get to HK airport to check in and they only have my husband's name and not mine. Air China said I was on a 11PM flight and that it was Chase's fault. That was not the case. My husband and I spent hours on the phone with Chase and Air China, and Air China were the ones to cancel my ticket (we have no idea why). Instead of just putting me on the 7:30AM flight, they kept my husband on hold for 50 minutes, then finally told him that they could change his flight for $4000 to be with me for the 11PM. How does that make sense? Why are we being punished for Air China's mistake? They changed our flights then split us up but putting us on different flights that land in different airports. Then they have the audacity to tell him to pay $4000 for him to be on the 11PM when they could've just put me on the 7:30AM which was confirmed. They could have even put us on the next Air China flight after that. My husband ended up purchasing completely new flights with EVA which was $2800 compared to the $2500 round trip with Air China! It's now 7/25 and I've been on the phone with Chase for almost 4.5 hours because the supervisor is trying to get Air China to give us a refund.

Then they upgraded their planes with thinner seats and less recline, (unfortunately most airlines have made this upgrade).  I find it rather ironic that they did this, when every study on air rage, shows that more comfort (aka more leg room and seat recline), reduces stress and air rage. So they did the exact opposite of what every study said they should do. So not only have they made a long haul flight, less comfort able, the prices have also been steadily creeping upwards, (I used to buy first class for what you now pay in premium economy). As a whole, the cabin crew has always been great to me, but you always get the odd one who may be having a bad day and are a bit more abrasive. When Rouge first started flying, I never had an issue with missing or delayed baggage. The last 4 flights I have had missing/delayed bags.

When my sister and I checked in for the Santorini to Athens flights we had two rollerbags which were labeled cabin baggage on check in by Aegean. (A355 3 June) On our continuing flight to London (A3602 3 June), the gate agent stopped us and demanded that we pay 60 euros for one of our carryons despite the fact they were tagged by Aegean on our previous connecting flight. He would not let us on the plane unless we paid him. We finally paid to not hold up other travelers but in the confusion of this my purse was left on his counter. (not the main check in counter but the one to the side of the door where he collected the money). Immediately upon getting to my seat I noticed the purse missing. I asked the three stewardesses at the front of the plane if I could retrieve my purse at that counter. The man charging us the baggage fee at the last minute could also have run the purse down, and didn't. I could not leave the plane to go up the ramp but they did not offer for one of them to get it for me and instead waited for a young baggage boy to go see it it was there. What could have been accomplished in 5 minutes took at least 15 or more. He came back and said he did not see it. Literally, it was only 5 minutes from the time we got to our seat to when I could have had a stewardess check the countertop. The attendants could have called the gate but didn't or one of them gone to that counter, but they did not. On arrival at Heathrow, the departure agent called Athens for me and the purse was at lost and found with greek police at airport. They had it at the ticket check in stand after all! They gave me the reference number of 2294 and said to call DHL (maybe UPS) to have it couriered to me. I am not a business and have no way of putting the purse (small fabric dark grey shoulder bag 10 x 12"") in a box with a label which was suggested for pickup. Aegean Air, when contacted, said I would have to go through Greek lost and found and could offer no further assistance. I will pay if needed for it to be sent. I obviously am not in Athens and do not know anyone to pick the purse up for me there. The ticket agent in London was helpful but all of the numbers I have tried to reach since then either don't respond or give me another number that doesn't respond. He also said we should not have been charged the 60 euros at the last minute on the continuing flight. After calls and emails the airline finally did say they would credit the charge. It now has taken me five days and numerous long distance calls to get my purse returned.

Had been told it was the best way to the USA with pre clearance at Dublin. The day we travelled in October must have been Dublin Airports worst day as it took a full 2 hours in a queue to reach the immigration desks. My question is - has Dublin and Aer Lingus expansion into even more US cities started to affect the smooth running of this service? So needless to say everyone was stressed and flight departure times looming so hungry and thirsty we raced to our aircraft 1/4 full and an hours delay. No refreshments offered to those on board waiting and no interaction at all from crew. We had a relatively new A330-300 on our outbound journey which was generally pleasant and clean. Entertainment system poor. 1 hour into the flight we got a soft drink, only non-alcoholic beverages were complimentary. We then got our main meal and 3 or 4 hours in a small tub of ice cream was delivered. No other soft drinks service came round. Everyone kept walking up and down the aircraft trying to get water. I have never travelled long haul and had such poor service. The return journey was on an older A330-200 which was noticeably poorer. Bad sound on the entertainment system. Smaller screens and even worse if not poorer service. As it was a night flight the crew were even more absent and we felt like we were in a desert having to beg for liquid refreshment.

In particular the treatment of passengers by female flight crew members is rude and without any service attitude that you would even find in cheap European airlines. Multiple times the flight crew was bumping against the edge seats. Food was dashed off on the table without a word. When asked if a meat or vegatarian dish was available, the answer was ""no, thats out already"" and walking away, rather than ""no sorry, but may I offer . instead"". Coffee/tea was offered by shouting through the cabin ""coffee? tea??"" rather than asking ""would you like a coffee?"". I witnessed that behaviour with all passengers around us likewise. I have never seen such unpolite and rude behaviour in any other European, American or Asian airline carrier. On top of all of that, the return flight was delayed by 1.5 hrs so that we missed our connecting flight, resulting in a 5 hrs. delay of arrival at our final destination. The answer of Aeromexico whether they can offer a compensation was: ""we can offer a sincere apology"". Finally, the flight was not even expensive, but above average for that route. All in all, I will never travel with Aeromexico again, but will rather resort to well established European or Asian carriers.",Mexico City to Amsterdam,2,1,aeromexico,staff was very unpolite,Couple Leisure,Trip Verified,1,1,b41ac0ae-750b-4ed4-a7df-eca595af52ee
Boeing 787-9,Aeromexico,Economy Class,December 2019,19th December 2019,3,2,1,Germany,1,no,"AeroMexico from Mexico City to Amsterdam. As Ticket package i booked the ""Classic Package"", which included selecting a seat and luggage up to 23KG included (this package is ~70US$ more expensive, than the basic fare without luggage and seat reservation one-way!). I did the online-checkin-process, which went very smooth and chose my seat. One hour before departure i checked again in the customer-page, if everything was fine - it was and my seat was still blocked for me and the whole row (two more seats free). Until here everything was perfect. But then the boarding started.  My digital boarding pass on my smartphone was rejected several times, so the ground-stuff-guy went with me to the counter and gave me a printed boarding pass with another seat. I asked why they changed my seat without further announcement or communication to me, as passenger? After all i paid additional money, to choose my seat, but now the ground staff changed my seat. He just said, i shouldn't be so excited, it is exactly the same place, just in another part of the airplane. I again started discussing with him, that this behaviour is wrong, changing the booked and additionally paid seats of the customers - but he just turned around and went away. Consequently i ended on the seat directly in front of the toilets, where the seat recline was much less, than on my booked seat - sleeping was a torture for this overnight-connection. My original booked seat got a woman with a kid of about 12 years, they blocked obviously the three seats and laid flat down all the way to Amsterdam. But it is unbelievable, that people, who paid additional money for reserving a seat are removed and moved to another seat, while others, who didn't pay and reserve their seat before, get benefits for free. They could have gotten those seats, but then they needed to pay also additional money for getting this comfort. The stewardess in the airplane was completely incompetent. I showed her the two boarding-passes and she just said in a rude way, that my digital boarding pass is invalid and now i need to move. No offer for an upgrade to the premium-economy or business for this impudence. So, reserving seats against money is in AeroMexico no good option, you anyway have no guarantee to get your reserved and booked seat.

Because of renovations at Terminal 1 at México City airport we were forced to deplane using stairs and walk to a shuttle bus. I had a cane and was able with the help of my husband to get to the bus. The other lady, however, who was alone, received absolutely no help from flight attendants or ground crew to get down the stairs which she painfully managed by holding on to one rail with both hands and moving both legs onto each step. Once on the ground, she received no help either with walking to the bus or getting on the bus. Eventually, some other passengers helped her onto the bus and my husband gave up his seat for her while 2 ground employees occupied 2 seats. At the terminal I had to urge the said employees to help her off the bus and in the terminal was a wheelchair for her but not one for me despite having arranging on the ticket for one. This was despicable treatment of both flight and ground staff in ignoring the needs of a disadvantaged person. This is the second time we have transited via México City en route to another destination. A month ago we were travelling with Aeromexico from Vancouver to Panamá City and this was the return trip today. On the first occasion México City to Panamá City I had to walk down several flights of stairs from the gate to get to the bus and then climb upstairs onto the plane.

A representative at the gate refused to board our entire family of 5 people (including 6 yrs old daughter) because we passed on to him all 5 passports and boarding passes in one pile (like we usually do everywhere else in the World). Instead he wanted us to enclose each boarding pass into the corresponding passport. It took us about 20 seconds to do so. However the representative tried to send us back to the end of the line. Moreover while discussing he detached an immigration/visitors form from my son's boarding pass (we all have seen him doing so) and few minutes later he claimed we didn't submit the form and he has a right to cancel our flight. To my request to call for his manager and solve the problem hi simply replied 'I'm going to call for a police.

I land at Seattle, 6 hours in advance of my next flight's departure. I exit security and make my way to the Aer Lingus ticket counter. Which, as it turns out, isn't staffed. No problem! I think (foolishly). I'll just check in at a kiosk. Oddly enough, kiosk returns ""Flight is not open for check-in."" Okay, fine I go to check-in online. But my record locator isn't working, so I call customer service. I inform them I can't print my boarding passes. They give me a record locator and tell me to try checking in online. I try, and the ""Reprint boarding passes"" button is greyed out. Let's try the mobile app - nope, ""No issuing boarding passes"" error is returned. I call customer service again. Unapologetically, they tell me to just wait until they start staffing their single ticket counter at Seattle. They also tell me to try calling my travel agency (AmEx Global Travel, in this case, who I'd booked through). I call AmEx. They apologetically explain that they don't even have an agency dial-in to Aer Lingus they can call Aer Lingus but will get the same runaround as I did. The AmEx agents are always good people. Fine. I decide to chat with an Alaskan rep, who is friendly and tells me ""Yeah, Aer Lingus has a tendency to annoy a lot of travelers with their customer service approach."" This is 2019. ""Printing boarding passes"" is sort of a fundamental thing. The second rep I talked to on the phone told me ""We're going paperless,"" which would be great if literally any of their IT toolkits worked properly. The agents didn't know when the kiosks would be available for check-in. Nor could agents release the flight for me to check in again, or authorize re-fetching my boarding passes, or email them to me, or send them via SMS, or authorize their access with their mobile app. If you look at Google Reviews, you'll see that Aer Lingus has a well-deserved 1.2 stars out of 5 at SEATAC. I won't fly Aer Lingus again. Basic customer service can't and shouldn't really be ignored - due to them, I spent 3 hours sitting outside the security zone at SEATAC because none of their agents were either trained or had permission to actually distribute boarding passes.

,Air Berlin,Economy Class,January 2016,15th January 2016,0,3,1,Denmark,2,no,"It was my first flight with AirBerlin involving changing flights, from Budapest to Copenhagen via Berlin Tegel. It was a very disappointing experience. It started with the online checkin system, that did not work so I could not choose between seats. On both airplanes there were plenty of empty rows and seats but online it did not work to choose. The first flight from Budapest to Berlin was fine, luggage was checked in all the way - but when arriving in Berlin Tegel nobody had mentioned that I needed to change terminal myself, from the Airport's old main terminal to one of the new terminals far away and that I had to walk there myself plus needed to go through security again. Not a very pleasant transfer. And then landed in Copenhagen only to realize that the luggage had not come on the plane from Berlin. Plenty of other passengers had the same problem and ground service said that there was only 4 pieces of luggage with the plane. In their marketing Air Berlin tries hard to wash off their budget airline image by pointing to their world wide route net and collaboration with Etihad and other airliners. But it was one of my most unpleasant flights involving transfer ever, and it was really a budget airline trying to pretend being something else. For point to point flights they are fine.

The ground experience at NRT was excellent. Quick check-in, security and passport controls, great ANA lounge, priority boarding for Star Alliance gold members. Greetings while boarding was not particularly friendly and so was the service also on the flight to PVG. The food was more than ok for this 2h30 flight. The real odyssee began at Shanghai airport... There was no visible sign for international transfers so I asked my way and was told to go first to the fingerprints collection and then to the regular immigration line. When it was my turn, the customs officer told me to fill in a blue form (for long layover without visa!). After a while there were more and more people to Paris asked to do so. But then someone told us that it's not necessary and we were asked to follow her up to the (well hidden) international transfer counter where we waited about 20-30 minutes. We were around 25 passengers to Paris waiting there until someone came to exchange our boarding passes against new ones (why?). Then all of us had to go back to the immigration counters to get their boarding passes stamped.,  before going back to the international transfer counter again for our boarding passes and passports getting checked once again. After that we still had to go through the long lines of security control. The whole procedure took over 2 hours ! There should have been trained Air China staff to help customers and the airport staff should known the process of international to international transfers and give the right information. If you book international to international you should count on 3 hours transit to be on the safe side. Our aircraft to Paris was on an apron position and we had to take a crowded bus: chaotic to board a large plane with only one stairway. FA were not particularly friendly but the service was quick and OK for a budget airline. The seats were also OK and the entertainment sytem also. We arrived slightly delayed in Paris. I wrote them a friendly e-mail to complain about the disastrous transfer in PVG and I received a short answer: 3 lines in very poor english. Not really giving the impression they care about frequent flyers and Star Alliance gold members. The ticket was cheap and for a very cheap price I would fly them again but only for a direct flight to China, not with an international transfer.

The price was great and I wanted to give the airline a chance and fly with them for the 1st time. Tickets not booked on their website: not able to choose seats or special meals. I contacted the airline per e-mail and I could order one special meal. I checked in the day before departure to be sure we sit together. Seating was 3-3-3 on the B777 if I'm right: better than the 3-4-3 on some airlines. Check-in opened around 3 hours before departure: the economy class line was very long. I'm Star Alliance Gold member and I could use the business class: pretty fast and checkin staff in Paris very friendly. But the seats I had checked in for the day before were not available anymore and I ended up on a middle seat. Boarding began 30 minutes later but we arrived on time at Beijing airport.  I was positively surprised about the service onboard. Well, it's just a short version of the service of Lufthansa, Turkish or ANA and they don't come as often with drinks during and after the service you get plastic cutlery,... but it's OK for the price! The food was not a highlight but not bad. The flight attendants mostly friendly with a good understanding of english. They are quick to serve but don't expect too much interaction like you have with ANA or Lufthansa... They are here to serve not to answer questions. Inflight entertainment a bit old, not very responding, froze and had to be reset. The problem was the transfer from international to international: expect long lines for passport control (yes, they do have one) and security check. And no special line for gold members, business class. The line was huge and disorganized. Passengers with a European passports were eventually asked to bypass the main ine and line up for the automatized passport control, which was much quicker. Afterwards again disorganised line for security control. Lighters and larger power banks are not allowed. All electronic equipment (also Bluetooth headphones !) and wallets/purses had to be taken out of the bag... unfriendly staff. You should always calculate at least one hour and half for connecting flights. There is no smoking area at PEK airport, keep in this in mind if you book a long transit time. Air China business / gold lounge pretty full but OK (for the price again). The airport has several restaurants and many shops and is modern with big windows over the apron. Boarding to Tokyo HND began on time. The service for a 3 hour flight was good and quick, but not so friendly. The A321 was dirty: not only my tray table was dirty with stains (food, sauce?) and also the overhead bins and panels had grey stains. We arrived on time. Business class passengers and gold members didn't get their luggage before normal economy passengers. Overall I would say you pay for what you get.

The issue in question involves a flight from Puerto Vallarta to Mexico City and a roundtrip from there to Quito, Ecuador before a final flight to Seattle. After landing in Mexico City for the layover, my next flight was cancelled due to unrest in Quito. Aeromexico issued a travel alert saying that they would not be charging for fare differences or change fees to handle the matter. They also advised me at the airport that they would not be flying into Quito for 5 days. As I was in now stranded in Mexico City, I asked to be put on the next plane to Seattle. This was all transacted in Spanish, which I am not completely proficient in. I expressed concern about making sure I was securing the value of my flight, and they prompted me to call the 1-800 number for the Houston office when I returned to settle that matter. As their travel alert read, I still have the roundtrip value of the ticket from Mexico City to Quito available to book. I called the Houston office on my return to Seattle to be told that I had already agreed to an itinerary change and there was nothing that they could do. They referred me to the complaint department (email only) to handle the matter. After asking for the value of my round trip MXC-Quito segment of my flight to be rebooked, it took almost a full week and a second email to receive a ticket number from them and another five days (and another follow up email) to receive their curt response detailing my implicit forfeiture of my trip value when I agreed to fly back to Seattle from Mexico City part way through this interrupted trip. They also said that I was not on the same flight or cabin and that the value of my trip to Quito was used to cover the difference. I do not see how this could be the case as I paid to upgrade my seats on all four flights in this trip and was still in coach on the return segment to Seattle. I received no print out showing how the value was distributed. So I'm told both that I agreed to sacrifice the value of my ticket, but that loss was implicit. Nothing about the scenario was explicit except their travel alert online which I was in the bounds of, and thus their decision on this matter seems only to be made in a cost-benefit to themselves. I find this sort of service disingenuous. The worst part of their email was the final statement: ""thank you for making Aeromexico the carrier of your choice."" I WILL NOT CHOOSE AEROMEXICO IN THE FUTURE - likely choosing Avianca or any number of similar operators along similar routes. Although when first using this airline I enjoyed the service and availability of routes, the double-talk between their official travel alerts, and their email-only handling of complaints in a non-customer-centric fashion leaves a lot to be desired by this airline.

They even helped to make space and store carry on bags in the overheard compartments so the flight could leave as soon as possible. They even hand out candy before take off which makes a nice touch of a warm Greek welcome. There's a complementary meal or snack provided depending on the flight time with a selection of drinks.

Aegean are focusing on their in-flight quality of service which is indeed very good. On the other hand their prices can be high even for short distance flights and their Miles & Bonus scheme is a joke. Although I have accumulated a great deal of spending miles, it seems I cannot spend any since in order to find free slots, I have to foresee a trip many months before and it has to not fall within their busy periods, making it pretty impossible to spend them. Even if you want to use the miles to fly 2-3 months ahead, you have to be willing to fly with other star alliance carriers and through other destinations (transit), hence doubling your flight time and hassle. I am a silver card holder (need one more flight to become gold), and I am entitled to 2 upgrades per year from economy to business class. Whenever I try to use these upgrades there never seem to be any available slots/seats. Then a year passes and these vouchers expire.

I arrived at the airport early because I had a meeting cancelled. I saw there was a flight to LHR leaving an hour earlier than my flight to LHR. I went to the gate and asked if I could get on this earlier flight and they said no sorry it is full. So I went across the way and bought a snack. I then heard them paging five passengers for the flight as it was closing. I went up and asked again about getting on this flight and the person said it is not his call and pointed at another person who just looked at me and continued what he was doing. I left again and they then paged twice more for the missing passengers. I then went up again and asked if I could get on this flight as these missing passengers will likely want my seat on the later flight. He looked at me and said he cannot as he closed the flight five minutes ago. I said do you would rather have it go with a few empty seats? He said I can’t do anything I closed it already. It really baffles me why an airline would not do everything it can to go full and to have had an extra seat for these missing passengers who would likely need it. Not to mention the carbon footprint of not having a full plane. It seems that people at the gate were empowered to act for the best and now they just tick the boxes and don’t care about it look at the bigger picture.

Only after queued for over 30 min, in the place close to the counter, there are signs indicating what the queue is for.

Flying domestically in Russia is relatively inexpensive: my ticket was 7000 rubles, roughly 116 USD at the current exchange rate. A similar flight in the US would be 2 to 3 times as expensive and with about the same experience. As always, boarding the plane with Aeroflot is chaotic. Announcements are few, if any. There is no particular order for boarding by zones, so people queue up early. Both flights were at or very near capacity. The flight to Tyumen was uncomfortable, the cabin temperature so warm that I was sweating on the plane. The return flight to Moscow was a little better, but the cabin temperature was still warm. Seats were cramped with very little leg room on this B737-800. Both flights had in-flight meal consisting of a sandwich, small fruit bar, and a mandarin orange, but considering it was only a 2.5 hour flight getting anything in economy/coach is a bonus. The flight attendants were professional but not particularly cordial. Arriving in Moscow Sheremetovo we had to wait in a holding pattern due to a heavy snowstorm, but still landed on time. We had to descend from a mobile platform and board a bus to take us from the tarmack to the terminal, and with the snow it was a bit slippery.

My only reason to write this review is to warn other Skyteam members not to fly with Aeroflot. From booking to flight, aside from the planes being relatively new and a lower price than the poor standard Chinese airlines there is no other reason to fly with them. Despite being a Platinum member I was unable to book any economy comfort seats nor even an exit seat, they are all blocked for Aeroflot members only - and on the London to Moscow leg all the exit seats were empty and we were not allowed to move to them. On the 9.5 hour Beijing leg there are no extra legroom seats as they are only available on the 777's, so you are on an aircraft that most airlines use on medium haul with only 30 inches legroom - the cabin was crammed with people all over the place and as normal rather large people at that with legs in the aisles. Check-in was supposed to start at 7.40 but we waited until 8am whilst listening to the staff stories about the night before whilst they drank their coffee, the start of abysmal service displayed throughout the entire journey. Flight left 1 hour late and then at Moscow was delayed again by 1.15 whilst they de-iced the wings. The food was not only poor it was inedible, and I had the same AVML meal on both legs plus no alcohol at all, and when questioned all I got was a curt ""we never have any"" reply. Why on earth not? There is no religious reason on flights to China and even China Eastern has 2 bottles of red and white. Lounges were typical Eastern European, absolutely packed and with no hot food whatsoever, I managed to find some coleslaw and sweet bread plus some Chilean wine to keep me going as I'd eaten nothing for over 6 hours. Entertainment system was zero on the flight from London, not even a communal TV nor any music, and on the Beijing flight it kept breaking down.

Wooed by the promise of ""more personal space, an exclusive in-flight menu, and preferential treatment"", I chose to fly Aeromexico's business class on the popular Cancun-Mexico City route. Things started going downhill at check-in when I was told there was no lounge service, even though my terminal had a contract VIP lounge that could easily have been commissioned by Aeromexico. While it had been a very long time since I had flown business class with an airline that didn't offer a lounge service, I expected the on-board catering - which Aeromexico promised would be ""premium hors d'oeuvres, drinks and in-flight menu"" - would help make up for the disappointment. How wrong was I? I was appalled to learn that the nice lunch I was reasonably hoping for would consist of nuts and a selection of junk food like chocolate bars and potato crisps. After being completely misled by Aeromexico's advertising, I was left hungry by the time I arrived in Mexico City two and a half hours later and feeling as though I had been taken for a fool.

Boeing 737-800,Aeromexico,Economy Class,October 2019,10th October 2019,0,0,3,UnitedStates,1,no,"As most of you already know, AeroMexico partners with Delta. So, we booked our trip to Mexico through Delta Vacations (that part went perfectly, as usual). We not only booked our flights but we chose to go with Aeromexico on the way back. Partially because it went through Mexico City and we had an overnight stay and it was an airline we had not flown with before. To put things in perspective, we have flown with several other Delta partners in the past and have had zero issues (matter of fact, they were great! KLM, Air France, etc.). So, we thought that this would be the same type of experience and of course a new adventure. We were so incredibly wrong! We booked our flights in mid-June for the beginning of October and our seating assignments and everything were set to go (they were first class seats). Two days before our flight we checked both Aeromexico and Delta and the Delta seating arrangement was correct (nothing had changed) but Aeromexico had moved our seats (on both flights) to the very front of the plane, which we do not like because there is no place to put your hand carry (personal) bags so you have to put them above. Since Aeromexico was for a trip back we were told after spending over an hour on the phone that they would not change our seats until 24 to 48 hours before. This was interesting to us because they had already changed our seating on both flights to the front of the plane (without any warning). From what we understand after speaking with our Delta representative (because Aeromexico was almost impossible to get in touch with) this had been the second change they made to our seating without advising us or even giving us the option to choose. So now sitting in Cancun, Mexico (wasting more of our vacation) 24 to 48 hours before our flight back, we checked Aeromexico. To our great surprise, they had not only moved us again but this time out of first class and into the main cabin, which would be fine if that’s what we had paid for. So again (while on vacation), we get on the phone and waste our time with Aeromexico. Then after no resolution or better said waiting on the phone (eternal hold). We called Delta again, this call took an hour and a half and the Delta Representative was told by Aeromexico (the first time he called) that they would change us to a different flight. Then, after 15 minutes of no changes the Delta representative called back and he was told that not only would they not change our flights but if we wanted our old seats back or a different flight that we would have to pay. Of course, we refused (Who in their right mind would hand over more money?). We asked the Delta representative what his response was to them and he said that he took it to their management and they also refused saying the same thing. What it appeared to us is that Aeromexico was trying to upcharge us for services we already purchased. This should be brought up to the Aeromexico corporate headquarters, and used as training and a teaching tool on how to not treat your customer. Because we fly so much with Delta and because we think they’re just a better airline, the Delta Vacations representative took us off of the Aeromexico flights and found us flights home on Delta (for no additional cost and the same day!). We would not and could not recommend Aeromexico to anyone at any time for anything. Moreover, we are actually shocked that they remain in business with these types of unethical practices and behaviors.",Cancun to San Antonio ,3,3,aeromexico,Aeromexico had moved our seats,Couple Leisure,Not Verified,3,0,adf23191-735e-495b-92c1-5f36c1e901df
Boeing 787-8,Aeromexico,Economy Class,May 2019,7th October 2019,3,3,3,UnitedKingdom,7,yes,"London to Tuxtla Guitierrez via Mexico City earlier this year. Overall, I was pleasantly surprised by Aeromexico, although my trip did not get off to the best start as their booking system is atrocious. Specifically, when booking multi-city trips (rather than a direct return), the website does not give you a choice of different economy fare classes, but just the one ""tourist class"" option. When clicking through to the payment page, the website tells you that one checked bag is included in the fare. However, once payment was made, the ticket sent to me said no bag was included! A check of the fare class rules confirmed this was correct, but the booking page was highly misleading. I then had to pay GBP 50 each way extra to check a bag. Not the end of the world given how cheap the original fare was, but this was poor for a supposedly professional company. I complained about this to the cheery check-in agent, who apologised but merely replied ""sorry, the website is terrible, isn't it?"" Not good enough! However, things picked up from there. The flight out was only 1/3 full in economy, so almost everyone had a row to themselves. I could stretch out across 3 seats and get a proper night's sleep. Flight was on time, crew were friendly and food was OK if not great. IFE had good, up to date film options on a decent screen. One of the best economy flights I have had - only complaint was a funny smell that appeared in the cabin from time to time. On the return leg, check in and security at Tuxtla was very efficient - it's a tiny airport. Domestic leg on an E195 was uneventful, although a longer flight than planned due to very high levels of traffic at MEX. Connection at MEX was seamless as there are no exit checks/passport control for domestic-international connections in Mexico. MEX terminal 2 is architecturally pretty cool and not a bad place to spend a couple of hours. Return flight to London was unfortunately completely full with no spare seats, so not as pleasant as the outward leg. There was also a delay of around an hour and a half after boarding whilst a technical problem was fixed, but captain kept us well informed and crew were friendly once more. Once in the air, food service was again OK and despite the busy flight I could get some sleep (the Boeing 787 is in my opinion one of the best planes to fly long haul, along with the A350, due to the better pressurisation/lighting and quieter cabin). The one annoying thing about this flight was the lack if responsiveness of the IFE screen. It kept trying to call an attendant instead of begin a film, or turn the reading light on instead of the flight map .. highly bizarre and irritating! So overall, I'd say Aeromexico were pretty decent and I'd certainly fly them again (especially at the price I paid), but there are certainly a few areas for improvement.",London to Tuxtla Guitierrez via Mexico City,4,3,aeromexico,I'd certainly fly them again,Solo Leisure,Trip Verified,5,0,b6bec85c-500f-4bdb-9fef-602fb497ba69

This airline does not offer phone support other than for very basic assistance like sales. Everything else must be through email. However, my issue is they don't respond to their email. I asked for a tax to be refunded that I was never supposed to be charged as I was exempt from this tax, as well as a refund for a phone booking fee that I was not notified about until after the charge was completed. They responded to me that ¨everyone is notified about the phone charge, and that the tax would not be refunded¨. I replied on August 28th clarifying which tax I was referring to, I also asked them to review the call recording as they would hear that I inquired about the phone fee to be refunded while I was on the phone with the representative. The sales agent did not mention the fee. I inquired with him about the fee after seeing it on the receipt in my email. He told me the only way to receive a refund was to email the complaints department. This was during the sale, not in another interaction. Furthermore, I would have never made a phone reservation but their online booking system was having an issue and the error message told me I needed to call to complete the reservation. For this reason alone they should have refunded me that fee. However, I received no response to this email. I emailed again September 17th, to let them know that I was injured in an accident and would not be able to make the flight. I emailed them a medical certificate, and photos of my injuries, and I requested that they provide either a refund or a credit to be used on a future flight. They couldn't even be bothered to reply with a ¨no¨. Just no response at all. I later realized that my Visa Infinite card that I made the payment on came with trip insurance, so I filed a claim with my insurance company. My insurance company requested a letter from the airline stating that the trip was canceled. The airline did send this. However, after I submitted the letter to my insurance, my insurance company requested that the letter also include additional details. I requested a revision to the letter on September 23rd. However, once again, I received no response. Despite being routinely ignored by this business the only thing I am asking for is a document confirming 1. the cancellation of the flight, 2. the amounts reimbursed and the fines charged OR indicating that there will be no refund.

By far, Air Canada Rouge is the worst airline I have flown in years. Even compared to other countries ultra budget airlines, AC Rouge sets the standard for negligence and incompetence. I will elaborate, on a beautiful October day, flight from Toronto to Calgary was originally scheduled to leave at 12.30pm ET. It left well over 2.5 hours later. The first aircraft at the gate was delayed by 30 mins due to ""technical issues"", which turned out to be caused by the baggage compartment doors being stuck. Only after an additional 30 minutes, did they move folks over to an adjacent gate, and different aircraft. Once the people from that flight had all disembarked, including the flight crew (which took about 20 minutes), we all waited another 30 minutes in line while some of the staff were scrambling to switch folks over, and others were standing around doing nothing or talking on their cell phones. Once everyone was on board and settled in, the Captain announced over the intercom that it would be yet another 40 minutes until catering arrived and stocked the aircraft!

The staff were getting agitated as they constantly had to tend to the faulty coffee machine and the passengers were lining up to get served. It was a total waste of money as I would have had access to much better options in the terminal for the price I paid to enter the lounge. Boarding was orderly but commenced late resulting in a late departure. As I was boarding, the gate agent stopped me to tell me my carry-on had to be checked in which I went along with. Once on-board, I watched other passengers come through with more items and much bigger carry-ons than mine. The seats had poor pitch and I was glad I had paid extra for exit row. FA’s were pleasant but the service offering was abysmal with everything from water to coffee costing extra. It felt more like a discount rather than a mainline carrier.

All three flights were delayed leaving: First Flight: two and a quarter hours delay taking off because of a fuel light fault (this should have been sorted before we boarded and sat there all that time - preventable) Second Flight: an hour late leaving owing to a staff shortage for that flight (this should have been sorted out before we boarded - preventable) Third Flight: 15 minutes late leaving because of a late boarding passenger (not really Rouges fault).

The flight was delayed (not the airlines fault) but the crew did not seem to be interested in the comfort of staff. On several occasions elderly passengers struggled to place their luggage in the overhead bin and received no assistance from crew who stood by and watched. I was surprised by this as I usually they always assist. Due to the delay in take off the connection time in Athens would be shorter than normal. At this point, as always, I was not worried as Aegean usually does a excellent job in handling connection flights.

To make it worse she then decided to start sprinting and was shouting at everyone you have to run! Run or you will not make it.

Never have I experienced such rude behavior and such unnecessary stress. As a connection ambassador she should have known that there was time and that we would have easily made it to the gate with time left to spare. Instead everyone was pushed to walk at a fast pace with people struggling and no one taking notice. Aegean needs to review this and ensure the ground staff offer a good connecting experience with staff making sure everyone reaches their next flight in comfort.

A320,Aegean Airlines,Business Class,September 2018,27th September 2018,0,0,1,UnitedStates,3,no,"Thessaloniki to Athens. We checked in just fine, gave our luggage in, went through security and arrived at the Aegean lounge within minutes. We had booked a separate seat for our son with the intention of using a car seat for him. When we showed out boarding passes to the nice lady that greeted us in the lounge we inquired about pre-boarding for families. She did not know anything about it and simple said that we would be boarding from the lounge area when an announcement is made. We also inquired about gate checking the stroller and receiving it for use at our connecting airport in Athens she did in fact state that we could take the elevator down to the bus which would take us to the aircraft for boarding and that there we could gate check the stroller to be given back to us when we arrive at the gate in Athens. When the time came we heard the announcement for boarding for our flight and as we gave our boarding passes to the same lady that greeted us on the way in, she scanned them, checked our passports and asked us to wait next to the door to take us to the elevator. After all passengers went through the door, we were asked to follow her to the elevator to find that there was a line there of approx. 6 passengers in wheel chairs waiting to use it. Also the bus that all other passengers boarded was waiting on us. At this point she asked if we could carry the child in hand to walk the stairs down to the bus, and she offered to carry the stroller down as well. Although I did appreciate the offer, this was not an ideal situation. When we got to the bus, I was holding our son, my wife was holding carry on luggage and I had to manage a folded stroller as well, all while standing in a moving bus. Perhaps if as they advertised had offered proper pre-boarding for families with young children these things could go a bit smoother. We arrived at the aircraft and gave the stroller to the person standing at the bottom of the stairs, to be returned to us when we arrived in Athens. Got on board the aircraft, started installing the car seat for my son, which thankfully did not take long. We were told by the staff on board that the child would have to be sitting on either mine or my wife's lap for take-off and landing and they provided us with a seat belt extension to use for this. As in a previous flight, I did not argue with the staff and complied. Lufthansa did not have any issues with the use of a car seat used during take-off and landing. In any case the safest place for a child under the age of 2, is securely fastened in a car seat with a 3 point harness. When we arrived at Athens and de-boarded, we asked for our car seat and they were searching for it, while the bus to take us to the terminal was waiting for us. Took them a few minutes, but they found it. One last thing that I would like to point out is the fact that the plane was late departing from Thessaloniki, and that we had a connecting flight from Athens which we barely made thanks this. The thing that made this situation even worse was the fact that the bus driver delivered us to a door all the way on the other end of the terminal were we had to go.",Thessaloniki to Athens,3,3,aegean-airlines,pre-boarding for families,Family Leisure,Trip Verified,2,0,d366216d-46bd-47c1-83e4-d084a5665271
A320,Aegean Airlines,Business Class,August 2018,27th September 2018,0,1,1,UnitedStates,2,no,"Munich to Thessaloniki. This was the first time we flew with our infant son and were really excited to be flying with Aegean as in the past we have had a very good experience with them. This time around though it was not so pleasant. We had booked three seats (all business) so that we could place a car seat on board for our 14 month old son. We expected to be boarding before all others in the plane thus having plenty of time to put our things away and to install the car seat in the seat and securing our son. This was not the case. When it came time to board they announced boarding for business class customers so a whole lot of people lined up in front of us - no pre-boarding for families was offered as advertised on their website. When we got into the jet-way we were greeted by an Aegean Airlines employee who asked us about the car seat being checked to the final destination. We explained that we had purchased a seat for this, he demanded to see 4 boarding passes. Yes - 4 boarding passes, one for me, one for my wife, one for my son, and one for the car seat. I remember thinking you have got to be kidding me. After a few minutes of explaining to him that we had purchased 3 seats and one was for an infant with the intention of using a car seat for safety and after he said he had to check with the staff on board we were allowed to board. All 3 of us (or 4 of us according to that employee). So at this point all other passengers were boarding, so I had to wait for the car seat install until all passengers were on board - not an ideal situation. Furthermore we were told that we could not use the car seat during take-off and landing and the child had to sit on either myself or my wife using a seat belt attachment which they provided. At this point I was really not in any mood to argue with anyone and I did as they requested. We had our son sitting on our lap for take-off and landing instead of him being safely secured in car seat with a 3-point harness. Let me point on that this was a connecting flight for us from NYC which we flew Lufthansa and they had no issues with our son sitting in his car seat safely secured, yet Aeagean Airlines employees thought it to be unsafe due to regulations.",Munich to Thessaloniki,3,2,aegean-airlines,not so pleasant,Family Leisure,Trip Verified,2,0,48eb8979-eb03-4c9e-b7cf-824b2e9a176b

Aer lingus gave me the worst travel experience I've ever seen in over 30 years of frequent flying. tldr: Last minute flight cancellation, no reroute options, rude and slow customer service and non transparent and misguiding compensation and refund policy. Details: I booked a flight from Seattle to Faro connecting in Boston and Dublin to attend a wedding. The flight was supposed to land in Terminal 2 at 7 AM which as per the Irish department of justice website will not require entry into Ireland. ""Unless your arrival flight and onward connecting flight is in Terminal 2 between the hours of 0400 and 1600, you will need to go landside to make your onward connecting flight"". First, my initial flight from Seattle was cancelled hours before departure. I accidentally checked my email before heading to the airport and found the notification. I called their customer support and was kept on hold for 90 mins, the customer service agent was rude and offered a reroute that arrives 2 days after my initial arrival date, which meant I will miss the main purpose of the trip and attend the wedding I am supposed to. When I asked him for an earlier option, he placed me on hold again and phone was disconnected after a min. I called again and waiting around 60 mins on hold again before I was automatically disconnected again. I called for a third time and finally got to an agent after almost 80 mins. She gave me another ticket that exchanged my 12 hour flight for a 24 hour flight with 10 hour wait in Boston. I accepted the offer since I had no other choice. Second: I did fly to Boston through a JetBlue flight and the agent did check me in and routed my luggage directly to Faro airport. I arrived in Boston and waited the 10 hours during which I checked in again with an aer lingus agent who checked my passport and gave me a boarding pass and explicitly marked ""Visa OK"" on it after asking me a number of time where my final destination is. At the gate, the agent asked all passengers to check in at the desk to confirm luggage. I did and he checked my passport and issued me a new boarding pass . An hour later, I was not allowed to board to the plane by the aer lingus agent as I don't have a transit visa to Dublin. I spent the next hours running from Jetblue agents to Aer lingus agents who exchanged blame in a rude and humiliating manner. Even calling Aer lingus support line didn't help. Eventually they offered to return me back to Seattle using my $1360 ticket. As a result, I missed my vacation and didn't attend my best friend's wedding, I lost the $1360 ticket and $2000 of hotel reservations, car rentals and other arrangements After almost one week, Aer lingus did not reply to my claim for refund or compensation, although the regulations mentioned on their website explicitly mention my right for compensation in case of one side cancellation.",Boston to Faro via Dublin,0,0,aer-lingus,did not reply to my claim for refund,Solo Leisure,Trip Verified,1,0,fc47f424-38e8-423f-b6b2-6695ad1f45af

The return trip on November 29th from SVO to LHR was, however, mediocre, even allowing for my class of travel (economy). The cabin crew seemed to have an indifferent attitude, in stark contrast to the outbound flight. One flight attendant tried to tell me in a peremptory way to sit down again once we had arrived, even though the plane had come to a complete stop at the gate and the engines had been switched off a few minutes before. The flight took off from SVO with a delay of over an hour, which was explained as the result of a technical problem. However, no detailed explanation, which would have been useful, was given, and the cabin staff did not know the reason, which they should have done, I suspect it was an APU issue, as the cabin was freezing until the engines were started. Nevertheless, the captain managed to reduce the delay to 45 minutes by arrival. One significant advantage of flying Aeroflot is the Moscow airport it uses, Sheremetyevo.

A320,Aer Lingus,Economy Class,August 2019,13th August 2019,0,2,2,Ireland,7,yes,"Dublin to Bologna. I shall start by saying that I booked the flight many months ahead of my planned holiday. I booked with a travel agency and because of this Aer Lingus would not let me access their site to reserve a seat of my choice. Due to a medical issue I like an aisle seat. Eventually the Aer Lingus call centre let me pay for a seat. I was able to check-in online a few days before departure. The bag drop in Dublin was efficient and worked well. At present, Dublin is undergoing expansion and building work. I found myself placed on a transfer bus from one building to another and then entered what looked like an annex at the far end of the airport to stand number 35. So because of this passengers for this flight formed two sets of queues consecutively. One then had to walk towards the aircraft and passengers were left waiting in an exposed area for almost 15 mins. I did not see any assistance for elderly people, the frail or disabled people. The cabin crew were friendly, they made sure they presented the safety routine with a sense of purpose. The interior of the cabin was spotlessly clean. During this flight drinks and snacks were available for purchase. It was nice to see a native Italian speaker on the crew as most of the passengers were Italian people. The flight was just over 2 hours. During this time the captain only spoke twice and on both occasions he spoke so rapidly nobody could understand a word he said! There was no route map and the inflight magazine was ripped and tattered. The lavatory was clean. I noted that 2 of the cabin crew sat at the back of the flight for the duration of the journey and did little and allowed their colleagues to do all of the work. Disembarkation was quick and efficient. This direct flight is very convenient. There is a cheaper alternative with another airline. However. Aer Lingus has a more convenient departure time and by buying well in advance the price was reasonable for high season travel. Overall a rather reasonable experience. My concern though was the experience in Dublin airport and the lack of visible help for mobility impaired passengers. With all the building work going on better signage is needed too. A nice touch quite a few passengers commented on was the use of the Irish language. This is important in promoting Irish culture and heritage by the Irish national carrier. The aircraft used was an A320 and it was in the lovely dark green Aer Lingus colours rather than the new cut-back livery. I recommend Aer Lingus for their friendly and hardworking staff but with the proviso that they improve their communication in the airport.

Service: only a bottle of water laid on the seat with no pre-flight drink service like other ""business class"" offerings from other airlines. The wine, if one wants to call it that, was barely drinkable and I chose the pasta meal choice because the curry from the butter chicken was making me nauseous and I was in row 1! The crew did the mandatory service of drinks followed by lunch then a snack before landing. However, in between all of this there was hardly any follow-up with the premium class passengers. They were more concerned with ensuring that the curtain from the cabin to the galley was shut solid with the velcro closures.

I accepted and I took one of the bags to Egyptair and checked it on whilst leaving the other with their supervisors to check in so I didn’t have to pay a fine for an extra bag. This bag was left in with them to send on the same flights and meet me in Luxor. The bag didn’t arrive plus I didn’t have any ticket for the bags to trace. I started the very very long and painful process of trying to find my bag via email. This was 7 weeks ago. Every week I get the same generic email that says they are at my disposal and want to help. Finally yesterday I had an email telling me to go to Luxor airport and get my bags proving me with ticket references. I arrive at Luxor airport only to find they have provided the ticket of the bags from London to Athens which are shown as claimed. But their email states this are from Athens to Luxor. This is the most ridiculous situation I’ve ever encountered.

I was not getting a bus at that hour as I was exhausted and would not have been able to get to my home from knock at that hour so got a taxi to my friend and the next day had to get a bus to knock so I arrived in knock at 22.35 on the 11th 28 hours after I should have arrived at knock airport.

,Aer Lingus,Economy Class,July 2019,7th July 2019,3,3,1,UnitedStates,2,no,"Chicago to Amsterdam via Dublin. This review is a long time coming. I’d like to start off on a positive note. Betty and her colleagues working at the check-in desk at O’Hare on the evening of June 27, 2019 were life savers. These women went above and beyond to help me get on an earlier transfer flight, and deserve to be acknowledged. Unfortunately, all other circumstances surrounding my trip were nightmare-ish.  I chose to fly them again due to the cost and convenience from Chicago. During my last trip with Aer Lingus my luggage was lost during a connection from Dublin to Rome. Hours and hours were spent on the phone with essentially no help. The only reason I recovered my bag was pure luck. I went to the airport to see if miraculously my bag made it on the same flight the next day and it did. Albeit, it was sitting in the middle of the airport and no one ever contacted me that it had arrived! I received zero compensation for this inconvenience despite submitting a claim to the airline.  I booked with Aer Lingus again after the last disaster because the price was significantly less, and the in-flight experience is not terrible compared to some airlines. First, plans changed prior to my departure and the customer service line was worthless. Prepare to be on hold for an hour and then speak with an operator that is prepared to do nothing to assist you. If you must fly this airline and run into an issue with your departure, the only option is to work with personnel at the origin airport directly. Additionally, the check in process at every airport (aside from O’Hare) has been run with zero efficiency. At my recent check in departing from Amsterdam back to the USA, there were two employees working the desk. A family was dealing with an issue and it held up the line for an hour. It would have made much more sense to have them step aside and work with them after the majority of passengers had checked in. The line system itself is also ridiculous. There were two lines marked “check in” and “bag drop” but since most flyers were unable to check in online (another annoyance), it was unclear if there was any differentiation in the line. This created much discord between the passengers waiting and arguments as to whose turn was next. Although I arrived at the airport with almost three hours to spare, given the check-in snafu, I felt I had to rush through security and customs. As such, I did not check my boarding pass and only realized while arriving at security that the agent did not print out a boarding pass for my transfer flight. I rushed to the gate to inquire whether they could print a pass there because of the error at check-in. They told me that they could not assist me and my only option was to re-check in at the Dublin airport. I have an hour and 35 minute layover and also have to go through US customs, so how will this be feasible? Further, now our flight is delayed and there is a very solid chance I will miss my connection back to a Chicago. All in all, do your best to avoid flying this airline at all costs. The consistent terrible service and inefficiency you will encounter every step of the way is not worth any amount of savings.",Chicago to Amsterdam via Dublin,3,3,aer-lingus,now our flight is delayed,Solo Leisure,Not Verified,2,0,34849adc-a61f-4b73-80a0-b391391b45a0

After that we where told we would have to wait until Friday to get a flight and get to Mexico. No compensation for hotels food or lost luggage they finally got us a flight Wednesday night to Calgary and told us there was a flight Thursday morning to Mexico and once we got to Calgary go to the agent and book it with them. Once we arrived in Calgary there was no flights again until Friday and we had to Find a hotel for 5 people and get there and wait till Friday. Which means we have lost 2 days of our vacation. We were told in Toronto Calgary would be able to help with compensation of hotels once we got there NOT TRUE. once we and the 3 kids where settled in our hotel I started contacting Aeromexico where I was told we could change our return dates with no charge and she put me on hold then there was no one when I called back I was told not possible and to contact west jet. West would not do anything and told me to call Aeromexico and they said no should have got the first agent to change the dates and this new agent would not do it and said he didn’t feel it was necessary. I tried explaining he was being unfair and the first agent said she would and that we where protected. However he wouldn’t. So I contacted red tag and delt with an agent who told me no problem to change our return dates so we could have our full time she said she needed to call me back however never did. So then I ran out of time and we left for Mexico.

When the date comes we get to the airport and the girl who checked us in never mentioned or asked us about this permit when checking our documentation. She only asked us for our USA visa and our Canadian visa which we had. After we get to Mexico City and the same thing happened. Nobody told us about this permit even though they knew about the final destination was Honduras. When we got to Honduras the Migration agent didn’t let us in as my husband didn’t have this permit. So we went to claim the airline for letting us get to that point without notifying us what we needed when checking our documentation and all we received was a very bad attitude, unprofessional and disrespectful like we owe them something. The information we got from every single person that we talked to was inconsistent and they kept avoiding responsibility and telling us that it was migration fault to not let us in. Which is ridiculous. Another guy at Mexico City told us that the airline was not responsible to ask the passengers Or check if their travel documentation were in order.

To be honest, though, a spare wheel must be available on site. I don’t know much about flying a plane but it would seem pretty basic to me! Communication and clarification were sparse at best. Lost sheep - I know what they are now! No hotels booked, no details of the alternative flight, no plan made for any person in that flight (except the Aer Lingus staff who headed off to their pre-booked hotels). I will add that those on the flight included the elderly, infirm and wheelchair bound. It’s 1 am and entire flight left to our own devices to survive a late night in Lisbon. About 50 people slept on the airport floor, no water, no blankets. An €18 meal voucher received at about 1 pm on June 30th.

The level of customer service is pathetic and unacceptable. I am annoyed that we could not have been told last night to arrive at a more reasonable hour. According to Ground Force in Lisbon there was never a slot available to fly at 2pm. In all of this time, there was no sign of any Aer Lingus staff. Ground Force may be contracted by Aer Lingus as airport admin but to be honest, we would deserve better than this! Aer Lingus did issue a message saying that air traffic control had restricted their ability to make a departure at 2 pm. Lisbon airport ground control told us there was no such slot available! Why can’t people tell the truth? Seemingly no slot was available and so I find myself sitting unnecessarily at the airport unable to even check in!

I flew Aer Lingus just to transfer airports to the actual airline I booked through. Because of this third party booking I could not use the kiosk to print my boarding pass. I asked the woman at the kiosk for help and she told me to use the kiosk, when I explained the issue she told me that the kiosk was the only way to print my boarding pass. I tried to get help at the ticketing counter and was told they could not help because I had already purchased a ticket. By this point I was an hour and fifteen minutes into the process. I then stood in another line to get help from the baggage drop. Two people in a row went on break as I got to the front of the line leaving one person to help close to 200 people still in line.

Next door, there is a far better lounge. After that my flight was delayed but nobody cared to communicate this to us. Then on the 16.06.2019.

The ticket price was very reasonable (1000 dollars cheaper than the nearest alternative) and my previous experience on Air China 777's was pretty good. I regret to say that the overall experience left a lot to be desired. The plane was fine. Their B777 Business Class is in a 2-2-2 configuration which is not fabulous but is perfectly comfortable. The seats are good. The planes lack wifi, which is a real pity, but otherwise there is a good IFE system. The crews work hard and try to please. They lack coordination and finesse in the sense that they bring you the meal, and 20 minutes later, after you're finished, they pass out the bread. But those are minor issues compared with the real problem of this flight. The routing goes through Houston (they call it a ""Technical Stop"" but there is nothing technical to it). Get your stuff. Get out of the plane. Pass US immigration. Wait for your luggage. Clear US Customs. Then haul your luggage to a different terminal to Check in all over again. Clear security again. Then wait for the flight. The experience was horrible! It is clear why they have to leave set aside 4 hours for everyone to pass immigration and get their luggage and check back in. If they had arranged the ""Technical Stop"" through Canada, it would have been much simpler, I think. You still need to clear immigration, but at least you don't have to wait for luggage, clear customs and then find a different terminal! In Mexico you don't even need to clear immigration during the stop. The same circus happened in Houston on the return trip. So while it's great that the Air China have started flying to Panama, they really need to re-think their routing, because what they have is awful. Ideally, they would use a 787 and fly nonstop, but if a stop needs to be made, the worst place to make it is in the US. They would have been better off doing the technical stop in Mexico or in Toronto. It's a pity, since they're spending a lot of money to develop the route, and their equipment is good, their safety record excellent, their employees work hard and are professional, and the whole experience gets botched by their choice of ""Technical Stop"".

The flight attendant gave a brief instructions and left. My credit card was charged but the page crashed. I could not use the service. Again I had to asked for help, the flight attendant came and advised that she cannot troubleshoot and we have to chat with ground.  My husband had to spend half an hour just to get the refund for that transaction. I was given a notice to hold my baby when the seat belt sign was on for so long during the flight and there was no turbulence.  We were offered hot drinks two times during the flight and due to the turbulence we could not have them, I understand it's because of safety but they should come back after the seat belt sign is off to serve those who wish to have hot drinks. This is a service that it has been paid for. At the time of check-in we asked for a seat with bassinet. Although that there was a free one but we had to pay extra plus since the baby was older than 1 year, he could not use the bassinet due to the safety issue.  So what's the use of paying extra if I cannot use the bassinet in this flight.  The food was awful. There was absolutely no accommodation for the young children and babies, Unfriendly staff.

I booked a flight from BRU to SFO, but due to weather and slow ground operations at DUB airport I ended up missing my connection to SFO. I got rebooked onto a flight from DUB to JFK and JFK to SFO. Not only did this add 15 additional hours to my trip they also managed to lose my bags in JFK. When I finally arrived in SFO at 3am after 30h of traveling, all 3 of my bags were missing. Additionally I had made a bid to upgrade to business class, based on the information I was given: a flight from DUB to SFO. However when I got rebooked, I got downgraded to economy for the second leg of the flight. And of course, availability isn’t always there, but when I raised this issue with them, they refused to compensate me or give me a partial refund. Over the course of 4 days I made over 16 phone calls, filled out multiple complaint claims, reached out to them on twitter. But they did nothing to help me retrieve my bags. I kept getting the same standard answer over and over again: As American Airlines were your final carrier they will need to trace the missing baggage. In our industry, it's the final carrier's responsibility to return the delayed baggage. They will work directly with us on your behalf to return the bags to you as soon as possible. And indeed, they tried to work with Aer Lingus. They put in 3 requests to get the bags transferred onto their system. But Aer Lingus was  unresponsive. I also reached out to Aer Lingus’s own delayed baggage department, who also put in a request and sent 2 emails to raise this issue. Yet again, not a single response from Aer Lingus. As a result, my bags are still being held hostage in the Aer Lingus terminal at JFK. After yet another attempt to raise awareness with Aer Lingus on twitter, I got shut down without any meaningful response. This seems to be their thing: making customers go away as fast as possible while providing zero help. Filing a complaint on Aer Lingus has been designed to frustrate and infuriate people.

,Air Berlin,Economy Class,,20th May 2015,2,1,0,Australia,1,no,In May 2015 I caught the flight from Chicago O'Hare to Berlin Tegel. The aircraft was an Airbus 330. I was allocated a window seat but had no window. A woman who had paid an extra $50 for a window found herself in the same position but was not given a window. The aircraft was very overheated and had no individual air vents above the seats. The individual lights above my seat illuminated my neighbour rather than my seat. There were inadequate numbers of toilets for the large number of passengers. This resulted not only in severe discomfort for passengers but the water supply ran out in the toilet closest to me resulting in toilet paper not being flushed. The food was as cheap and nasty as I have ever had in Economy. I am not tall but had very little leg room. I could do very little work not only due to the shortage of space but the intense heat of the aircraft. The TV and movie selection was OK but not great but the TV screen in the back of the seat in front of me kept skipping or freezing every time the passenger in that seat vibrated the seat - extremely irritating. On approach to Berlin droplets of water started to drip on me and the passengers around me. On arrival the aircraft parked a very long distance from the terminal building. We were bussed to the terminal - this took about 10 minutes. We were then kept on the bus for another 10 minutes before being released into fresh air. The terminal for Air Berlin at Tegel turned out to be a shed with only 4 customs officers for hundreds of non-EU passengers. It took about an hour in a line to clear customs. (EU passengers cleared in minutes due to their automated passport readers.) I am a QANTAS frequent flyer and ended up on Air Berlin because it is a One World partner with QANTAS. How Air Berlin managed to join that partnership of good to excellent airlines is a mystery only the executives of those airlines can answer. I will be complaining to QANTAS and Air Berlin directly. The small number of flight attendants worked very hard and were pleasant but I felt sorry for them.,,1,2,air-berlin,Air Berlin customer review,,,1,0,7a5c0222-47c9-4f2c-a7e6-1e330978dfa3
,Air Berlin,Economy Class,,11th May 2015,1,4,0,UnitedArabEmirates,4,no,Booked a flight back home to Abu Dhabi from Berlin with Air Berlin not by choice as I actually booked it through Etihad Airways. The whole experience left me rather bitter and I really don't see the value add from Etihad Airways in partnering with Air Berlin. The following were my experiences with Air Berlin: 1) Couldn't reserve a seat on Air Berlin since my reservation code was tied to Etihad's. Had to make a call to Air Berlin but the initial response from them was to call back Etihad since they couldn't see my reservation in their system. However Etihad told me to call them back again since the flight was to be operated by them and they should see it in their system. After calls to-and-fro Air Berlin managed to retrieve my reservation and assist to reserve a seat (which came with a fee). 2) Baggage limit was only at 23kg. My outbound flight from Abu Dhabi to Frankfurt which was operated by Etihad Airways itself was 30kg. So I had to pay for the excess since I needed to bring back lots of stuff back from my trip. To make things worse the counter at Tegel Airport could not accept my credit cards apparently again because the reservation code was tied to Etihad's and so the payment couldn't be booked to release my boarding pass. So I made a mad dash to withdraw cash and had to go to a Baggage Service counter in exchange for a receipt since Air Berlin does not handle cash. From this experience I will not consider Air Berlin for long-haul flights anymore (being charged for seat reservation and low baggage limit) as there are many other alternatives that can provide more value and cost savings. Nor will I fly with any of the Etihad Airways partners anymore since their systems don't seem to be well-linked up with each other.,,4,5,air-berlin,Air Berlin customer review,,,1,0,00062d89-9d01-4857-b8c6-fe3ce2b63a90

Was a bit worried about flying them when I saw how cheap they were compared to other airlines, and because both their website and app make no sense in both French and English. It looks like the Chinese version went through a translating software and left that way. Playing around clicking on everything through their app made me realise I was admissible to free VIP lounge access due to the length of my layover, that was not long enough to be allowed out of the airport (EU citizens can request free 48h visa for any international transfer in any major Chinese city, HongKong/Macao/Taiwan included, but the customs decide if they will let you out or not by judging how long your layover is). Online check in on the app crashed, and made me wait a bit longer at CDG for manual check in. And my flight wasn't eligible to online check in anyway because there is no baggage drop counter for Air China at CDG. Went through a messy process but always on time. They did check the weight of my hand luggage. On my way inbound clerk was new and asked me if I was ok getting my luggage back in Shanghai and re-checking it in. I said no, she went for help and managed to check my luggage for transfer. Was a bit longer than usual but it saved me the hassle. Boarding was only 20 minutes before departure but it didn't make them late. Layover in Shanghai was a long process through customs and health check. Then despite being economy I had free access to VIP lounge with free food, drinks and bathrooms with showers. Food buffet was like a good hotel breakfast buffet. Everything was comfy but WiFi was pretty bad though. The snack on my short flight from Shanghai to Taipei was just not edible though. I still don't know if it was supposed to be cold noodles or celery because it was tasteless and texture was like plastic. It was a snack and I wasn't hungry thanks to the lounge buffet so whatever. Boarding and unboarding in Shanghai was always by bus, so boarding time was 1h before take off. Aircraft was old 330-200, had crumbs everywhere and the old carpeting smell.

IFE's touchscreen was dead on both ways and I had to use the buttons on the armrest to use it, and it was laggy but usable. I pre ordered a fat free meal, got steamed fish and pasta with veggies and plain tomato sauce and mushroom omelette outbound, fried tofu noodles and carrot puree with veggies on my way inbound. Looked way better than the other regular meals (greasy noodles and porridge). No snacks. Drinks were served 4 times, no black tea, only green tea, and would often come to suggest drinking water. Staff were not smiling but they were efficient and not being rude, I was fine with that. They also prevented two passengers from fighting.

The onboard service is excellent, although you have to pay for snacks and drinks they are served fast, efficiently and with a smile.

,Aer Lingus,Economy Class,April 2019,5th May 2019,1,1,1,Canada,1,no,"Conclusion: avoid Aer Lingus if you are traveling as a family. They do not respect the value of family and no one is willing to take any responsibility after our horrible experience with them. What happened: We booked a returned flight from/to Toronto to Frankfurt. We were traveling with our 9 month old baby. Right after we booked and paid the tickets, we called the agent to request a baby bassinet and priority seats both ways immediately. We flew from Toronto to Frankfurt with bassinet, no problem. But the agent said we need to make another call before our return flight to reserve the bassinet. 48 hours before our return flight on April 1st, we called the Aer Lingus office in Germany where we would board the flight. They told us they have no access to the seating system and asked us to go to the airport counter for requesting the bassinet. We arrived three and a half hours before the scheduled flight time to check in and to request the bassinet (We were the second in line after the counter was opened). The person on the counter told us, she has no access to the flight from Dublin to Toronto, which is the long flight after our first short flight from Frankfurt to Dublin. She asked us to request the bassinet seat when we transferred at Dublin airport. I asked her, there will only be less than 2 hours transfer time, wouldn't the seats all be taken? What if we do not get a bassinet seat? She said she cannot help and we can only go and find out there. We arrived at Dublin airport, when we went to check in for the second flight, which is going to be 7 and half hours long from Dublin to Toronto. The lady at the counter said there is no bassinet seats anymore and she cannot help us. She told us rudely that there is nothing she can do and we can only go board the plane and ask the cabin crew for the seat change. We boarded the plane EI129, and of course it is full and there was no single crew member who was willing or able to help us at all. We were sitting in the middle seats. Carrying a 9 month old baby at hand. No extra seats or spaces were beside us. And all the crew members were very unfriendly to us. One of them told us it was because there was a last minute cabin change so two families with babies could not get the bassinet seats including us. They even told us: sorry this happened every week I saw many families always left without their requested prioirity seats in the end especially for Sunday and Monday flight. During the whole 7 and a half flight, we did not feel well at all. No one helped us, no one cared about us. Even when my husband was standing beside the hallway to rock the baby and tried to let her sleep because our seats were so tight and small she couldn't nap, one of the crew member came to us and said we cannot stand there. (The seat belt sign was not on at the moment). The baby was crying nonstop because she was so tired but kept getting disturbed by these actions. We asked to speak to the cabin manager three times, and throughout the whole flight not once he came to communicate with us. We felt deeply sad about the unfortunate experience. We contacted Aer Lingus customer service and no one is willing to take responsibility and respond to us.",Dublin to Toronto,1,1,aer-lingus,all the crew members were very unfriendly,Family Leisure,Trip Verified,1,0,db695610-a519-4269-99ce-f833a591237f

Checked in online with no problem. Staff was nice and as soon we were airborne service began. The cabin had a nice smell of fresh coffee and fresh baked roll for breakfast. Soon I was served a cup of hot coffee one glass of apple juice and a hot saltbread roll. All was tasty and the crew was very nice on a one hour flight. Cockpit informed about flight.

,Air Berlin,Economy Class,,3rd April 2015,5,4,0,Sweden,2,no,I flew from Stockholm (ARN) to New York (JFK) via Berlin on March 29th (AB 8003 and AB 7248). The first stretch was 30 min late and I was forced to run through the terminals to get to my departure gate for JFK. I received no support or information from AB. Upon arrival at the gate I was informed that there was a 5 hour delay for the JFK flight. There was no information on the cause of the delay and staff appeared to be very confused. After 4 hours it was announced that there was another hour delay. The flight finally left over 6 hours behind schedule. The only compensation we received was a bottle of water and bag of chips. The return flight on April 2nd (AB 7249) was also delayed. Originally the delay was 40 min and then turned into over an hour. I therefore missed my connection back to Stockholm and was booked on a flight 4 hours later. The only compensation was again a bottle of water and bag of chips. The quality of the service once the plane was airborne was quite good and the entertainment system excellent (when it worked I was unlucky enough to have a malfunctioning screen on the return flight). In conclusion if you can afford to arrive late then the low ticket prices can make this airline attractive. However I will never fly them again given this rather miserable experience. The combined delays cost me over 10 hours of my life.,,3,4,air-berlin,Air Berlin customer review,,,2,0,21d1e9f0-4107-4499-9573-01b08ce02c48

I even sent an email to them but as their services are so poor they did not bother to reply.  When I asked the flight attendant regarding the meal options, she had no idea what lactose allergy is and she does not speak English. She gave me bread rolls with butter for the dinner.

I went to the complaint, they brush me off by saying no English, No compensation or resolution. I got told to get things done in Auckland. I called their Auckland office and left a voice message but no one called me back, as usual, they did with the email.

The Airport check in process was acceptable, although a bit understaffed with only 3 counters open for a 300 seat aircraft. The ground staff were very nice to have allocated me an emergency exit row seat, free of charge. Upon boarding one thing that was immediately obvious was the unusually hard cushioning on the seat back, upon close inspection there appears to only be about half a centimeter of foam. The inflight entertainment system also performed mediocrely, with laggy inputs and in this flight in particular requiring 3 separate reboots, with each taking about half an hour. The food and drinks is pretty much what you will find on an international flight like this, although lacking in western style food in general.

Tel Aviv to Moscow in a Boeing 777-300 in Business. Comfortable seats, nothing out of this world, crew very polite and friendly, especially the ladies. The males seem more reserved. Cultural thing in the Russian service industry? The cabin was almost empty, but attention was lacking, apparently there were two VIP passengers onboard, and the crew gave them most of the attention. I had to ask for water twice. Most Airlines supply you with a bottle of water to begin with. Lunch service very long and food portions and quality average at best. Transferring in freezing Moscow (-6c) by bus to the Narita bound aircraft, no special bus for business passengers, its ok by Aeroflot to pay 5000usd per ticket and to sit in a frozen crowded bus for a long time. Onboard a charming welcome as usual, but business seats in the A330-300 too hard, an extra mattress is needed like many other airlines do these days to increase comfort. Dinner service took long (3 hours from take off to finish) leaving us with 6 hours to sleep, but wake up call (optional) for breakfast is 2 hours before landing, leaving passengers to sleep 4 hours or give up breakfast. WiFi for a fee in Business is unreal. Purchased a 10USD package that expired before one site could be up. Waste of money. Didn't use again the whole trip (4 segments). Return NRT-SVO-TLV, the first portion again on A333 but in Economy! My request to have four seats for myself and my 11 yr old son, so he could sleep was answered by ""we are completely full"" - so moved us to a two seater by the window. After takeoff I counted at least 10 rows of 4 seaters with one or two passenger at the most. So much for telling the truth. The agent could have blocked the seats between us, and release them for others if need be. For someone who paid so much for those tickets, I expected more cooperation. I asked to check an upgrade fee, but the ticketing agent took over an hour to calculate the difference in fare, but failed to come up with a confirmed rate. We gave up, as we wished to eat and shop, and didnt fancy waiting so long at check in. Was that rocket science task?  Onboard crew less friendly than the usual, seats painfully crowded and very little padding. Food was average again ,most Japanese around me left the food untouched.

(No condiments - just the dry bread and the ham and cheese), and a child sized serving of apple sauce) On the return flight from Mexico City to Portland, ""Dinner' consisted of a 5 ounce cup of badly wilted ""greens"" which were garnished with a teaspoon of peas (No dressing just bare greens), a bare bun (No butter or other condiment), and about a Cup and a quarter of Rigatoni Pasta. This was garnished with about a teaspoon of unseasoned tomato sauce). The ""dessert"" was a small plastic tub of Vanilla Pudding-like product. Mexico is the home of Vanilla. This item contained none of that - it reeked of cheap artificial vanilla. Beverages are served in what appeared to be a 4 ounce portion. This included the Coffee and the water served on board. A six hour flight and four ounces of water per passenger. The Aeromexico hub is the Mexico City Airport. Each time, When we boarded the first leg of our flight, we were not told where to find the second leg of the flight. The airport is incredibly poorly marked - and no AeroMexico employee we talked to within the Mexico City airport could tell us where to go to find the second leg of our flight. On our return flight, the Departures Monitor told us that our flight would be leaving from ""Gate K"". Which is impossible because all of the actual gates at this airport bear numbers and not letters. It took us two hours to get of the first plane and find the second plane. There was not enough time to buy bottled water or any other alternative food. There are some significant issues with this airline.",Portland to Mexico City,1,1,aeromexico,significant issues with this airline,Business,Trip Verified,2,0,c2e9feff-aa1b-4711-a5e0-1d326fce6121

On a short 30 minute flight from Athens to Santorini you still get served mints and a snack. New planes with generous seating I would definitely fly Aegean again. Certainly worth the few extra bucks for great service and comfort. Not 5 stars as Santorini airport is a disaster and although Aegean doesn't own it, would love to see them put pressure on investing in its infrastructure.",Athens to Santorini,4,4,aegean-airlines,airline was so great,Couple Leisure,Not Verified,4,0,80661976-aff7-4af5-ac32-de258fadf353
,Aegean Airlines,Business Class,May 2018,23rd May 2018,2,5,4,UnitedKingdom,8,yes,"This review is about my recent trip with a friend from Athens (ATH) to Tel Aviv in the Aegean business class. 1) Athens airport: The airport in Athens has several lounges. Having a Star Alliance Gold card, we checked-out the Lufthansa lounge in the Schengen area before we made our way to the Aegean Lounge in the Non-Schengen area. Both lounges are above standard, but the Aegean lounge is better and we especially enjoyed the smoothies and sweets. Considering it is the flagship lounge of Aegean at their main hub, I wonder why it does not have shower facilities and an area to relax/sleep. On the other hand Aegean focusses on short- and medium-haul flights and does not find it necessary. 2) Seat: It would be great if Aegean would have a real business class chair. But like most – if not all – European airlines the business class had regular economy class seats with the middle seat being blocked by a table. The armrests could be moved sideways so the seat was wider. The seats in the first row offer enough legspace – only the emergency exit row in economy class has more legspace. There were no power outlets in the seat. 3) Onboard product: We found it nice that we were given menu and a wine carte. In addition to the meals offered onboard, business class passengers can pre-order other local dishes as well as special meals. I pre-ordered the Moussaka and it was really good. The airplane had overhead monitors were a film about Greece was shown. No WiFi and no personal device entertainment. 4) Verdict: Aegean offers a very good business class product compared to other European airlines. Seats should have power outlets. We were on vacation so power outlets and wifi were not that important to us. The onboard service is above standard and that is what was important to us.",Athens to Tel Aviv,4,5,aegean-airlines,offers a very good business class product,Couple Leisure,Trip Verified,5,1,e7742509-54d8-48ca-9116-fd2aa40d5577

A320,Aegean Airlines,Economy Class,May 2018,20th May 2018,0,5,5,Germany,7,yes,"Munich to Athens. We travelled in economy class in a tariff that includes luggage. Aegean is a member of Star Alliance, my friend holds an Aegean Gold Status and I am a United 1K. That gave us some advantages such as using the business class check-in, fast lane security and lounge access. The check-in in Munich is handled by Lufthansa and the agents were nice and professional. We used the business class counter and did not have a lot of wait time. Lufthansa lounges in Munich are good. Seat: Aegean sells seats in the emergency exit row, I find it disappointing that these are not offered for free to Aegeans/Star Alliance gold customers at the time of booking or at check-in.  The airplane was full and we had seats (aisle and middle) in the back of the plane. The seat spacing was comparatively very small. Onboard service: Even in economy, we were offered a full meal. Aegean offers a good selection of wines and soft drinks. The crew was very friendly. Aegean offers very good onboard service but the legspace was horrible. That is why I am subtracting three points. We had redeemed Upgrade Vouchers and were on the waiting list. Although seats were empty in Business Class (and up for sale), these were not released before take-off. Too bad.",Munich to Athens,2,5,aegean-airlines,very good onboard service,Couple Leisure,Trip
